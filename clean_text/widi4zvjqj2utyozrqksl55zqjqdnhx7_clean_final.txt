CONGRESSMAN CARNAHAN STATEMENT ON FUTURE OF HEALTH CARE REFORM Wednesday, March 3, 2010 Jim Hubbard, 202-225-2671 (WASHINGTON, DC) - Congressman Russ Carnahan (MO-3) issued the following statement reacting to President Obama's latest remarks on the status of health care reform legislation. "While progress has been stalled by partisan bickering and profiteers of the status quo in Washington, the costs of health insurance have continued to increase for thousands of Missourians. Don't take my word for it. Simply look to how much you were paying a year, five and ten years ago where on average the rates have doubled. "The fact is, health care costs are climbing out of reach for far too many Americans - Americans who could afford it just a few years ago. Doing nothing is simply not an option. We need to rein in costs by passing reforms that hold insurance companies accountable. After months and years of debate, we can pass health insurance reform that includes strong ideas from both parties. "It's time to have an up or down vote on whether to reform our health care system. Those who oppose holding health insurance companies accountable by forcing them to put patients first may try blocking needed reforms, but I refuse to turn my back on people I represent when our broken system requires action to improve our economy and our health care." -- Congressman Russ Carnahan (MO-3) ### 1 / 1
