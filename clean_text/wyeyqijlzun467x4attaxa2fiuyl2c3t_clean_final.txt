AGENDA ITEM #10 March 11, 2005 To: Delta Pro tection Comm ission From : Margit Aramburu, Executive Director Subject: Discussion of Possible of Joint A doption of Joint Resolution with the City of Elk Grove Regarding Inclusion of Lands in the Delta Prim ary Zone in the "Plann ing Area" within the City ' s General Plan ( For Commission Discussion and Possible A ction) RECOMMENDATION: Review and discuss the attached draft Joint Resolution, and de termine if the draft Joint Resolution addressees the concerns of the Co mmission raised at the May 2004 m eeting. If yes, vote to direct the Chairm an to si gn on behalf of the Commi ssion. If not, direct staff to respond with alternative language or actions. BACKGROUND: At its m eeting in May 2004, the Commission di scussed the City of Elk Grove' s newly adopted General P lan. T he City' s General P lan includes lands in the Primary Zone of the Delta that are labeled "Planning Area". The General Plan notes that the City has no jurisd iction over lands o utside the City Lim its and that any discussion of such lands are purely advisory. At the May m eeting, there was considerable disc ussion of the role of cities in the Primary Zone, and the role of the City of Elk Grove in the Prim ary Zone (see attached m inutes). The Chairman directed s taff to send a letter to the City requ esting a meeting to discuss the issues raised at the C ommission m eeting. Highlights from the m inutes include: • Concerns that the City' s Planning Area overlaps the boundaries of the Cosum nes Preserve. • Concerns that the City' s Planning Area overlaps the boundaries of the Stone Lakes National W ildlif e Ref uge. • Suggestion that the City delete from the General Plan any lands in the Prim ary Zone of the Delta, and that I-5 serve as the we stern boundary of the City and the City' s General Plan. • Suggestions that the City clarify to the Comm ission th e issues/concerns/possible future land uses for the lands in the P lanning Area in the Primary Zone of the Delta. • Concerns that other cities would designate portions of the Prim ary Zone a s Planning Areas within General Plans. 1

• From the public, con cerns that the C ity's designation could lead to inflated property values and expectations of landowners to the detrim ent of agriculture, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Comm issioner McGowan and Ms Aram buru m et with the Mayor , the City Counsel, and the Planning Director. At the end of th at meeting, Anthony Manzanetti, the City Counsel, agreed to respo nd to the iss ues raised b y the Commission. M r.

Excerpt fro m May 200 4 Minutes Briefing on the City of Elk Grove General Plan an d "Planning Area" Chairm an McCarty stated that the Cit y of Elk Grove adopted a Gen eral Plan and Planning Are a for its new city, which includes maps for planni ng areas and policies outside the city. He said some of the planning areas include lands that are locat ed in the prim ary area of the Delta. Ms. Aram buru reported tha t the new City of Elk Grove, which is located on the edge of the Delta, recently adopted a new general plan. Currently, the City does not include areas of the Primary Zone, therefo re the city is not required t o submit its plan for Commission review; however; there are lands located in the Pri mary Zone w hich are part of the Cit y’s Planning Are a. Mr. Eric Norris, Planning Department of the Cit y of Elk Grove reported that the City is outsi de the Primary and Secondar y Zones; however, it has a Planning Area outside of the City. He said that the areas on the sout hern boundar y of the Ci ty are included in the Secondary Zone; however they are unde r the jurisdiction of t he County of Sacramento. As of 200 2, Elk Gr ove’s land use policies reflect the Count y of Sacram ento' s Land Use Policies. He said the area is a large flood plain area which is constrained b y flooding from the Cosum nes River. Commissioner van Loben Sels asked if the City ’s Pla nning Area extends into The Nature Conservancy lands. He als o asked why the City doesn't pull back from the edge of the Prim ary Zone with the ir Planning Area. Mr. Norris said he did not believe th e City extend ed into TNC areas, but the City of Elk G rove was wor king co operatively with The Natu re Conservancy with open space issues. He furt her stated that when planning the city they used first physical boundaries, however, they did not use the Co mmission’s boundaries because they felt the y would not be m oving into the Pri mary Zone. Chairm an McCarty asked i f the Cit y was respec ting the Count y’s pl an, which is p art of the Commission’s plan, then w hy wasn’ t the C ity respecti ng the Commission’ s juris dictional boun daries. Mr. Norris responded t hat those lands were outside of Elk Grove ’s jurisdiction; however, if they came into Elk Grove’ s jurisdicti on th ose areas wo uld be added to the Elk Gr ove General Plan, but EG has n o intentio n of going int o the Co mmission’s jurisdiction. Commissioner Curtis stated that it was his understan ding that the City of Elk G rove was unable to provide m itigation for some endangered species i mpacts. He asked if the Cit y was try ing to designate a Sphere of Influence (SOI) as m itigation land for endangered species instead of leaving it under the Count y’s jurisdiction. Mr. Norris responded tha t this was not the case since the land in question was Planning Area land, not sphe re of Influence land, which are two different things. He s aid that in October 20 00, the City went before the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO ) for an application for a SOI that included all areas, but worked with the LAFCO to come back with a scaled back applicati on. However, the only part of the application that went forward was the area of Laguna West. He said the Cit y has an application o n hold with the LAFCO t hat proposes to include areas close to Gr ant Line Road (north of Highway 99), which are inside the Count y's urban service boundar y but o utside of the Commission' s jurisdiction. Commissioner Curtis state d that the Depart ment of Fish and Ga me was concern ed with the area that overlaps with the Stone Lakes National Wildlife refuge becaus e of the Pacific Flyway and large num ber of endangered species. He asked how the City’ s Planning Area deals with the area and potential mitigation for current growth of Elk Grove. Mr. Norris said that the City only addresse s the planning areas fr om a land use perspective a nd their land use is the sa me as that of the Sacramento Count y’s. H e said that they are mitigating the loss of habitat in El k Grove by collecting increas ed fees for the Swainson Hawk and the loss of agricultural land, and investigating the purchase of easements throug h entities like The Nature Conservancy . 5

Commissioner McGowan commented that expans ion of a new city usually causes great consternation with the neighbors and t he Commission should m ake responses on the im pending fears. Commissioner Coglianese stated that the Commis sion m ust come to terms with the fact of extensions of authorit y of other jurisdiction in t he Primary Zone th at could lead to urbanizatio n. She asked what the City’ s rationale was f or ente ring th e Prim ary Zone with poten tially urbanizi ng change in its Planning Are a. Mr. Norris responded th at the Plannin g Area is not an area the City of Elk Grove wants to include in its SOI now or in the future; nor does it believe the onl y reason for including an area in a ci ty is to urbanize it. Commissioner McGowan commented that he felt it was wrong and a mistake for the City of El k Grove to include areas in the Primary Zone in its Pla nning Area. He said the C ommission sh ould not sit b y quietly and allo w this to hap pen and the C ity shoul d be subject to the Delta Protection Act. Mr. Norris responded that he un derstood what was being said and suggested that the Commission have staff wri te a letter to the Elk Gr ove City Council to express their concerns. He said this was not a concern that the Council had h eard before; ther efore, it could consider revising the map at a f uture planning cy cle to sca le back the Planning Area to exclude anything in the Primary Zone . Commissioner Beltran said that the City of Elk Grove was “ stirring the pot” with its plan. He said that a lot of what was happening is a result of cities doing th ing like this, wi thout answering the question of "wh y" they are doing it. The Cit y of Elk Grove was making it v ery difficul t to be defended when the y cannot answer the question as to why they are includin g land in the Prim ary Zone in their planning area . He said that in or der to put the Comm ission at ease, the City of Elk Grove should write a letter to the Comm ission sta ting i ts reasoning for includi ng those lands. He said they should keep in mind that the y are a ne w city and to think this decision through because what they do affects what happens in other cities, because the Legislature is clos ely monitoring every thing going o n in the Prim ary and Secondary Zones. He said they shoul d give this area up, or subm it Letter of Intent. Commissioner van Loben Sels stated that the Commission should not o nly send a letter to the City of Elk G rove but also send represen tatives fro m RD 744, the Stone Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, the Cosum nes River Preserve and Comm ission staff to m eet with City . Mr. Norris sa id the best venu e for an y discussion would be at the City Council m eeting and he would put Ms. Aramburu in touch with the City Clerk to schedule a presentation on the Agenda. Commissioner Cabaldon commented that this would be a sim pler issue, but since the City of Elk Grove is not a participant in the Bluepri nt Proj ect the situation is am biguous. He said he felt Commissioner McGowan 's asse ssments were on targe t. He said he is concerned, but if it gets to the point of a SOI application then t he Commission could block t he application. He said he respected wh at the City of Elk Grove is try ing to do, but som e of the message s heard by other cities is not helpful. He said part of t he problem is that Elk Grove is the fastest growing cit y in the State of California. He said that sending a constructive letter ex pressing the Co mmission’s concerns would help avoi d the possi bility of a conflict down the roa d. Chair man Mc Carty said he agreed with Co mmissioner' s McGowan and Cabaldo n. He said he is concerned because the Co mmis sion has seen this before , most recently with the City of Stoc kton. He also said the City of El k Grove has an op portu nity to take a leadership role and bring reason to the process. Moreover, the City should recognize that Interstate 5 is a natural barrier that is not 6

--- Page 6 ---
going away , the Primary Zone has been designa ted by the State as "off lim its" an d the City’ s focus should be on the Secondar y Zone. Chair man Mc Carty convened the public hearing. Russell van Loben Sels, Reclamation District 744 trustee, suggested that the expansion of boun daries is not needed. He said that the City of El k Grove shou ld be encoura ged to ado pt the natural bou ndaries of Interstate 5, and th e Stone Lakes Wildlife Refuge. He said he would be happy to go to the Elk Grove City Council to relay the message. John Bohl, Clarksburg resident, said that the Cit y of Elk Grove is making a m istake as it relates to market value on lands that they m ay choose to ac quire in ease ments . He said the perception that they have ove rlain some boundaries is go ing to rai se the expectations of landown ers and raise the costs of the ease ments. He referenced a Sacra mento Bee arti cle that said that one of the biggest problem s in the City of El k Grove is acquiring a ffordable mitigation land. He ur ged the Cit y to make an amendm ent to the Pl anning Are a and delete it. Chair man Mc Carty closed the public hea ring It was moved by Comm issioner Beltran and seconded b y Comm ission Cabaldon that Commission staff write a letter to the Elk Grove City Council to have a meeting with the Commission for the Cit y to reconsider its inclusi on of its planning area within the Pri mary Zone, and based on that action, follow up that meeting with another meeti ng between the Commis sion, the City Cou ncil and the Mayor of Elk Grove. The motion was approved by voice vote. Commissioner van Loben Sels abstained. Commissioners McGowan and Cabaldon volu nteered to m eet with the City of El k Grove. 7

Note: The following information w as in the May 2004 staff report: CITY B ACKGROUND: The City was incorporated in July 2000. The City adopted its new General Plan on Nove mber 19, 2003. LOCATION OF THE CITY OF ELK GROVE: The City lim its lie sou th of the City o f Sacram ento and north of Ka mmerer Road. The City is bounded on the west by I-5 and includ es lands east of Highway 99. The City recen tly ann exed the Laguna W est area. The Ci ty is east of the Prim ary Zone of the Delta, however, a very sm all area along I-5 and north of Elk Grove Boulevard is in the Secondary Z one. REVIEW B Y DELTA PR OTECTION COMMISSION: The Comm ission' s law requires that local gov ernments ensure th at their g eneral plans are consistent w ith the Comm ission' s regional plan for lands in the Primary Zone . While the current City of Elk Grove city lim its do not include any areas in the P rimary Zone, the City' s newly adopted General P lan does incl ude and discuss lands in the Prim ary Zone. The General Plan Introduction, p. 5, states: Two-Tiered Planning: In addition to planni ng fo r Elk Grove, this Genera l Plan Addresses a "Planning A rea" outside the ci ty limits. This Planning Area was defined during the process of applying to the Sacramento County Local Agency Formation Committee for a Sphere of Influenc e; it represents the area w hich the City envisio ns may ultim ately b e included eith er in a Sphere o f Influence o r in the incorporate d city limits. While the City has no jur isdiction ov er the determination of land use policy in adjacent areas, it can advise the County on land use policy. Outside the city limits, ther efore, this Ge neral Plan is purely advisory, although it does provide a statemen t of the uses the City desires in these areas. Reflecting the limit of the City's authority to regulate land uses outside its current corporate boundaries, this General Pl an provides land use and other policy direction in the following manner: • For the area within the c ity limits and with in the area currently proposed by the City to b e includ ed within its Sphere of Influence… this General Plan provides a detailed Land Use Policy Map and other specific policies relating to land use and other issues. (The City in November 2000 applied to the Sacramento County LAFCO for approval of a Sphere of Influence which includes these areas…) • For the area outside the city limits, this General Plan provides land use designations at a more conceptual level ; because the City does not have land use authority in these areas, detailed land use categories have not been assigned, and the policies of this Gene ral Plan with regard to other issues (Circulation, housing, noise, etc.) are advisory only and are intended to be 8

--- Page 8 ---
considered by the County of Sacra mento in its review and approval of development projects an d other matte rs in th is larger "planning area". PROCESS IF THE CI TY ADDS LAND S IN THE PRIM ARY ZONE TO THE CITY LIM ITS: As discussed previously, if the City does incorporate lands in th e Prim ary Zone in th e city limits, the C ity will have to subm it its General Plan to the Co mmission f or review and a determ ination of consistency. W hen th e Comm ission reviews a local governm ent General Plan, the Comm ission m ust approve the local general plan by a majority vote of the Comm ission m embership ( ten vo tes) af ter m aking all of the following written findings regarding the general plan and any de velopm ent approved or proposed that is consistent w ith the General Plan (P ublic Resources Code, Section 29763.5): • Consistent with the regional plan (L and Use and Resource Managem ent Plan for the Prim ary Zone of the Delta). • Will not res ult in we tland or ripa rian loss. • Will not res ult in the de gradation of water qua lity. • Will not res ult in increased nonpoin t source po llution. • Will not res ult in the de gradation or reduction of Pacif ic Flyw ay habitat. • Will not res ult in reduced public access, provid ed the access does not infringe on private property rights. • Will not expose the pub lic to increas ed flood hazard. • Will not adversely im pact agr icultura l lands o r increas e the p otential f or vandalism , trespass, or the creation of public or pr ivate nuisances on public or private land. • Will not res ult in the de gradation or impairm ent of levee inte grity. • Will not adversely im pact naviga tion. • Will not res ult in any in creas ed requ irements or restrictions u pon agricu ltural practices in the Prim ary Zone. DESCRIPT ION OF THE CI TY OF ELK GROVE: The City of Elk Grove' s planning area incl udes 93,560 acres in southern S acram ento County. The City lim its include 26,910 acres (42 square m iles); this includes the area known as Laguna W est that was recently annexe d into the City. The City and planning area are bounded by the Stone Lakes National W ildlife Refuge and the Sacram ento River to the wes t, the Cities of Sacram ento and Rancho Cordova to the north and the Cosum nes River to the south eas t. W ithin the la rger planning area lie the unincorporated community of Hood, to the west, and the area kn own as Point Pleasant, to the south. The City has two m ajor north-south freew ays--I-5 and 99. Several large east-west expressways connect these two highways. DESCRIPT ION OF PRIMARY ZONE L ANDS WITHIN THE CIT Y LIMITS: There ar e no lands in the existing city limits in the Prim ary Zone. However, substantial lands west o f I-5, south of the City o f Sacram ento and north of Twin Cities Road are identified as "Planning Area" and included on maps in the City' s General Plan. 9

--- Page 9 ---
The Elk Grove General Plan Glossary (p. 188) defines Planning Area as "the area directly addressed by the general plan. A city' s planning areas typically encom passes the city limits and potentially annexable land within its sphere of influence." CURRE NT GENERAL PLAN DESIGNATI ONS (SACRAMENT O COUNT Y): Lands west of I-5 are lo cated in Sacram ento County. The Genera l Plan designation is "Agricultural Cropland". CURRE NT ZONING (SACRAME NTO COUNTY): Lands lying west of I-5, and bounded by Ellio tt Ranch Road and Hood Franklin Road are zoned RR(F), Recreation Reserve, with Flood ov erlay. Other lands to the north and south of the RR area, and west of I-5 are zoned AG-80(F), Agriculture with 80 acre m inimum parcel with Flood overlay. CITY OF ELK GROVE GENE RAL PL AN DESIGNATIONS: The Plannin g Area Land Use Concept Map (attac hed) identifies the lands west of I-5 as "Open Space Reserve an d Lim ited Developm ent--Constrained by flooding." CITY OF ELK GROVE Z ONING: As the lands in the Planning Area are not in th e City lim its, the City has not adopted any zoning for lands in the "Planning Area". CITY OF ELK GROVE GENERAL PLAN POLICIES REGARDING THE PRIMARY ZONE OF THE DE LTA: (Note: Text in italic is quoted from the City of E lk Grove General Plan) CONS ERVATION AND AIR QUALITY ELEMENT: Sacramento River Delta (page 43) : Although not within the current incorporated boundaries of Elk Grove, a portion of the Sacramento River Delta is inside the larger Planning Area of the General Plan…Therefore, the City's long-term land use policies will require coordination with the Delta Protection Commission (a state agency) once thes e lan ds are inclu ded within the corporate boundary of Elk Grove. Mission Statement: The mission of the Commission is to guide the protection of the Delta's unique natural quality, cultural viability, economic vitality, and recr eational opportunity through: • Protection maintenance, and enhancement and re storation of the overall quality of the Delta environment in cluding agriculture, wildlif e habitat, and recreational activ ities; • Assurance o f orderly, ba lanced cons ervation and developmen t of Delta la nd resources; • Improvement of flood protection to ensure an increased level of public health and safety. Vision Statement: 10

--- Page 10 ---
The vision of the Delta P rotection Commission is a region in which the essential land uses and unique natural qualities flour ish in self-sustaining harmony. Conservatio n Policies: Conservatio n of Agricultural Uses: CAQ-3: The City of E lk Grove considers the on ly mitiga tion for the loss of agricu ltural land to consist of the creation of new agricul tural land in the Sacramento region equal in area, productivity, and other characteristics to the area which would be lost due to development. The protection of existing agr icultu ral land thro ugh the purchase of fee title of easements is not considered by the City to provide mitigation since programs of this type result in a net loss of farmland. CAQ-4 : While agricultural uses are anticipated to be phased out within the city limits, the City recognizes the right of these uses to continue as long as individual owners/farm ers desire. The City shall not require buffers between farmland and urban uses, relying instead on the following actions to address the impac ts of farming on urban uses: Action 1: Implement th e City "Right to Farm" Or dinance. Action 2: Prospective buyers of property ad jacent to agricultural land shall be notified through the title report that they could be subject to in convenience or discomfort resulting fro m accepted farming activities as per provision s of the City's r ight-to-farm ordinance. Conservatio n Policie s: Land within the Prima ry Zone of th e Sacramen to River Delta: CAQ-6: Within the Primary Zone of the Legal Delta…the City's land use and other policies shall conform with the "Land Us e and Resource Management Plan for the Primary Zone of the Delta" develope d by the Delta Protection Commission. Action 1: Coordinate with the Delta Protect ion Commission by providing updates on the status of any requests by the C ity to include any lands in th e Primary Zone in the City's sphere of influence or incorporated boundaries. Action 2: Prior to the annexation of any l and in the Primary Zone of the Legal Delta, ensure that this General Plan is consiste nt with the Delta Pr otection Commission's Act and Plan as it affects the area within the Primary Zone. LAND USE ELEME NT: Sphere of Influence an d Annexation (page 122) : This General Plan provides land use planning for the City and a larger P lanning Area. The Planning Area is intended to be an area in which the City has an interest in guiding land use decisions by the County of Sacrament o, and is envisioned as the area into which the inco rporated city bo undaries ma y eventua lly expand. Land Use Polic ies: Are as Outside the Incorporated Area of Elk Grove: LU-12: The Land Use Policy Map of the Planning Area (Figure LU-2) provides conceptual land use policy for the area outsi de the current incorporated boundaries of Elk Grove. This policy is intended as a stat ement of the City's l ong-term vision for this area; these lands remain unde r the jurisdiction of Sacrame nto County. Except where specifica lly indicated, th e City's land use policy for areas outsi de th e city limits reflec ts the County of Sacramento's land use poli cy as it existed on December 31, 2002. 11

--- Page 11 ---
Land Use P olicies: Urban Study Areas LU-17: Implement a comprehensive and city-wide strategy for the preservation of open space, habitat and agriculture, both inside and outside the City's existing city limits. Action 1: Within 90 days of the adoption of this General Plan, staff shal l bring to the City Council for its consideration opt ions available for the stra tegic funding, acquisition and management of land in and proximate to th e City for the purposes of preserving open space, habitat and agriculture. PARKS, TRAILS AND OP EN SPACE EL EMENT: Trails and Open Space (p. 149) : An important component of the community's vision for the future of Elk Grove is the retention of significant amounts of open space in the Planning Area…and the creation of a trails sy stem to link the developmen t portion s of Elk Grove with these areas…the City rec ognizes that there are many important open space resources in the P lanning Area, incl uding…the Delta and agricultural areas. PTO-15: The City views open space lands of al l types as important resource which should be preserved in the region, and supports the establishment of multi-purpose open space areas to address a variety of needs, including, but not limited to: • Maintenance of agricultural uses • Wild life hab itat • Recreational open space • Aesthetic benefits • Flood control To the extent possible, lands protected in accordance with this policy should be in proximity to Elk Grove, to facilita te use of th ese a reas by Elk Grove resid ents, ass ist in mitigation of habitat loss with in the City, and provide an open space resource close to the urbanized areas of Elk Grove. Action 1: Consider the establishmen t of a cityw ide fee and/or assessment system which would provide funding for the purchase of open space land or easements and the maintenance of these areas. Action 2: Work with th e County of S acramento a nd other resource agencies to d evelo p a regional open space plan which provides for mu ltiple uses of open space (e.g. agriculture and wildlife foraging) . Action 3: Consider using funds collected unde r existing (2003) fee programs (e.g. Swainson's Hawk mitigation and E ast Franklin Specific Pla n agricultur al mitiga tion) to fund this expanded open space program. SAFETY ELEMENT Drainage and Flooding (p. 173): SA-13: The City sha ll requ ire th at all n ew projects not result in new or increased flooding impacts on adjoining parcels on upstream and downstream areas. SA-15: Development sh all not b e permitted on l and subject to flooding d uring a 100-year event, based on the most recent flood plain m apping prepared by the Federal Emergen cy management Agency (FEMA) or updated mappin g acceptab le to the City of Elk Grove… 12

13SA 16: A buildable area outside the 100-year fl oodplain must be present on every residential lot sufficient to accommodate a re sidence and associated structures. Fill may be placed to create a buildabl e area only if approved by th e City and in accordance with all other applicable policies and regulations. The use of fill in the 100-year floodplain to create buildable area is strongl y discouraged, and shall be subj ect to review to determine potential impacts on wildlife, habitat, and flooding on other parcels.
