The Permittees request the extension to submit the Work Plan in order to continue focusing efforts on accelerating the shipment of aboveground transuranic waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. This is the second extension to submit the Work Plan (the previous extension was granted on July 16, 2013).

Messrs. Maggiore and Mousseau January 3, 2014 NMED is concerned over delays that affect the progress of groundwater characterization and remediation; however, NMED is aware of the current uncertainties associated with the allocation of DOE resources to the Permittees to fund groundwater monitoring and cleanup at the Laboratory. The Permittees must notify NMED, within seven days of receipt of such information, should funds become available in the future that allow for the Work Plan to be submitted prior to June 30, 2014. If funding becomes available , NMED may re-evaluate the deadline for completion of this project. Should you have any questions, please contact Ben Wear of my staff at (505) 476-6041. Sincerely, OAftw John E. Kieling Chief Hazardous Waste Bureau cc: T. Blaine, NMED EHD D. Cobrain, NMED HWB N. Dhawan, NMED HWB B. Wear, NMED HWB J. Kulis, NMED HWB M. Dale, NMED HWB S. Yanicak.
