Sincethat time, NRCS has received$30,883,345 for its EQIP program,and entered into 2,225 contractswith New Mexico farmers andranchers for conservation improve-ments. Some 7,625,990 acres of NewMexico farm and ranch land hasbenefited from these conservationpractices, or 13 percent of allprivate land in the state. Of critical importance, in a statewhere water and irrigation are soessential, over 300,000 of irrigationimprovements have been madethrough EQIP since 1996. Viewedanother way, NRCS has invested$12,389,799 to improve irrigationsystems, accounting for 40 percentof all EQIP funds. This investmenthas resulted in installation of 364sprinkler systems, 600 miles ofpipeline and concrete ditches, andland leveling on 571 projects. All of this investment has helped NewMexicans save precious water whileraising the agriculture products uponwhich this nation depends. Seventeen percent of the FarmBill funds in New Mexico have goneto livestock water development,amounting to an investment of$5,098,856. With these funds,ranchers have installed 450 wells,1,179 miles of pipeline, and 1,314watering tanks. Another $6,632,204 has beenexpended to alleviate brush thatsucks water from the state’s range-lands. Ranchers have treated363,996 acres for brush, andaccounted for 21 percent of thestate’s total EQIP funds to do this. Polls have shown that water isone of New Mexico’s top issues. Itcontinues to garner much attentionthroughout the state. NRCS’sresponse to the drought in NewMexico has been multifaceted andextensive. From irrigated crop landsto range lands, the NRCS responsehas been felt. Drought in Las Vegas, New Mexico - Spring 2003

The 2002 Farm Billhas already invested$6,267,457 in 151 projects inNew Mexico, and much moreis to come. As NRCS Chief Bruce I.Knight said, “This is ... a greattime to thank the landownerswho have and will participate,to thank NRCS personnel,conservation districts, agricul- tural organizations, wildlife organizations, environmentalorganizations and all others who are all working tooptimize the opportunities before us.” Chief Knight said another thing that gets to the core ofthe magnitude of this legislation. He said, “Most agricultural producers can’t quote the600-page 2002 Farm Bill by line and verse. But theyknow one thing: It’s helping them become better stew-ards. By this time next year, tens of thousands of addi-tional farmers and ranchers will be receiving the assistancethey need to conserve, maintain and improve our soil, air,water, and plant resources. That’s because the Farm Bill provides an unprecedented investment in conservation -ranging from the Wetlands Reserve Program, to theEnvironmental Quality Improvement Program, to theWildlife Habitat Incentives Program, all of which buildupon our base Conservation Technical Assistance pro-grams.” The 2002 Farm Bill is a very positive step in thestewardship of our treasured New Mexican land, water,wildlife, and other natural resources. It is always encour-aging to me as I travel this state to meet and know NewMexicans who can envision the positive, even duringtough times. In my experience it is those who see thepositive and strive for it that really help us progress in thefield of natural resources. While NRCS is making great strides with the FarmBill, our partners are setting precedents that other statesare watching. Conservation Districts are realizing majoraccomplishments with their salt cedar projects. Inaddition, the New Mexico State Legislature appropriatedsignificant funding for technical assistance through the Soiland Water Conservation Commission. I, also, want to take this opportunity to recognizesome personal achievements of our partners. DebbieHughes, executive director of the New Mexico Associa-tion of Conservation Districts, was recently honored byCongresswoman Heather Wilson as an outstanding leaderat Women’s History Month Recognition in Albuquerque.And Levi Newkirk, New Mexico’s High School YouthForum winner, placed second at the International HighSchool Forum sponsored by the Society for RangeManagement. The High School Youth Forum judgesstudent papers that address any aspect of range manage-ment. It is with deep appreciation that I live and work in astate with such doers. Thank you, New Mexico, for agood year and the opportunity to be of service to you.

Natural Resources Reporter ( 3 ) Teams work to Improve Forest Health by Duston L. Hunt Jr. Recently the smoke from five controlled burns could be seen nearSilver City. These burns were con-ducted to reduce the threat of danger-ous wild fire, improve wildlife habitat,and improve watershed conditions.Though the reason for these burnswas the same, the process required toconduct them was different. Usually the Forest Service ad-dresses forest health issues on forestland with their own dollars and theirown personnel. Two of the recentburns, however, were collaborativeefforts made possible by a Memoran-dum of Understanding between GrantSoil & Water Conservation Districtand the Gila National Forest. Grant SWCD recognizes that thehazards created by 80 years of firecontrol are just as real on private andstate land as they are on the NationalForest. Roughly 50 percent of theland in Grant County is private orstate owned, and 50 percent isfederal. These different lands arerandomly intermingled. It doesn’tmake much sense to address thewildlife and watershed problems onone side of the fence if you can’t fixthem on the other side. Thanks to theMOU and a grant from the Environ-mental Protection Agency the foresthealth of the Mangas Creek water-shed is being addressed in a compre-hensive manner. First efforts to implement what isknown as the Mangas Water QualityProject were represented by theSchoolhouse and Cain prescribed burns. The 5,000-acre Schoolhouseburn was conducted by ForestService fire managers on ForestService land with the Grant SWCDconstructing numerous erosion controlstructures within the burn area. Thesestructures will begin the process ofhealing gullies. The 500-acre Cainburn was conducted entirely onprivate land and truly represents acooperative effort. The NaturalResources Conservation Service didthe initial studies and wrote the burnplan, while the work of conducting theburn was accomplished by the Cliff-Gila Volunteer Fire Department andNew Mexico State Forestry. Theeffort was directed by Ricky Sedilloand Mike Head, both experiencedUSDA Forest Service fire managers. These two burns, represent thefirst steps of the Mangas WaterQuality Project, and as a result, thewaters of Mangas Creek and the GilaRiver will eventually run clearer. Thehabitat of wildlife such as mule deerwill be greatly enhanced. It is also important to consider that collabora-tive efforts like the Mangas WaterQuality Project provide local propertyowners a certain amount ownership inthe success or failure of forest resto-ration efforts. A long-term goal of the MangasWater Quality Project is to heal thedeep erosion channel that runs thelength of Mangas Valley. Not muchcan be done with the channel until theovergrown forest condition in theuplands is addressed. Grant SWCDsees this as a long-term project,which must include the needs ofMangas Valley residents withoutthreatening those who depend on thisland for their livelihood. Theseresidents know they will be the onesto gain the most from a successfulwatershed restoration project or havethe most to lose if no management isundertaken.

Natural Resources Reporter ( 4 ) Natural Resources Reporter ( 3 )Holistic Irrigation Technology Provides Answers Drought Response Heralded As Hard Work But Doable At a time when New Mexico farmers, cities, and other interestsface extreme water shortages and thepress anticipates water wars, calmerheads in agriculture are quietly ad-vancing solutions that will require hardwork but are doable. Mike Sporcic, NRCS agronomist,is one of these conservation advo-cates with ideas. “Some of the solutions require ahuge commitment to management, butthe effort is worth it,” Sporcic said. The program that Sporcic sees asa solution for drought beleagueredNew Mexicans is the Holistic Irriga-tion Technology (HIT) program firstprepared by Rudy Garcia, LindaScheffe, John Allen, and R. DavidFischer, all of the New MexicoNatural Resources Conservation Service. The Holistic Irrigation Technologyhas some 22 points that can guideirrigation districts and producers tothe benefits of irrigation water man-agement. First, the program notes theinstallation of high flow structures canhelp improve irrigation efficiency fromless than 25% to over 60% due togreater uniformity of application withless water. High flow structures takeless time to put water to the end ofthe check, thus avoiding excessivesoaking of water into the ground.Because high flow structures take lesstime to irrigate there is also a savingsin labor. The time to irrigate a fieldcan be cut in half. Laser leveling increases irrigation application uniformity and overallirrigation efficiency. It is possible toapply 2 - 3 inches of water when theproducer has access to a large headof water and fields are laser leveledand irrigated with high flow turnouts. Water metering devices enableproducers to evaluate and implementalternative practices which willincrease his/her irrigation efficiency.This amounts to a significant saving inirrigation water. For example, watermetered on fields that are laserleveled and which also have high flowturnouts and lined ditches, has re-sulted in farmers being charged asmuch as 40% less per irrigation. “Putting all the hardware andmanagement into place can realize thiskind of savings,” Sporcic said. “TheElephant Butte Irrigation District doesa good job and is showing the ben-efits of all their work. We have othersthat are learning and working on this.” “There is still tons of work outthere to do. I just can’t emphasizethat enough.” In addition to high flow turnouts,laser leveling, and metering - measur-ing soil moisture can help identifyappropriate times to irrigate thuspreventing plant stress conditions.The result is higher crop yields andbetter quality products that translateinto a better profit margin for theproducer. Tensiometers, probes, orthe feel method can be used. Tensiometer are filled with water These efficient irrigation systems reduce evaporation of water.

Natural Resources Reporter ( 5 ) and measure the suction of the soil on that water. Coupled with a gauge, thetensiometer can show when themoisture in the soil has reached such alevel that it is time to water again.Soil texture, porosity, and crop typecan determine the total amount ofwater that is needed. Lettuce, forexample, uses a soil zone of one footwhile alfalfa uses four feet of soil. The Natural Resources Conserva-tion Service (NRCS) has developed aspread sheet that can determine theamount of water needed for any field.Farmers interested in this kind ofassistance should contact their localNRCS office. “This kind of assessment can betailored to the conditions of any givenfarm,” Sporcic said. “It should go inevery conservation plan in NewMexico. There just is no need to dowithout this valuable tool.” Using a probe for a soil moisturemeasurement entails a device that haselectrodes and measures conductivityacross two rods. The more moisturein the soil, the greater conductivity. Finally, the simplest method ofchecking soil moisture is by feel. Thiscan be a learned skill. All of these soil moisture testingsystems inherently rely on an “on-demand” irrigation system where thefarmer can call up the ditch rider andget irrigation water when needed,rather than on a rotational system. Installation of pipelines, whereappropriate, can be used to both conserve and convey water veryefficiently. Use of pipelines dependsupon the objectives of the farmer andthe irrigation district. If the mainobjective is to get water to the farm,pipelines are effective. If an objectiveis to recharge the aquifer in theprocess, the alternative transportsystems are used. Another important component of awell managed operation is properlymaintaining drains to keep the rootzone dewatered and provides for ahealth growing environment. Rootsdo not grow in water saturated soil.They need air to grow. Farmers needfive to six feet of soil to grow crops. Record keeping has proven to bean invaluable decision making tool forfarmers in their efforts to irrigate moreefficiently and effectively. NRCS hascreated the 449 Irrigation Manage-ment Job Sheet for this task. This isavailable at your local NRCS office. Reduced tillage in orchards showsan improvement of the soil surfacestructure and tilth (organic mattercontent) which translates into waterconservation. The development of nutrientbudgets has resulted in significantreductions in inputs of fertilizers, soilamendments, and other chemicals.Nutrient management is a part ofHolistic Irrigation Technology thatintegrates all aspects of farm opera-tions. NRCS staff can develop anutrient budget for cropland and uses New Mexico State University fertil-izer recommendations which can beused alone or in conjunction withdealer recommendations. There is a need to check preplantnitrates in the spring because nitratesmove with water and a farmer doesnot want to get nitrates into shallowwells. The goal is to keep nitratereserves to a minimum for this reason,and the cropland may not need more.This is an inexpensive test, $30 perfield plus time, and could cut fertilizercosts by 20 percent. Finally, there are a variety of dripirrigation systems on the market todaythat allow for the application of verysmall amounts of water which isparticularly important during earlygrowth stages. Such systems enablea grower to maintain optimum mois-ture conditions for best production,apply precise amounts of nutrients,and increase yields. They are 95percent efficient. “They require a huge commitmentof resources and management,”Sporcic said, “but the effort is worthit. Yields are up and diseases down.” “If you want to know what youcan do in drought, the Holistic Irriga-tion Technology Program is it. It callsfor some tough decisions, but it coulddrop our water use in this state by 30percent.” For further information contactMike Sporcic at 761-4424.

Natural Resources Reporter ( 6 ) Plant Materials Center Important to Park Service Mutton Grass and San Juan Pestemon Mark Spring Top: Dan Goodson harvesting mutton grass. Bottom: San Juan pestemoncolors field in purple at the Los LunasPlant Materials Center Mutton grass seed, falling to the blades of the harvester, recently marked springtime at the Los LunasPlant Materials Center. DanGoodson, agronomist, was harvestingthe seed for National Parks through-out the southwest. The National Park Service relieson the Los Lunas Plant MaterialsCenter for the production of plantspecies in which they are particularlyinterested. The seed the NationalPark Service uses must meet ex-tremely rigorous standards to preventcontamination. “ The Park Service requires seedsthat are descendant from ecosystemsin their parks,” said Greg Fenchel,Plant Materials Center manager. “Bybeing so exacting, these land manag-ers can assure that the plants grownfrom these seeds can, in the long run,tolerate the climate extremes of thesites where they are sown.” Mutton grass is important to theNational Park Service and othersbecause it is very palatable to elk andother grazing animals. It is the domi-nate grass component under Ponde-rosa pine. Like the Ponderosa pine itrequires significant water, 16 - 20inches per annum. In New Mexico itis typically found in 7000 - 9000 footaltitude areas. There is some debateabout its use after fires, and there arearguments why mutton grass shouldbe used and why small grains are preferred. Regardless of the debate,mutton grass is important in ourNational Parks and forestlandsthroughout the southwest. Like the harvesting of muttongrass, the blooming of the San Juanpestemon recently signaled the returnof warm weather at the Plant Materi-als Center. The pestemon is a wild-flower, great for xerioscaping inyards, along highways, and anywherewhere drought resistant flowers areneeded. “In the Albuquerque area,pestemon will thrive without anyirrigation, and at the Plant MaterialCenter in Los Lunas is grown withoutirrigation,” said Fenchel. “It typicallyrequires only 7 - 8 inches of water ayear.” It is a busy time for the PlantMaterial Center as it enters its pro-duction season. If you wish additionalinformation about mutton grass, SanJuan pestemon, or the Plant MaterialCenter contact Greg Fenchel at(505)865-4684.

Natural Resources Reporter ( 7 ) Brooks Responds to Challenges of Urban Office Complex Mosaic Thrives in Albuquerque Area Drought management in New Mexico is a long term responsibility,not just an emergency situation,according to Corinne Brooks, Albu-querque Field Office District Conser-vationist. Brook’s perspective resultsfrom managing a field office for thestate’s most urbanized conservationdistrict. “In general the healing or improv-ing of land does not happen overnight,Brooks said. “Most of our traditionalagriculture producers know this. Theland is their livelihood and they knowhow to care for the land, and have theforesight to do the proper planning.” The urbanized Albuquerquedistrict has many non-traditionalagriculture producers however,including hobby farmers, first timeirrigators, and small acreage landown-ers. Many of these individuals maybe on the learning curve, and wantinstant results or are reacting to thedry conditions rather than anticipatingthem. This complex mosaic of producersand land management skill levelsmake Brooks’ job both challengingand rewarding as she helps individualswith varied backgrounds bringconservation to the land. “I am not saying that other districtconservationists don’t also havechallenging jobs. It is just that thevariety of situations in an area border-ing the largest urban center in the statekeeps you on your toes,” said Brooks. Brooks also shared a perspectiveabout the drought. “This period of drier conditionsmay not really be a drought. Climateexperts point to recent wet years asbeing above normal and what wehave now may be closer to the norm.” Weather forecasters agree that thisdry period for New Mexico may beextended. Planners and politiciansalike are calling for the need forplanning for extensive dry periods inNew Mexico, and conservation anddevelopment of available watersources. Brooks says she does haveproducers who are adjusting to thedry conditions. “We do have producers who areadjusting crop rotations. By this Imean they may turn alfalfa into a cropthat uses less water on the fifth year ofthe crop rather than let the alfalfa goanother two or three years.” Land leveling and irrigation areamong other measures Albuquerqueproducers are taking. Irrigationimprovements concentrate on im-provements such as pipelines insteadof earthen ditches, ditch lining, andnew turnouts. “These are by far the majority ofpractices we are dealing with,”Brooks said. “Finally a concern of ours is thenumber of animals on the land whether it be irrigated pasture orrangeland.” In drought livestock producerscannot produce the forage for theanimals they can during wet years. “The same principles apply for thesmall producer on five acres with onlythree or four cows. That producermay need to get rid of one cow duringdry spells, while the large rancher mayneed to get rid of a hundred. Theystill have to cut back on the number ofanimals they are carrying on the land.” For more information about anurbanized field office, contact CorinneBrooks at (505)761-5444.
