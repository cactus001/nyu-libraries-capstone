The election to apply the provisions of the Act may be made only by a mine owner or operator with re-spect to brick and tile clay, fire clay, or shale which he mined and used in the manufacture of building or paving brick, drainage and roofing tile, sewer pipe, flower pots, and kindred products. The election must be made in accord-ance with §1.9004 –4 on or before Decem- ber 11, 1961, and the election shall be-come irrevocable on December 11, 1961. (c) Years to which the election is appli- cable.

The election is also effective for any taxable year beginning before Jan-uary 1, 1961, in respect of which an as-sessment of a deficiency has been made but not collected on or before Sep-tember 26, 1961.
