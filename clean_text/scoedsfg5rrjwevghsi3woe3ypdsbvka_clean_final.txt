This legislation was in troduced by Representative Gwen Moore (D-WI) on March 4, 2008. The resolution was referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor on March 4, 2008, but was never considered. H.Res. 1013 is expected to be considered on the floor of the House on March 5, 2008. SUMMARY H.Res. 1013 resolves that the House of Representatives:  Recognizes the importance of the National Scho ol Breakfast Program and its overall positive effect on the lives of low-income children and familie s, as well as its effect on helping to improve a child's overall classroom performance;  Expresses support for States that have successf ully implemented school breakfast programs in order to improve the test scores and gr ades of its participating students; and  Encourages states to strengthen their school breakfast programs by improving access for students, to promote improvements in the nutrition al quality of breakfasts served, and to inform students and parents of healthy nutritional and lifestyle choices. BACKGROUND The School Breakfast Program (SBP) was established in 1966 under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 as a two-year pilot project designed to provide categori cal grants to assist schools serving breakfasts to schools located in poor areas or in areas where childre n had to travel a great distance to school. During the first year of operation, the SBP served ab out 80,000 children at a federal cost of $573,000. In 2006, over 7.7 million students in the U.S. ate fr ee or reduced-price school breakfasts provided under the National School Breakfast Program established by section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. However, less than half of the low-in come students who participate in the National School Lunch Program also participate in the school breakfast program. Studies suggest that eating breakfast closer to classroom and test-taking time improves student performance on standardized tests relative to students who skip breakfast or have breakfast at home.
