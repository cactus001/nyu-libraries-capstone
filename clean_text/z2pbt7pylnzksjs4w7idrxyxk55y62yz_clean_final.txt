DPLU #421 (Rev. 11/04) OWNER-BUILDER INFORMATION Dear Property Owner: State law (Health and Safety Code, Secti ons 19830 and 19831) requires the County of San Diego to notify you that an application for a building permit has been submitted in your name, listing you as the builder of the specified proper ty improvements. For your protection, you should be aware that as "owner-builder" you are the responsible party of record on such a permit. Buildi ng permits are not required to be signed by property owners unless they ar e personally performing their own work. If your work is being performed by someone other than yourself, you may protect yourself from possible liability if that person applies for t he proper permit in his or her name. Contractors are required by law to be licens ed and bonded by the Stat e of California. They also are required by law to put thei r license number on all permits for which they apply. If you plan to do your own work, with the exception of various trades that you plan to subcontract, you should be aware of the fo llowing information for your benefit and protection. If you employ or otherwise engage any person ot her than your immediate family, and the work (including materials and other costs) is $500 or more for the enti re project, and such persons are not licensed as contractors or subcontractors in t he State of California, then you may be an employer. If you are an employer, you must r egister with the state and federal government as an employ er and you are subject to several obligations including state and federal income tax withholding, federal social security taxes, workers' compensation insurance, disability insur ance costs, and unemployment compensation contributions. There may be financial risks for you if you do not ca rry these obligations, and these risks are especially serious with res pect to workers' compensation insurance. For more specific information about your obligat ion under federal law, contact the Internal Revenue Service (telephone number: 1-800-829-1040) and if you wish the Small Business Administration (telephone number: (619) 557-7250). For more specific information about your obligations under state law, contact the Department of Indu strial Relations, Division of Workers' Compensation (telephone number: (619) 767-2086). If the structure is intended for sale, property owners who are not licens ed contractors are allowed to perform their work personally or through their own employees, without a licensed contractor or subcontra ctor, only under limited conditions. A frequent practice of unlicensed persons profe ssing to be contractors is to secure an "owner-builder" building permit, erroneously impl ying that the property owner is providing his or her own labor and materi als personally. There could be significant penalties for this practice.
