ESH Comments: Changing the HEPA filters required that the employe e lift each of the 5 fan/filter assemblies (weight = 50 lb. each) off of the clean room roof and then re-install the assemblies after the filters were replaced. No suitable mechanical l ifting device was available to hoist the assemblies. Plans are being developed to install mo norail-mounted hoists or similar equipment above the clean room to facilitate removal of the a ssemblies in the future. First aid treatment only. Medical limitations restrict the employee's ability to perform some routine duties, so case is DART.
