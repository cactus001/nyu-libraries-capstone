585 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission § 157.213 (4) The date of each agreement ob- tained pursuant to §157.206(b)(3) and the date construction began. [Order 436, 50 FR 42491, Oct. 18, 1985, as amended by Order 493, 53 FR 15030, Apr. 27, 1988; Order 603, 64 FR 26608, May 14, 1999; Order 603–B, 65 FR 11464, Mar. 3, 2000] § 157.212 Synthetic and liquefied nat- ural gas facilities. Subject to the notice requirements of §§157.205(b) and 157.208(c), the certifi-cate holder is authorized to acquire, construct, modify, replace, and operate natural gas facilities that are used to transport either a mix of synthetic and natural gas or exclusively revaporized liquefied natural gas and that are not ‘‘related jurisdictional natural gas fa-cilities’’ as defined in §153.2(e) of this chapter. The cost of a project may not exceed the cost limitation provided in column 2 of Table I in §157.208(d). The certificate holder must not segment projects in order to meet this cost limi-tation. [Order 686, 71 FR 63693, Oct. 31, 2006] § 157.213 Underground storage field fa- cilities. (a) Automatic authorization. If the project cost does not exceed the cost limitations provided in column 1 of Table I in §157.208(d), the certificate holder may acquire, construct, modify, replace, and operate facilities for the remediation and maintenance of an ex-isting underground storage facility, provided the storage facility’s certifi-cated physical parameters—including total inventory, reservoir pressure, res-ervoir and buffer boundaries, and cer-tificated capacity remain unchanged— and provided compliance with environ-mental and safety provisions is not af- fected. The certificate holder must not alter the function of any well that is drilled into or is active in the manage-ment of the storage facility. The cer-tificate holder must not segment projects in order to meet this cost limi-tation. (b) Prior Notice. Subject to the notice requirements of §§157.205(b) and 157.208(c), the certificate holder is au-thorized to acquire, construct, modify, replace, and operate natural gas under-ground storage facilities, provided the storage facility’s certificated physical parameters—including total inventory, reservoir pressure, reservoir and buffer boundaries, and certificated capacity, including injection and withdrawal ca-pacity, remain unchanged—and pro-vided compliance with environmental and safety provisions is not affected unchanged. The cost of a project may not exceed the cost limitation provided in column 2 of Table I in §157.208(d). The certificate holder must not seg-ment projects in order to meet this cost limitation. (c) Contents of request. In addition to the requirements of §§157.206(b) and 157.208(c), requests for activities au-thorized under paragraph (b) of this section must contain, to the extent necessary to demonstrate that the pro-posed project will not alter a storage reservoir’s total inventory, reservoir pressure, reservoir or buffer bound-aries, or certificated capacity, includ-ing injection and withdrawal capacity: (1) A description of the current geo- logical interpretation of the storage reservoir, including both the storage formation and the caprock, including summary analysis of any recent cross- sections, well logs, quantitative poros-ity and permeability data, and any other relevant data for both the stor-age reservoir and caprock; (2) The latest isopach and structural maps of the storage field, showing the storage reservoir boundary, as defined by fluid contacts or natural geological barriers; the protective buffer bound-ary; the surface and bottomhole loca-tions of the existing and proposed in-jection/withdrawal wells and observa-tion wells; and the lengths of open-hole sections of existing and proposed injec-tion/withdrawal wells; (3) Isobaric maps (data from the end of each injection and withdrawal cycle) for the last three injection/withdrawal seasons, which include all wells, both inside and outside the storage reservoir and within the buffer area; (4) A detailed description of present storage operations and how they may change as a result of the new facilities or modifications. Include a detailed discussion of all existing operational problems for the storage field, includ- ing but not limited to gas migration and gas loss; VerDate Aug<31>2005 09:46 Jun 01, 2007 Jkt 211057 PO 00000 Frm 00595 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\211057.XXX 211057

586 18 CFR Ch. I (4–1–07 Edition) § 157.214 (5) Current and proposed working gas volume, cushion gas volume, native gas volume, deliverability (at maximum and minimum pressure), maximum and minimum storage pressures, at the present certificated maximum capacity or pressure, with volumes and rates in MMcf and pressures in psia; (6) The latest field injection/with- drawal capability studies including curves at present and proposed working gas capacity, including average field back pressure curves and all other re-lated data; (7) The latest inventory verification study for the storage field, including methodology, data, and work papers; (8) The shut-in reservoir pressures (average) and cumulative gas-in-place (including native gas) at the beginning of each injection and withdrawal sea-son for the last 10 years; and (9) A detailed analysis, including data and work papers, to support the need for additional facilities (wells, gathering lines, headers, compression, dehydration, or other appurtenant fa-cilities) for the modification of work-ing gas/cushion gas ratio and/or to im-prove the capability of the storage field. [Order 686, 71 FR 63693, Oct. 31, 2006] § 157.214 Increase in storage capacity. (a) Prior notice. Subject to the notice requirements of §157.205, the certificate holder is authorized to increase the maximum volume of natural gas au-thorized to be stored in a storage field to the extent that geological data and operating experience have dem-onstrated that a volume of natural gas greater than that currently certifi-cated may be safely stored without the construction of additional facilities. (b) Contents of request. In addition to the requirements of §157.205(b), re-quests filed for activities described in paragraph (a) shall contain: (1) Current and requested maximum storage capacity; (2) Current and requested maximum storage pressure; (3) Average depth of the storage for- mation; (4) Copies of any geological or engi- neering studies that demonstrate the feasibility of the increase in storage volume; and (5) A statement setting forth the pur- pose of the proposed increased capac-ity. (c) Reporting requirements. For any storage facility whose capacity is in-creased pursuant to this section, the certificate holder shall submit, in the manner prescribed in §385.2011 of this chapter, semi-annual reports (to coin-cide with the termination of the injec-tion and withdrawal cycles) containing the information listed in subdivisions (1) through (8) of this paragraph. The certificate holder shall continue to file semi-annual reports until the storage inventory volume has reached, or closely approximates, the maximum specified in the request. Thereafter, the reports shall continue on a semi-an-nual basis for a period of one year. The filing of reports shall be discontinued thereafter unless otherwise ordered by the Commission. (Volumes shall be stated at 14.73 psia and 60 ° F, and pres- sures shall be stated in psia.) (1) The daily volume of natural gas injected into and withdrawn from the storage reservoir. (2) The volume of natural gas in the reservoir at the end of the reporting period. (3) The maximum daily injection or withdrawal rate experienced during the reporting period and the average work-ing pressure on such maximum days taken at a central measuring point where the total volume injected or withdrawn is measured. (4) Results of any tracer program by which the leakage of injected gas may be determined. If the leakage of gas ex-ists, the report should show the esti-mated total volume of gas leakage, the volume of recycled gas and the remain-ing inventory of gas in the reservoir at the end of the reporting period. (5) Any surveys of pressures in gas wells, water levels in observation wells, pump test results for the aquifer-type reservoirs, and the results of back-pres-sure tests conducted during the report-ing period. (6) The latest revised structure and isopachous contour maps showing the location of the wells, the location and extent of the gas bubble in the storage reservoir for aquifer-type reservoirs and in any other reservoirs of the project in which gas bubbles are known VerDate Aug<31>2005 09:46 Jun 01, 2007 Jkt 211057 PO 00000 Frm 00596 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\211057.XXX 211057
