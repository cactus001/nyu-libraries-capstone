This momentum is the result of glob al advocacy and inves tment paired with field-level da ta sharing and outre ach. Although the demand for da ta following the onset of the COVID-19 p andemic has pe aked, it remains strong. Our under standing of da ta availability and use c omes from managing the Humanit arian Da ta Exchang e (HD X), an open pla tform for finding and sharing da ta across crises and org aniz ations./one.sups The da ta on HD X reflects the re ality of the world’ s wors t humanit arian emerg encies, from persis tent displac ement to a lack of food and shelt er for vulner able popula tions. The da ta also shows the response to these crises, from who is providing wha t assis tance to funding levels and more. The UN es timates tha t 274 million people will need humanit arian assist ance and protection in 2022, at a co st of US$41 billion. In 2021, HD X was used by 1.4 million people in 236 c ountries and te rrito ries, maint aining the growth we saw in Org aniz ations added 2,071 new da tasets to the pla tform, bringing the total to almos t 18,500 da tasets, which were downloaded over 1.8 million times. Although HD X includes da ta about all c ountries in the world, we conc entr ate here on 27 loca tions with Humanit arian Response Plans (HRPs)./two.sups In 2021, 35 perc ent of all da tasets downlo aded from HD X were rel ated to an HRP loca tion./three.sups At the st art of 2022, we es timate tha t 69 perc ent of relev ant, c omple te crisis da ta is av ailable across 27 humanit arian oper ations, b ased on the analysis of the Da ta Grids. If we add the da ta tha t is relev ant but incomplet e, the tot al is 89 perc ent. This le aves 11 perc ent of ca tego ries with da ta tha t does no t meet the crit eria or with no da ta. The 27 Da ta Grids include 482 unique da tasets, with a r ang e of 12-22 da tasets per loca tion. https:// data.humda ta.org/ HRPs are prep ared by UN Humanit arian Countr y Te ams in loca tions where there is an ong oing humanit arian emerg enc y. HRPs are g ener ally prep ared annually , and outline an over all st rate gy and specific activities for e ach humanit arian clus ter or sec tor. We use Mixp anel, a third-p arty analytics ser vice, to under stand the behavior of users on the HD X plat form. We do no t send identifying informa tion to Mixp anel. 1 2 3/gid00004/gid00042/gid00040/gid00043/gid00039/gid00032 /gid00047/gid00032 /gid00010/gid00041/gid00030/gid00042/gid00040/gid00043/gid00039/gid00032 /gid00047/gid00032 /gid00015/gid00042/gid00001/gid00005/gid00028 /gid00047/gid00028 /gid00005/gid00028/gid00047/gid00028/gid00001/gid00030/gid00042/gid00040/gid00043/gid00039/gid00032/gid00047 /gid00032/gid00041/gid00032/gid00046/gid00046/gid01143Total Pe rcentage Data Complet e 69 %Total Pe rcentage Data Inc omplet e 20 %Total Pe rcentage No Data 11%20%11% 69% This report c ontains det ails on the da ta available for e ach loca tion, c atego ry and sub-c atego ry covered in the Da ta Grids as of 31 Dec ember 2021.

They pr ovide a c omp arable wa y to assess da ta availability across locations and categories and are the ba sis for the analysis in this report . The Da ta Grids include six categories: aﬀected people; c oordination and c ontex t; food security and nutrition; geogr aphy and infr astructure; he alth and education; and population and socio-ec onomy . (See Annex A for definitions.) Data may be included in a Da ta Grid if it is rele vant to the categ ory and sub-national. The da ta is c onsidered ‘comple te’ if it has br oad geogr aphic c overage, is shared in a c ommonly used forma t, and is up-t o-date. If any of those criteria are not me t, then it is c onsidered ‘inc omple te’. The sub-categ ory is c omple te if it includes at le ast one da taset that is comple te. If the sub-categ ory contains only inc omple te datasets, then that sub-categ ory is considered inc omple te. A sub-categ ory is empty if no da ta mee ts the above criteria or the da ta does not exist on HD X. (See Annex B for the Da ta Grid criteria and cur ation proc ess.) In 2021, HD X maint ained Da ta Grids f or 27 locations and 21 sub-categ ories. The 27 locations are c onsistent with 2020, but the number of sub-categ ories decr eased by six. Six were merg ed into three due to overlapping da tasets and three were removed due to a lack of r elevance across all locations. (See Annex C for chang es to the Da ta Grids.) We rec ognize the v aluable c ontributions of all da ta-sharing org aniz ations publishing da ta on HD X, and in particular the 20 org aniz ations tha t populate the Da ta Grids, with referenc e to 125 da ta sourc es.

6We hope tha t our analysis will incre ase awareness of the da ta available for humanit arian response activities and draw a ttention t o wha t is missing within a critical subset of da ta. Humanit arian crises are dynamic and so is the data needed t o under stand them. The HD X team will c ontinue t o be s trong da ta advoc ates and work in partnership with the dozens of org anizations c ontributing and using da ta on the pla tform. We look for ward to continued c ollabor ation and t o closing da ta gaps. KEY MESSAGES • Progress is being made in closing da ta gaps across mos t humanit arian oper ations. This momentum is the result of glob al advocacy and inves tment p aired with field-level da ta sharing and outre ach. • Although the demand for da ta following the onset of the C OVID-19 p andemic has pe aked, it remains s trong. In 2021, HD X was used by 1.4 million people in 236 c ountries and t errito ries. Around 1.8 million da tasets were downlo aded. • We es timate tha t 69 perc ent or over two- thirds of relev ant, c omple te crisis dat a is av ailable across 27 locations with humanit arian oper ations, b ased on the analysis of the HD X Dat a Grids. If we add the da ta tha t is relev ant but inc omplet e, the t otal is 89 perc ent. This le aves about 11 perc ent of the Dat a Grids with no da ta. • Af ghanis tan (86 perc ent) and CAR (86 perc ent) have the mos t complet e Dat a Grids. The nex t mos t comple te locations are Chad (81 perc ent), the Democr atic Republic of the Cong o (DRC) (81 perc ent), and Sudan (81 percent). • Venezuela (43 perc ent of the sub-c ategories with no da ta), Colombia (24 perc ent of the sub-c atego ries with no data) and Liby a (19 perc ent of the sub-c ategories with no da ta) are the c ountries with the lar gest data gaps. • Significant improvements were made with the av ailability of acut e malnutrition da ta (from 19 t o 73 perc ent complet e). This is due t o outre ach with local p artners by OCHA field oﬀic es. • Dat asets included in the D ata Grids are downlo aded almos t four times more than the aver age dataset on HD X. Ethiopia is the mos t popular loca tion and g eogr aphy and infr astructure is the mos t popular c atego ry (as measured by t otal da taset downlo ads). The t op five user loca tions were the Unit ed States, P akistan, the United King dom, E thiopia and Nig eria. • Humanit arian crises are dynamic and so is the da ta needed t o under stand them. The av ailability and complet eness of da ta will fluctu ate y ear-to-year as new da ta requirements c ome int o focus. Sinc e 2019, we have seen an incre ase in da ta complet eness from 54 perc ent t o 69 perc ent and the c atego ries with no da ta fall from 25 perc ent t o 11 perc ent (see chart below). • A priority for 2022 will be improving a ccess t o forecas t, obser vational and imp act da ta about haz ards and shocks. This will be essential t o exp anding anticipato ry action fr ameworks t o more c ountries with humanit arian oper ations. T o give momentum t o these eﬀorts, we will cre ate a new c atego ry in the HD X Dat a Grids.

OR GANIZATION DEEP DIVE: UNITED NATIONS POPULATION FUN D Popula tion sta tistics are the starting point for es tima ting the number of people aﬀect ed by a humanit arian crisis. As part of its reproductive he alth mission, UNFP A works to strengthen na tional popula tion da ta systems. Over the last sever al ye ars, UNFP A and OCHA have partnered to ensure th at sex and ag e disaggreg ated popula tion da ta is accessible to the humanit arian c ommunity , and we can see the progress by looking at HDX. The da ta collabor ation with UNFP A is focused on c ountries experiencing or at risk of a humanit arian crisis. F or these loca tions, OCHA oversees the c ommon oper ational da tasets (C ODs), which are authorit ative referenc e da ta used to support oper ations and decision-making in a humanit arian emerg enc y. The CO Ds include administ rative boundaries, which are p art of the g eogr aphy and infr astructure c atego ry of the HD X Da ta Grids, and popula tion statistics, which are p art of the popula tion and socio-ec onomy c atego ry. In 2021, UNFP A became the le ad ag ency for the C OD popula tion sta tistics da tasets. They combine demogr aphic expertise with working rela tionships with na tional sta tistical ag encies to identify , valida te, and if nec essary project the bes t available sta tistics. These da tasets are given a ‘referenc e ye ar’ referring to the ye ar for which the da ta was originally c ollect ed (normally a c ensus ye ar) or to which it has been projec ted. UNFP A beg an sharing C OD popula tion sta tistics on HD X in la te 2020. Over the past year, 50 da tasets have been added c overing 49 c ountries. Five of these da tasets are included in the Da ta Grids for Burundi, Chad, My anmar , Nigeria and Zimb abwe. The re st of UNFP A's current popula tion da tasets on HD X are for non-HRP loc ations tha t may be at risk of a humanit arian crisis. In 2022, UNFP A plans to upda te popula tion da tasets for sudden onset crises (as they did for T ong a following the rec ent volcanic erup tion ) and will c ontinue projecting the oldes t census da ta to the current ye ar.

DATA FOR MODELLING: ANTICIPATORY ACTION The Centre for Humanit arian Da ta centre.humda ta.org | Join our mailing lis t bit.ly/humd atamailing | T witter @humdat a | Email c entrehumd ata@un. org Anticipato ry action enables humanit arian org aniz ations to provide assis tance before a shock oc curs, reducing the imp act of a crisis on the lives of aﬀect ed people. Sinc e ea rly 2020, OCHA has been te sting the pr acticalities of anticipato ry action through pilo ts in 12 c ountries. Each pilo t has an anticipato ry action fr amework with three elements: a foreca st-based trigg er mechanism embedded in a decision-making proc ess (the model); a pre-agreed action plan (the deliver y); and pre-arr ang ed financ e (the mone y, in this case from the UN Centr al Emerg ency Response F und). The Centre’ s predictive analytics team has been supporting this work through the development of the trigg er mechanisms. A trigg er mechanism tr anslates the char acteristics of a haza rd or a shock and its impact (food insecurity or damag ed housing ) int o technical specifica tions. These specifica tions are the b asis for the action plan ’s preemp tive response. Trigg ers can include bo th obser vational da ta, such as w ater levels, and predictive elements, such as flood forecasts. A trigger is designed to provide partners with a window of opportunity to take action while b alancing the unc ertainty of the foreca sts. Designing a trigg er requires a ccess to three types of da ta: Current and his torical da ta about the haz ard; Da ta about the his torical and expect ed imp act of the ha zard and shock ; and Haz ard foreca st data. Despit e progress in filling da ta gaps in 2021, the av ailability and usability of this type of da ta remains a major barrier to implementing anticipato ry action in many humanit arian c ontexts. There has been suﬀicient da ta for the exis ting OCHA pilo ts but expanding antici pato ry action to new HRP loca tions will be challenging without improvements to the da ta landscape. Below we provide a closer look at the da ta needed for developing trigg ers based on our experienc e with sever al countries, including E thiopia, Malawi, Nep al and the Philippines. While we touch on the DRC and Moz ambique, the work to anticipate choler a is ong oing so we have no t included these co untries in the da ta availability ta ble. Haza rd Data Current and his torical da ta about a haz ard is required to model the lik elihood of the event oc curring. This da ta includes w eather and climate obser vations and dise ase sur veillanc e, as well as lis ts of re corded hi storical events, which are o/f_t en inc omple te or hard to access. In E thiopia, for example, despit e the number of ac tors producing early warning analysis for drought in the Horn of Africa, there is no c onsensus on the exact definition of wha t should be co nsidered a drought. As a result, there was no agreed-upon referenc e lis t of his torical drought ye ars, which was needed to establish a trigg er threshold and assess its performanc e. Similarly , in Malawi, there was no referenc e da taset to under stand the frequency and patt erns of dr y spells aﬀecting the southern region of the c ountr y, primarily due to a lack of c onsensus around the definition of the shock . To fill this ga p, we have analy zed and made av ailable on HD X over 20 ye ars of hi storical sub-na tional rainf all da ta to better under stand when and where dr y spells t ook plac e. The 12 pilo ts are: Bangladesh (floods), Burkina F aso (drought), Chad (drought), DRC (choler a), E thiopia (drought), Madag ascar (plague), Malawi (dry spells), Moz ambique (choler a), Nep al (floods), Nig er (drought), Somalia (drought), and The Philippines (typhoons). In this report we refer to ‘haz ard’ as the po tential sour ce of harm (e.g., a flood) which g ener ates a ‘shock ’ (e.g., w ater leve l above a c ertain threshold) tha t has an imp act on vulner able people (e.g., crop losses or housing des truction). To evaluate the trigg er we used historical rainfall da ta and f ood security da ta. The Ethiopia trigger has been independently ev aluat ed by the Red Cross Red Cresc ent Climate Centre https:// drive.g oogle.c om/file/ d/1gR1NrqO9v0k tvTiuwC3se SqPOfjX dxUC/view https:// data.humda ta.org /dataset/historical-dr y-spells-in-malawi18 1918 2019 20 21 21

22For anticipating choler a in the DRC and Moz ambique, it was challenging t o find da tasets lis ting all p ast outbre aks. When the da ta was av ailable, it was provided in multiple PDF reports, requiring significant eﬀort t o mak e it usable for analysis. Imp act Da ta Data linking previous shocks t o their imp act on vulner able popula tions is essential for the design of an anticip atory action trigg er. With this da ta in hand, it is possible t o model the expect ed imp act of a future shoc k. In the Philippines, his torical da ta on housing damag e from previous typhoons was founda tional for developing an impa ct model b ased on forecas ted typhoon tr acks. In Nep al, the lis t of his torical floods was es timated using data on w ater levels but it was diﬀicult t o estimate the severity of these events (i. e., the number of people aﬀect ed or the houses des troyed by the flood). In Malawi, OCHA c onduct ed a sur vey and inter views t o be tter under stand the imp act of p ast dry spells. Access t o imp act da ta is one of the main limit ations in implementing anticip atory action in c ountries with humanit arian oper ations. There are c onsis tent g aps in da ta on the imp act of haz ards on vulne rable popula tions. Even when this dat a is av ailable, it is unlik ely to be machine re adable, sub-na tional and/ or include relev ant geogr aphic c over age. These findings c orrespond with the c omplet eness levels of the aﬀec ted areas sub-ca tego ry in the Da ta Grids, where 10 out of the 27 HRP loca tions are missing da ta. Where this da ta does exis t, it may only r efer t o a rec ent shock (i. e., a flood in South Sudan ) or be p art of a bro ader severity analysis c onduct ed for the Humanit arian Needs Over view proc ess. Fo recast Data Current forecas t data is provided glob ally, with projections for riverine floods, s easonal r ainfall forecas ts, or major storms; or a t the regional and na tional level, with projections for specific c ountries or are as. In addition, his torical forecasts are used to better underst and model performan ce and the le ad time tha t these models c ould provide as part of an anticipato ry action plan. Accessing forecas t data in a machine-re adable forma t is a challeng e. In the Philippines, we relied on glob al da ta providers. In Nep al, na tional authorities provided qualit ative flood e arly warning informa tion, which had t o be extracted and tr anslated from social media and the Government’ s websi te. The challeng e can be even gr eate r when looking for his torical forecas t data. It is either no t available or has ver y limit ed geogr aphic or t empor al coverage. For Nep al, we found tha t national authorities did no t keep a rec ord of his torical flood forecas ts, which was needed t o evaluate the forecas ting skills and le ad time of the model.

23Improving A ccess to Haz ard Da ta The anticipato ry action pilo ts have demons trated the promise of getting ahe ad of crises before they escal ate by using diﬀerent analytical appro aches t o predict out -of-the-ordinar y events and their project ed imp act on vulner able people. This appro ach is enabled by the growing av ailability and quality of forecas t data as well as the incre asing awareness of humanit arian ac tors of the opportunities it provides. Access t o forecas t, obser vational and imp act da ta about haz ards and shocks will be essential t o exp anding anticipato ry action fr ameworks t o more c ountries with humanit arian oper ations. T o help humanit arian ac tors better assess the fe asibility of anticipato ry action in diﬀerent c ontexts, the Centre is de veloping a checklis t for trigg er mechanisms. This will include da ta requirements in addition t o other f actors such as local capacity and monit oring. Beyond antici pato ry action, more robus t weather and clima te data is needed t o under stand the ne ar and medium- term eﬀects of the clim ate crisis on humanit arian oper ations. Ac cess t o relev ant da ta and evidenc e about the humanit arian imp acts of clim ate chang e is k ey to helping e xtend the annual time horizon humanit arians typically focus on. To give momentum t o these eﬀorts, we will cr eate a new c ategory in the HD X Data Grids tha t includes the types of data det ailed above. We will also work with rese archers t o fill known d ata gaps by developing referenc e lists of historical haz ards and their imp act for priority c ountries. 23 https:// data.humdat a.or g/dashbo ards/ over view-of -dat a-grids23 The Centre for Humanit arian Da ta c entre.humda ta.org | Join our mailing lis t bit.ly/humd atamailing | T witter @humdat a | Email c entrehumd ata@un. org 11.

26The Centre for Humanit arian Da ta centre.humda ta.org | Join our mailing lis t bit.ly/humd atamailing | T witter @humdat a | Email c entrehumd ata@un. org ANNEX B: INCLUSION OF DATA IN THE DATA GRID S Data Grid cur ation involves the careful ev alua tion of da tasets on HD X for inclusion in one or more of the sub-c ateg ories in acco rdanc e with a st andard crit eria. The HD X team c onducts this ev alua tion when a da taset is newly added or upd ated on HD X. The HD X team supports the Da ta Grids in three ways: Reviewing whether any da taset on HD X could be added to a Da ta Grid; Conducting targeted outreach with humanit arian org aniz ations to find relev ant da tasets; and Identifying po tential da tasets with p artners in the rese arch c ommunity , academia and/ or g overnment ag encies. The fir st step in det ermining whether a da taset should be included in a Da ta Grid is to check whether the da taset meets this thema tic requirement defined in Annex A. Da tasets tha t are no t considered relev ant are aut oma tically excluded. The sec ond st ep is to det ermine if the da taset is sub-na tional. To fulfil this requirement the da ta mus t be disaggreg ated to at least the fir st adminis trative division. If the da ta is only av ailable at the na tional level, it is typically ex cluded. The sub-na tional requirement has been partially or c omplet ely waived for three da tasets: UNHCR’ s da ta on forcibly displac ed popula tions and stat eless persons; OCHA FT S’s requirements and funding data; and IA TI activities da ta. For informa tion about the decision-making proc ess for sub-na tional waivers, see Annex C.The third step is to assess whether a thema tically rele vant, sub-na tional da ta set is c omple te or inc omplet e. A dataset is c onsidered c omple te if it sa tisfies all of the following crit eria: Bro ad g eogr aphic c overage; Av ailable in c ommonly used forma ts; and Timely (full definitions are given below). If the da taset does no t satisfy one or more of these crit eria, it is c onsidered inc omplet e. Finally , the da taset is c omp ared ag ains t exis ting da tasets for tha t loca tion to determine if it should be added to the Da ta Grid. If the sub-c atego ry is emp ty, or if the da ta would c omplement o ther da tasets in a sub-c atego ry, the HDX team will add it to the Da ta Grid. A c omplement ary da taset is one tha t adds unique and useful informa tion to the sub-c atego ry. The IA TI da tasets are a g ood example of a c omplement ary da taset as they add unique and useful informa tion to the 3W sub-c atego ry. Ano ther example is a da taset tha t provides da ta for a geogr aphic ar ea not covered by the exis ting da taset. If there is alre ady a c omple te dataset av ailable for the sub-c atego ry, the HD X team will re ach out to in-c ountr y partners to det ermine which da taset is being used oper ationally and tha t da taset will be included in the Da ta Grid. The sub-c atego ry is considered c omple te if it has at least one c omple te dataset av ailable for the sub-c ateg ory. If the sub-c atego ry contains only inc omple te datasets, then tha t sub-c ateg ory is c onsidered inc omplet e. Over all catego ry complet eness refers to the proportion of sub-c atego ries in the c atego ry tha t are c omplet e. Similarly , complet eness for a loca tion refers to the proportion of sub-c atego ries tha t are c omple te in the loc ation. Sub-c ateg ories are c onsidered emp ty if no da tasets on HD X meet the above-mentioned crit eria. In g ener al, da ta can be missing for three re asons:

If the da taset is disaggreg ated by adminis trative divisions, does it c over all of them? If it does no t, is the me aning of a missing adminis trative division defined in the met ada ta? If there is no c omprehensive lis t to comp are ag ains t (for example, with spont aneous displac ement loca tions), does the da taset mak e it cle ar if it att emp ts to be c omprehensive or no t? • Are loca tion referenc es defined? The da taset should c ontain explicit g eogr aphic da ta (i.e., Geogr aphic Informa tion Sys tem da ta or t abular da ta with la titude and longitude fields). If no t, the da taset should be joinable to an av ailable da taset tha t defines those loca tions. Is the da ta in c ommonly-used forma ts? • Is it st ored in a c ommon file forma t? We include CS V, XLS, XL SX, SHP , GEO JSON, et c. Fo rmat s lik e GPK G and o thers tha t are more diﬀicult for the typical humanit arian da ta specialis t would be mark ed ‘inc omple te’. • Is the da ta tidy? Field names and da ta rows should be e asy to det ermine. There should no t be sub -total rows int erspersed with da ta rows. The required da ta for the ca tego ry should be in a single t able on the same ta b. For t abular da ta with c oordin ates, the x and y c olumns (usually longitude and la titude) should be in decimal degree forma t and sep arated int o two columns. Is the da ta timely? • Has the da taset bec ome out of date ? Depending on how frequently the da taset is expect ed to be updated, the HD X team c onsiders the ag e of the da ta and whether the da taset should have been superseded.

We es tablished an int ernal Da ta Grid Governanc e Group to discuss feedb ack and improvements and mak e decisions around chang es to the Da ta Grids. In 2021, the Da ta Grid Governanc e Group met three times and approved the following chang es: Crowdsourc ed da ta may be c onsidered c omple te on a case-by-case b asis. Previously , all crowdsourc ed da tasets were aut oma tically c onsidered inc omple te because this da ta collection methodolog y mak es it diﬀicult to det ermine how up -to-date and c omprehensive the da ta is. The Da ta Grid Governanc e Group det ermined tha t crowdsourc ed da ta would be c onsidered c omple te if an OCHA field oﬀic e confirms tha t the da ta is the bes t available and is being used oper ationally . HD X Connect da tasets can be included in the Da ta Grids and c onsidered c omple te if they have been reviewed by the HD X te am. HDX Connect is a f eature tha t enables org aniz ations to share met ada ta only and mak e the underlying da ta available by reques t. This ensur es tha t org aniz ations can verify who can ac cess the da ta in sensitive c ontexts. The Data Grid Governanc e Group det ermined tha t as long as the HD X team has reviewed the da taset and assessed it agains t the crit eria for inclusion in the Da ta Grids, tha t da ta can be c onsidered c omple te. Sub-c ateg ories were merg ed or removed. The Da ta Grid Governanc e Group reviewed all sub-c atego ries and the da ta within them, and agreed to the following chang es: a. The humanit arian profile loca tions sub-c atego ry was merg ed int o the int ernally displac ed persons sub-c atego ry and the definition was upd ated to enc omp ass elements of bo th. b. The baseline population by sex and age was merged into the baseline population sub -catego ry and the definition was upd ated to require sex and ag e dissaggrega tion. c. GAM and SAM were merg ed int o a new acut e malnutrition sub-c atego ry. This new sub-c ateg ory can be sa tisfied with da ta specifying either GAM or SAM rates. d. The sub-c ateg ories for casualties, aﬀect ed schools, and damag ed and des troyed buildings were removed due to a lack of relev ance across all loca tions. They were therefore no t a c onsis tent me asure for humanit arian da ta availability . W aiver of sub-na tional requirement for inclusion in the Da ta Grid. The UNHCR da ta on forcibly displac ed popula tions and stat eless persons was previously ex cluded from the refug ees and persons of c onc ern sub-c atego ry because it was no t sub-na tional. We rec eived feedb ack tha t because refug ee sta tus is b ased on crossing na tional borders, refug ee sta tistics are typically av ailable and used at the na tional ra ther than sub-na tional level. The Da ta Grid Governanc e Group de termined tha t this da ta is the bes t available and gr anted a waiver to include it as c omple te for the sub-categ ory. A similar sub-na tional waiver is in plac e for the OCHA FT S requirements and funding da ta, sinc e it is co nsidered the bes t available, and for the IA TI aid activities da tasets, which are assessed as inc omple te but c onsidered a c ompliment ary da taset to the 3W . Cr eation of a ‘No t Applicable’ assessment . The Da ta Grid Governanc e Group agreed to allow ‘No t Applicable’ to be used when the sub-c ateg ory is no t relev ant in a given c ontext. This w as applied to the following loca tions and sub-c ateg ories: Ukr aine - acut e malnutrition; Ukr aine - refug ees and persons of c onc ern; Ukr aine - returnees; and Stat e of P ales tine - returnees.
