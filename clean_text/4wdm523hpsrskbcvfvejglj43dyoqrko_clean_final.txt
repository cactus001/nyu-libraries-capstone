HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE CHARGE THAT OUR CUBA POLICY IS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED? A: OUR POLICY TOWARD CUBA IS TO ENCOURAGE A RAPID, PEACEFUL TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY.

THE COMMISSION,S RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED. Q. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO CHARGES THAT THE POLICY IS TOO HARSH AND HAS ALIENATED CUBAN-AMERICANS? A: THE CHANGES IN LICENSING RULES ARE DESIGNED TO LIMIT THE FLOW OF U.S. DOLLARS TO THE CASTRO REGIME AND ARE NOT DIRECTED SOLELY AT CUBAN-AMERICANS. THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED CHANGES THAT INCLUDED TIGHTENING UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED OF RESTRICTIONS ON EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES IN CUBA, AS WELL AS LIMITING FAMILY TRAVEL.

Q. WHAT RULES ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE REGARDING FOOD, MEDICINE AND TOILETRIES TO CUBA? A: THE COMMISSION DETERMINED THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT EARNED TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY BY CHARGING DELIVERY FEES TO RECIPIENTS OF GIFT PARCELS. RECOGNIZING THAT GIFT PARCELS MEET A FUNDAMENTAL HUMANITARIAN NEED IN CUBA, THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED THAT GIFT PARCELS BE LIMITED TO FOOD, MEDICINES, MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND DEVICES, RADIOS AND BATTERIES. THIS RECOMMENDATION HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON GIFT PARCELS, I SUGGEST THAT YOU CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE. Q. IS THERE A REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION UNDERWAY? A: THE NEW TREASURY DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS WERE OPEN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THROUGH AUGUST 15.

A: THE COMMISSION FOR ASSISTANCE TO A FREE CUBA RECOMMENDED TO THE PRESIDENT THAT AIRBORNE TRANSMISSIONS OF RADIO AND TV MARTI BROADCASTING BE CARRIED OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS TO BREAK THE CUBAN REGIME'S INFORMATION BLOCKADE ON THE CUBAN PEOPLE.

UNCLASSIFIED BUILDING ON THE EFFORTS OF CUBAN CIVIL SOCIETY, THESE TYPES OF BROADCASTS WILL INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY TO THE CUBAN PEOPLE OF RELIABLE INFORMATION ON EVENTS IN CUBA AND AROUND THE WORLD. Q: DID THE BROADCAST INTERFERE WITH PRIVATE U.S. BROADCASTING? A: THE AIRBORNE BROADCAST OF TV MARTI WAS UNDERTAKEN ON A FREQUENCY ALREADY AUTHORIZED BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION FOR TV MARTI BROADCASTS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT RADIO MARTI WAS BROADCAST ON A FREQUENCY NOT USED BY U.S. COMMERCIAL BROADCASTERS. THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION IS TAKING STEPS TO MINIMIZE POTENTIAL TV MARTI INTERFERENCE WITH DOMESTIC STATIONS BY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE BROADCASTS ON DOMESTIC LICENSEES. Q: IS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE HOSTILE ACTION AGAINST U.S. PERSONNEL IN RESPONSE TO THE BROADCASTS? WHAT WOULD THE RESPONSE TO SUCH AN ACT BE? A: FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR PEOPLE AND OPERATIONAL SECURITY, WE DO NOT DISCUSS OPERATIONAL MATTERS IN DETAIL. HOWEVER, PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MINIMIZE THE THREATS TO U.S. PERSONNEL FROM CUBAN FIGHTER AIRCRAFT INTERCEPTS OR OTHER DIRECT THREATS AGAINST THE AIRCRAFT. THESE BROADCASTS WERE MADE ONLY IN U.S. AIRSPACE. ANY ATTEMPT TO INTERCEPT THE AIRCRAFT WOULD BE TREATED AS A HOSTILE ACT AND APPROPRIATE SELF-DEFENSE MEASURES WOULD BE TAKEN. Q: CASTRO HAS LONG CLAIMED THAT THE U.S. INTENDS TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION AGAINST CUBA. IS THIS THE FIRST STEP IN THAT PROCESS? A: THE POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO HASTEN A PEACEFUL TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY IN CUBA. THAT POLICY HAS BEEN ARTICULATED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF OUR GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING BY SECRETARY POWELL. TV MARTI HAS TRANSMITTED ITS SIGNAL TO CUBA FOR OVER A DECADE, AND ITS SIGNAL IS ROUTINELY JAMMED BY THE REGIME. OUR HOPE IS THAT THESE BROADCASTS WILL ENABLE THE CUBAN PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO UNCENSORED INFORMATION ABOUT CUBA AND THE WORLD. UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED Q: HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY PROTESTS FROM THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT CONCERNING THESE BROADCASTS? A: THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HAS COMPLAINED ABOUT RADIO AND TV MARTI BROADCASTS SINCE THEIR INCEPTION. WE HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE REGIME WILL CONTINUE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT OUR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE DETAILED AND ACCURATE INFORMATION TO THE CUBAN PEOPLE ABOUT EVENTS OUTSIDE OF CUBA. IT IS OUR POSITION THAT THE MORE CUBANS KNOW ABOUT THE WORLD -- AND THE WORLD KNOWS THE TRUTH ABOUT CUBA -- THE BETTER THE CHANCES OF A RAPID AND PEACEFUL TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY, WHICH IS THE CENTRAL GOAL OF THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES IN EUROPE AND LATIN AMERICA.
