To a bill amending one section of existing law to accomplish a par-not precisely contemplated by existing law.Accordingly, the Chair sustains the point of order. E. RELATION OF AMENDMENT OR BILL TO EXISTING LAW §35. Amendments to Bills Which Amend Existing Law It has been held that the rule of germaneness applies to the rela- tionship between a proposed amendment and the pending bill to which offered and not to the re- lation between such amendment and an existing title of the United States Code which the pending bill seeks to amend,(15)except where the bill is a continuation or re-enactment of existing law, in which case amendments seeking to modify the law being extended in a germane manner may be ger- mane to the bill,(16)or where the bill so comprehensively or di- versely amends an existing law as to permit amendments which are germane to other provisions of that law.(17)Thus, the germane- ness of an amendment that pro- poses to change existing law may depend on the extent to which the bill itself seeks to change the law. A bill comprehensively amendingseveral sections of existing law may be sufficiently broad in scope to admit as germane an amend- ment which is germane to another section of that law not amended by the bill.(18)But where a bill amends existing law in one nar- row particular, an amendment proposing to modify such existing law in other particulars will gen- erally be ruled out as not ger- mane.(19)As an example, if a bill seeks only to modify the penalty provisions of a law proscribing specified conduct, an amendment will not be germane if it seeks to broaden the scope or alter the ap- plicability of such law.(20)It is generally held, therefore, that, to a bill amending existing law in one particular, an amendment proposing to modify an unrelated section of the law(1)or relating to terms of that law that are not re- ferred to in the bill(2)is not ger- VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01436 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

8817AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 ticular purpose, an amendment pro- posing changes in another section of that law in a manner not within the terms of the bill is not germane. See Sec. 41.14, infra. See §§ 35.6, 35.77, 39.12, 39.13, infra. See §§ 35.80, 35.91, 41.1, 41.2, infra. See § 42.43, infra. See the ruling of Chairman Warren G. Magnuson (Wash.) at 89 C ONG.REC. 1158, 78th Cong. 1st Sess., Feb. 19, 1943. Under consideration was H.R. 1605 (Committee on Agri- culture), comprising an amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. The bill is discussed more fully in § 35.2, infra. See § 35.70, infra. See §§ 35.19, 42.7, infra. See § 35.71, infra. See § 35.49, infra. See § 35.8, infra.mane. It may be said, then, that, to a bill amending one section of an existing law, an amendment proposing further modification of the law, as by amending another section of that law, is usually not germane.(3) Similarly, if a bill amends exist- ing law in several respects, but re- lates to a single subject or has a single purpose, an amendment is not germane that proposes to modify the law further in a man- ner not related to the purpose of the bill.(4) To a bill amending existing law in a limited respect, an amend- ment repealing the law is not ger- mane. Accordingly, to a bill estab- lishing a new office within a gov- ernment department, an amend- ment to abolish the department is not germane.(5) The rule may be broadly stated that, to a bill proposing solely to amend one subtitle of an act, an amendment is not germane which would have the effect of repealing or amending other sections of the act that are not within the pur- view of the bill.(6)It has been held that where an amendment to a bill proposes modification of a section of exist- ing law in some respects, an amendment to the amendment may properly propose modification of the same section of the law in other respects.(7)Thus, it is held that, to a substitute amendment modifying a section of existing law, an amendment further modi- fying that section may be ger- mane.(8) Similarly, to an amendment in the nature of a substitute, amend- ing several sections of an existing law, an amendment proposing fur- ther modification of one of the sec- tions sought to be amended has been held to be germane.(9) Where a bill amends existing law in two unrelated respects, an amendment proposing a third modification may be germane.(10) To a bill amending two sections of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, an amendment proposing a change in a third section of the act was held germane.(11) VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01437 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

See the proceedings of July 31, 1990, relating to H.R. 1180, the Housing and Community Development Act, discussed in § 4.58, supra.To a bill re-enacting an existing law in modified form, an amend- ment proposing further modifica- tion of that law may be ger- mane.(12)And where a bill nar- rowly amends only one section of existing law, but is broadened by amendment to alter another sec- tion of the law, a further amend- ment to change still other sections of the law may be germane.(13) But it should be noted that a bill amending several sections of one title of the United States Code does not necessarily bring the entire title under consider- ation so as to permit an amend- ment to any portion thereof.(14) Even where a bill amends an act in several particulars, an amend- ment proposing further modifica- tion of the act in respects not re- lated to the subject of the bill is not germane.(15)Thus, it has been held that, to a bill amending an act in two particulars, an amend- ment offered to amend the act in a third particular but in a manner not related to the bill is not ger- mane.(16) The question for the Chair in such cases is whether the bill amending existing law is of such ageneral or diverse nature as to fundamentally change the law in- volved, and thereby open the law generally to amendments.(17) Where the proposition under consideration was to amend the Defense Production Act of 1950, an amendment proposing to add provisions to such act, ``notwith- standing any other provision of this or any other law,'' was ruled out of order as an attempt to amend other laws not under con- sideration.(18) Of course, an amendment must be germane to that title or portion of the bill to which offered.(19) Thus, the test of germaneness to a pending title of a bill is the rela- tionship of the amendment to that title or to the law being amended by that title, and not to other por- tions of the bill not then pending for amendment.(20) But in some instances, due to the scope and nature of the sub- ject matter of a title of the bill sought to be amended, amend- VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01438 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

[H AMPTON P.] F ULMER [of South Carolina]: I do not believe [the amend- ment] is in line with the real purpose of the bill, and it goes much further than we intended under the bill, so it is not germane to the bill. In support of the point of order, Mr. Clifford R. Hope, of Kansas, stated: Mr. Chairman, I call attention of the Chair to the fact that section 376, which is sought to be amended, deals with one subject, and one onlyÐthe ju- risdiction of the courts in the enforce- ment of the penalty provisions of the act. The provision in the bill under consideration, while an amendment to part II of subtitle C, does not in any way go to the enforcement of the act, through the courts or otherwise, but simply provides for a different method of making allotments to individual farms in the case of the basic commod- ities except wheat, and for making al- lotments to the counties and States in the case of wheat. It is a new section and does not touch anything at all under this subtitle except the method and procedure of making allotments.

The Chairman(10)in ruling on the point of order, stated: The Chair is ready to rule and inter- prets the amendment of the gentleman from Maryland to involve the question of jurisdiction and enforcement of ju- risdiction for the whole act. His amendment provides that such juris- diction shall in no case be exercised as to any crop. The bill before the Com- mittee restricts itself to certain crops. The amendment of the gentleman from Maryland would in effect suspend ju- risdiction to enforcing the entire Agri- cultural Adjustment Act, because it would do away with the machinery for such suspension, and, therefore, the Chair is inclined to rule that the amendment is too far reaching, and goes beyond the scope of the bill and is not germane, and the Chair sustains the point of order. Agricultural Price SupportsÐ Amendment Adding Com- modity to Those Covered §35.3 To a bill amending a law dealing with several subjects within a definable class, an amendment further amend- ing that law to add another subject within the same class is germane; thus, to a bill temporarily amending for one year an existing law es- tablishing price support lev-els for several agricultural commodities, an amendment adding another agricultural commodity to be covered by the same provisions of law for that year was held ger- mane. During consideration of H.R. 4296 (a bill concerning emergency price supports for 1975 crops) in the Committee of the Whole, the Chair overruled a point of order in the circumstances described above. The language of the bill to which the amendment was offered read as follows:(11) Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That title I of the Agri- cultural Act of 1949, as amended, is amended by adding at the end there- of the following new section 108: ``Sec. 108.

The Clerk read as follows: Committee amendment: , line 15, after the word ``cooperator'' strike the period and insert ``, except that for the 1975 crops of upland cot- ton, feed grains and wheat, the Sec- retary shall establish, insofar as is practicable, the same terms and con- ditions relative to storage costs and interest rates on all nonrecourse loans extended on such crops.''. THECHAIRMAN : The question is on the committee amendment. The committee amendment was agreed to. During the proceedings of Mar. 20, 1975,(13)the following amend- ment was offered: MR. [SILVIO O.] C ONTE [of Massachu- setts]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Conte: , after line 25, add this new section:``(c) Notwithstanding the provi- sions of section 301 of this Act or common sense, the Secretary shall make available to producers loans and purchases on the 1975 crop of fruit nuts at such levels as reflect the historical average relationship of fruit nut support levels to dingleberry support levels during the immediately preceding one hundred and ninety-nine years''. ... MR. [T HOMAS S.] F OLEY [of Wash- ington]: Mr. Chairman, the chairman of the committee finds it necessary to insist on his point of order. I know the gentleman who has of- fered the amendment is a strong sup- porter of fruit nuts and is in great seri- ousness in an effort to improve the bill, but the reference in the amendment is to a standard which cannot be admin- istered because the country was not or- ganized, the Congress was not orga- nized at the time he alleges in the amendment the Dingleberry support price was created. But principally be- cause under rule XVI, clause 7, the fundamental purpose of this amend- ment does not relate to the funda- mental purpose of the bill, which is to effect changes in the target prices of loan rates on wheat, feed grain, and cotton. The nuttiness of an amendment has never been found in the precedents of the House as an argument against ger- maneness. ... MR. C ONTE : ... I feel that this amendment is germane in the context of this bill. The whole bill is nutty, and I am merely institutionalizing what the American people have known all along, that farm subsidies do not grow on trees. THECHAIRMAN : The Chair is pre- pared to rule.

Cooley [N.C.]). John J. Rooney (N.Y.). H.J. Res. 247 (Committee on Agri- culture).The Chair would observe that the purpose of this bill as set forth in the report is to establish an emergency price support program in the 1975 crop commodity year for upland cotton, wheat, feed grains, soybeans, and milk. Under the general proposition that it is in order to add another subject to a proposition containing subjects of the same class, the Chair would point out that the amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts adds another agri- cultural commodity to the commodities proposed to be supported under the bill during the same period of time. The Chair rules, therefore, that the gentleman's amendment is germane and overrules the point of order. Bill Striking Provisions and Inserting LanguageÐAmend- ment Adding Language With- out Striking Provisions §35.4 To a bill striking out a section of existing law and inserting new language, an amendment adding the new language at the end of the section of law being amend- ed, rather than striking out the section and inserting new language, is germane. In the 88th Congress, a bill(14) relating to the cotton industry was under consideration. A provi- sion in such bill sought to amend the Agricultural Act of 1949 by striking out a section of that lawpertaining to corn price supports and inserting in lieu thereof lan- guage creating a new cotton pro- gram. An amendment was of- fered(15)which sought to add the provisions as to the new cotton program at the end of the section of existing law, thereby leaving the existing section of law per- taining to the corn program in- tact. Mr. John H. Kyl, of Iowa, made the point of order that the amendment was not germane; the Chairman,(16)however, having al- ready stated that, ``The purpose of this amendment is to correct the technical references,'' ruled with- out further elaboration that the amendment was germane. Amendment Affecting Different Section of Existing Law §35.5 To a joint resolution to amend a specific section of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 relating to the national allotment for cotton, an amendment affecting an- other section of that act re- lating to allotment of acreage was held to be not germane.

A point of order was raised against the amendment, as fol- lows: MR. [M ARVIN ] JONES [of Texas]: Mr. Speaker, I desire to make a point of order against the amendment, that it is not germane. This resolution deals with section 343 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and this amendment has to do with section 344 of the State allotments. The Speaker,(18)in sustaining the point of order, stated: ... The Chair has considered the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina and finds upon acareful reading of the amendment that it does not relate to the section of the act that the resolution under consider- ation seeks to amend and, therefore, cannot possibly be in order.(19) Bill Affecting Amounts Avail- able for Assistance to Pro- ducers of Certain Commod- itiesÐAmendment Modifying Portion of Law Addressing Requirements for Eligibility for Funds §35.6 To a bill to amend a sec- tion of existing law with re- spect to amounts available for assistance to producers of certain commodities, an amendment to modify an- other section of that law with respect to substantive requirements for eligibility for funds under the law was held to be not germane.

Mr. Henry B. Steagall, of Ala- bama, made the point of order that the amendment was not ger- mane to the bill. The Chairman,(2) sustaining the point of order, stat- ed: The bill now under consideration seeks to amend section 4, which deals with the amount only. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Mis- souri seeks to add a proposition which might be germane to the original act but which seems to the Chair not to be related to the section of the act here sought to be amended by the pending bill. Surplus Agricultural Products for NeedyÐAmendment Pro- viding for Food Stamp Plan §35.7 To a bill to amend the act authorizing the Com- modity Credit Corporation to make surplus agricultural products available for needy persons in the United States, an amendment providing a new and comprehensive food stamp plan for the distribu- tion of surplus products was held to be germane.In the 86th Congress, during consideration of a bill(3)to amend the Agricultural Trade Develop- ment and Assistance Act of 1954, an amendment was offered pro- viding in part:(4) Amendment offered by Mrs. Sul- livan: . .. insert the following new section 14 . ..: Sec. 14.

H.R. 8609 contains no such provision to which this pro- posed amendment is germane. In addition, the proposed amend- ment would suspend the operation of section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, which is not before us. The bill, H.R. 8609, contains only one reference to section 416, but this provision deals only with the labeling of surplus foods, not with the system of distributing these commodities. ... In defense of the amendment, the proponent, Mrs. Leonor Kretzer Sullivan, of Missouri, stated as follows: ... H.R. 8609 is a bill to amend the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. ... The Agri- cultural Trade Development and As- sistance Act of 1954 . .. contains pro- visions . .. authorizing domestic dona- tions of surplus food to our own needy. This is contained in titles II and III of the law. The bill before us amends title II and III in several respects. The bill be- fore us furthermore contains language clearly applicable to the domestic dis- tribution of surplus foods. ... I make one further point in con- testing the point of order. Cannon's Precedents, volume VIII, section 2941, states: An act continuing and reenacting an existing law is subject to amend- ment modifying the provisions of the law carried in the act. ... The Chairman(6)agreed with the contentions of Mrs. Sullivanand overruled the point of order, also citing the following statement of the Chair in a prior similar rul- ing: The act which the bill proposes to amend and extend contains a provision relating to the subject matter and, as pointed out, is sufficiently broad and does cover the material offered in this amendment. ... Formula for State Participa- tion in Food Stamp Pro- gramÐAmendment Affecting Qualifications of Recipients §35.8 To a bill authorizing funds for the food stamp pro- gram for the next fiscal year and changing the formula for state participation in the program, an amendment re- lating to the qualifications for recipients of aid under the program was held to be germane. In the 90th Congress, during consideration of a bill(7)amending two sections of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, the following amend- ment was offered, affecting a third section:(8) Amendment offered by Mr. [William F.] Ryan [of New York]: Add the fol- lowing new section at the end of the bill: VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01448 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

A point of order was raised against the amendment, as fol- lows:(9) MR. [W ILLIAM R.] P OAGE [of Texas]: Mr. Chairman, I make the point of order against the amendment that it is not ger- mane to the purposes or objectives of this bill, that it does not amend any of the sections covered by this bill or the sub- ject matter touched on by this bill. This bill relates only to sections 15 and 16. The amendment offered by the gentleman from New York relates to section 5 of the Food Stamp Act. The Chairman,(10)in ruling on the point of order, stated: The bill, which has been amended, amends two sections of existing law. The proposed amendment to add an- other section to the pending bill would amend a third section of existing law. The Chair rules, therefore, that the amendment is germane.Provisions Relating to Impor- tation of Farm WorkersÐPen- alties for Noncompliance With Provisions of Bill §35.9 To a bill to amend the Agricultural Act of 1949 to authorize the Secretary of Labor to recruit and make certain provisions for agri- cultural workers from Mex- ico, an amendment pro- viding, in one part, penalties for employing any Mexican alien not duly admitted ``under the terms of this act or any other law'' was held to be not germane. In the 82d Congress, a bill(11) was under consideration which provided in part as follows:(12) Be it enacted, etc., That the Agricul- tural Act of 1949 is amended by adding at the end thereof a new title to read as follows: TITLE VÐA GRICULTURAL WORKERS Sec. 501.

The following amendment was offered:(13) Amendment offered by Mr. Polk in the nature of a substitute for H.R. 3283: That the Agriculture Act of 1949 is amended by adding at the end there- of a new title to read as follows: TITLE VÐA GRICULTURAL WORKERS Sec. 509. Any person who shall employ any Mexican alien . .. not lawfully entitled to enter . .. the United States under the terms of this act or any other law relating to the immigration or expulsion of aliens when such person . .. has reasonable grounds to believe . .. that such alien is not lawfully within the United States . .. shall be guilty of a felony. ... A point of order was raised against the amendment, as fol- lows:(14) MR. [H ARRIS ] E LLSWORTH [of Or- egon]: . .. Section 509 of the proposed substitute deals only with the matter of finding information as to the illegal entry of alien Mexicans into the United States, and imposes a penalty for fail- ure to supply information concerning such illegal entry. That is the sole pur- pose and the sole effect of this section It does not refer to the employ- ment of farm labor, and it does not go to the purpose of the bill.Mr. Harold D. Cooley, of North Carolina, in support of the point of order, stated:(15) Mr. Chairman, I would like to call attention to the fact that if section 509 had been introduced as a separate bill, it would not even have been referred to the Committee on Agriculture. It would have gone to the Immigration Committee. In defense of the amendment, the proponent stated as follows: MR. [J AMES G.] P OLK [of Ohio]: Mr. Chairman, I call attention to the fact that this bill amends the Social Secu- rity Act, and I am speaking now on the bill before the House, H.R. 3283. It also amends the Immigration Act of 1917, and I refer to lines 7, 8, 9, and 10, on page 5. It amends the Internal Revenue Code, and I refer to lines 2, 3 and 4, at the top of page 5. In other words, in several instances the bill which is before the House amends other Federal statutes. The Chairman,(16)in ruling on the point of order, stated: As the Chair understands the rule of germaneness, its purpose is to provide for and protect the orderly procedure in the Committee of the Whole and in the House. It is to protect the legisla- tive processes, to protect the member- ship from hasty, ill-considered, and ex- traneous subject matter being offered to the proposition under consideration.

The Chair does not feel that the provision of a penalty or the provi- sion for civil relief from a law seeking to be enacted would be a matter unakin or unrelated to the bill. How- ever, there is specific matter in the amendment, to wit, ``or any other law relating to the immigration [or] expul- sion of aliens'' which is to be found in section 509 to which specific objection was made. The Chair has examined the bill before the Committee and is unable to find reference to any other law relating to the immigration or ex- pulsion of aliens. Therefore, because of the references just cited, the Chair sustains the point of order.(17) §35.10 To a proposition relat- ing to the recruitment of farm laborers from Mexico, an amendment imposing pen- alties on any person employ- ing Mexican labor not law- fully entitled to enter ``under the terms of this act'' was held to be germane. In the 82d Congress, during consideration of a proposition re- lating to the recruitment of farm laborers from Mexico,(18)the fol-lowing amendment was of- fered:(19) Amendment offered by Mr. Celler to the amendment offered by Mr. Polk: Add a new section as follows: Sec. Ð. Any person who shall em- ploy as a farm laborer any Mexican alien . .. not lawfully entitled to enter . .. the United States under the terms of this act, when such per- son . .. has reasonable grounds to believe . .. that such alien farm la- borer is not lawfully within the United States . .. shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by imprison- ment. ... Mr. Harold D. Cooley, of North Carolina, made the point of order that the amendment was not ger- mane to the amendment under consideration. Mr. Emanuel Celler, of New York, in support of his amendment, stated:(20) ... This is a bill concerning the op- erations of alien labor, what they shall do and what they shall not do, under the terms and conditions that they may or may not come over the border, and my amendment certainly is con- sistent with the purposes and aims of the bill in general. A penalty for viola- tion of the terms laid down is germane.

Gore (Tenn.).The Committee has before it a bill to which the gentleman from Ohio has of- fered an amendment, to which, in turn, the gentleman from New York has of- fered an amendment providing specific penalties for violation of the provisions of the bill when written into law. The rule of germaneness has been inter- preted rather narrowly, but the Chair does not feel that it can declare or hold that the provision of a penalty for the violation of the provisions of the bill is new subject matter or unrelated sub- ject matter. Therefore, the point of order is over- ruled.(2) ÐAmendment Relating to De- tention of Aliens and Affect- ing Prior Appropriations §35.11 To a bill amending the Agricultural Act of 1949 to permit importation of Mexi- can agricultural workers, an amendment relating to the detention of Mexican aliens generally in the United States and providing that prior appropriations be available to carry out the purposes of the provision was held to be not germane. In the 82d Congress, during consideration of a bill(3)relatingto importation of Mexican agricul- tural workers, the following amendment was offered:(4) Amendment offered by Mr. [Eman- uel] Celler [of New York]: Add a new section: Sec. 512. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary and without regard to section 3709 of the revised statutes, the Attorney General is authorized to purchase, construct . .. and maintain . .. such detention facilities as may be necessary for the apprehension and removal to Mexico of Mexican aliens illegally in the United States. Appro- priations made to the Immigration and Naturalization Service shall be available for expenditures to carry out the purposes of this act. A point of order was raised against the amendment, as fol- lows:(5) MR. [H AROLD D.] C OOLEY [of North Carolina]: [The amendment] broadens the scope of the legislation under con- sideration. It is not germane, and it ac- tually constitutes an appropriation. The Chairman,(6)in ruling on the point of order, stated: ... As the Chair understands the bill before the committee, H.R. 3283, it applies to certain Mexican aliens as a class and as described in the bill.

The amendment also proposes to appropriate funds for a certain purpose described in the amendment. For these two reasons, the Chair is constrained to sustain the point of order. ÐAmendment Affecting Labor Standards Under Different Act §35.12 To a bill amending the Agricultural Act of 1949 to permit importation of Mexi- can agricultural workers, an amendment providing that notwithstanding the provi- sions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, ``the Sec- retary of Labor is empow- ered to authorize . .. the employment in agriculture of employees under the age of 16 years,'' was held to be not germane. In the 82d Congress, during consideration of a bill(7)relating to importation of Mexican agricul- tural workers, an amendment was offered(8)as described above. A point of order was raised against the amendment, as follows:(9) MR. [H AROLD D.] C OOLEY [of North Carolina]: . .. The amendment is ob-viously not in order, since the author of the amendment clearly indicates it is an effort to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act, which is not before the House at this time at all. Mr. Eugene J. McCarthy, of Minnesota, in support of the amendment, stated: Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that there is an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act already in the bill, and it would seem to me another amendment to the same effect would not constitute a serious obstacle. The Chairman,(10)in ruling on the point of order, stated: The bill H.R. 3283 refers to a certain class of Mexican nationals, as de- scribed in the bill. The amendment of- fered by the gentleman from Texas does not relate to this group described in the bill, but to an entirely different group of individualsÐAmerican citi- zens and residents of the United States. The amendment therefore is beyond the purview of the bill H.R. 3283, and the Chair sustains the point of order.

In the 76th Congress, a bill(11) was under consideration amend- ing the Interstate Commerce Act. The bill stated in part:(12) Sec. 6. (a) Paragraph (1) of section 3 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, is amended to read as fol- lows: (1) It shall be unlawful for any common carrier . .. to . .. give ... any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any par- ticular person, company, firm, cor- poration . .. district, territory, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever. ... (b) The Interstate Commerce Com- mission is authorized and directed to institute an investigation into (certain) rates on manufactured products. ... The following amendment was offered:(13) Amendment offered by Mr. Jones of Texas: On page 202, line 12, after the word ``ever'', strike out the quotation marks; and, after line 12, add the fol- lowing:(1a) It is hereby declared to be the policy of Congress that shippers of wheat, cotton, and other farm com- modities for export should have sub- stantially the same advantage of re- duced rates as compared to shippers of such commodities not for export that are in effect in the case of ship- ment of industrial products for ex- port as compared with shipments of industrial products not for export, and the Interstate Commerce Com- mission is hereby directed to insti- tute such investigations, to conduct such hearings, and to issue orders making such revision of rates as may be necessary for the purpose of car- rying out such policy. Mr. Alfred L. Bulwinkle, of North Carolina, raised the point of order that the amendment was not germane to the section of the bill to which offered, and con- tended that the language to which the amendment was directed was that referring to investigation of rates on manufactured prod- ucts.(14)Mr. Marvin Jones, of Texas, in responding to the point of order made by Mr. Bulwinkle, pointed out that paragraph (1), to which the amendment was actu- ally directed, related to ``all kinds of discrimination in freight rates.''

In the 82d Congress, during consideration of a bill(16)pro- viding as described above, the fol- lowing amendment was of- fered:(17) Amendment offered by Mr. Edwin Arthur Hall: , line 7, insert a new section as follows: The National Production Authority shall take all steps possible to allo- cate from domestic supplies enough baling twine to meet the needs of American farmers not only for the 1951 purpose but for all subsequent emergencies. Mr. Jere Cooper, of Tennessee, made the point of order that the amendment was not germane to the bill. In defense of the amend-ment, the proponent stated as fol- lows: MR. E DWIN ARTHUR HALL [of New York]: Mr. Chairman, we are here to try to get baling twine for the farmers of the country. ... [T]his amendment should be submitted to a vote since it is an honest effort to accomplish the objective which we are all here to try to accomplish. The Chairman,(18)in ruling on the point of order, stated: The gentleman from New York offers an amendment that has for its purpose apparently an increase in the domestic supply of baling twine. The pending legislation is an amendment to the Tariff Act of 1930. It appears from an examination of the gentleman's amend- ment that it goes far beyond the scope of the bill, in that it applies to dif- ferent legislation; therefore the Chair sustains the point of order.

[K EITH G.] S EBELIUS [of Kan- sas]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amend- ment.The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Sebelius: after line 21, insert the following: ``(4)(A) Notwithstanding any provi- sion of law, whenever the President of the United States or any other member of the executive branch of the Federal Government suspends or causes a suspension of export sales of corn, wheat, soybeans, grain sor- ghum, or cotton, the Secretary of Ag- riculture shall make payments de- scribed in subsection (B) and (C) to any farmowner or operator who has in storage at the beginning of the suspension any amount of the com- modity for which export sales have been suspended; except that no such payments may be made with regard to any such commodity unless, at the close of the calendar month pre- ceding the calendar month in which the suspension is initiated, the price received by producers of such com- modity was less than the parity price. ``(B) The first payment described in subsection (A) shall become pay- able at the initiation of the suspen- sion of export sales of the commodity concerned. Such payment shall be made at a rate of 10 per centum of the parity price per bushel or bale of the commodity concerned which was produced by the farm owner or oper- ator and which is held in storage by him at the time of the initiation of the suspension. ... MR. [C LEMENT J.] Z ABLOCKI [of Wis- consin]: Mr. Chairman, apparently the amendment the gentleman from Kan- sas (Mr. Sebelius) has presented is a parity amendment pending in the part of the bill before the Agriculture Com- mittee.

8837AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 Frank E. Evans (Colo.).2.H.R. 8357 (Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce). See 100 C ONG. REC. 6408, 83d Cong. 2d Sess., May 11, 1954.limit export controls for foreign policy purposes under the Export Administra- tion Act. Second, the amendment gives the President new authority where export controls are imposed for new purposes under a new act. And, third, this new authority deals solely with domestic matters which are within the jurisdiction of another coun- try. As I said, it is a parity amendment. Lastly, this is a farm subsidy issue, not an issue of foreign affairs. This bill does not deal with agricul- tural parity, it does not deal with sup- port controls. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I submit that the amendment is not in order. ... THE CHAIRMAN :(1)The Chair is ready to rule. H.R. 5840 is a bill to amend the Ex- port Administration Act of 1969 in order to extend the authorities of that act, improve the administration of ex- port controls under that act, and to strengthen the antiboycott provisions of that act. Section 105 of the bill as amended amends the procedure by which the Secretary of Commerce can notify the Congress of the exercise of authority curtailing exports of agricultural prod- ucts. It thereafter gives the Congress a certain period of time within which to disapprove if it so chooses. The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Kansas (Mr. Sebelius) goes beyond the purview of the title and the section to which offered, in that it would require payments by theSecretary of Agriculture to any farm- owner or operator who has in storage at the beginning of the suspension any amount of the commodity for which ex- port sales have been suspended. For the reasons stated by the Chair and the reasons given by the gen- tleman from Wisconsin, the point of order is sustained. Size of Specified Container Under Standard Container ActÐAmendment Delegating Authority to Secretary of Ag- riculture to Regulate Various Container Sizes §35.16 To a bill amending the Standard Container Act only to provide for one additional size of container, an amend- ment inserting in the act a new section delegating to the Secretary of Agriculture au- thority to regulate the size of certain containers was held not germane. In the 83d Congress, a bill(2) was under consideration to amend the Standard Container Act of The bill stated in part:(3) (bb) The standard three-eighths bushel hamper or round-stave basket shall contain eight hundred and six and four-tenths cubic inches.

Whenever in his judgment such action is advisable . .. the Sec- retary of Agriculture may by regulationsÐ (1) provide for standard hampers and round stave baskets for fruits and vegetables. ... Mr. Joseph P. O'Hara, of Min- nesota, made the point of order that the amendment was not ger- mane, stating,(5)``[I]t involves an attempt to change the Constitu- tion of the United States in dele- gating authority to the Secretary of Agriculture. . ..'' Mr. Peter F. Mack, Jr., of Illinois, the pro- ponent of the amendment, stated: ... I believe this amendment mere- ly delegates authority for administra- tion to the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary of Agriculture already has, by reason of the act of 1928, au- thority to establish allowances for var- ious containers. I believe that this amendment merely gives him addi- tional authority to establish containers in addition to the ones already pro- vided for. The Chairman(6)sustained the point of order, citing the rule that: Where a bill proposes to amend a law in one particular . . . amendments seeking to repeal the law or relating to the terms of the law rather than to the bill are not germane.Bill To Extend Price Control ActÐAmendment To Exempt Livestock Products §35.17 To a bill to extend the Price Control Act, an amend- ment providing that notwith- standing any provisions of the act no regulation, direc- tive, or allocation should be issued or maintained with respect to livestock or any edible product processed from livestock was held ger- mane.

[F RANK E.] H OOK [of Michigan]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment on the ground that it goes beyond the scope of the bill and is not germane to either the sec- tion or the bill. The Chairman,(9)in ruling on the point of order, stated: ... The Chair invites attention to the fact that the amendment is con- fined to the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 which is sought here to be amended, and the Chair is of the opin- ion that the amendment is germane. Section of Price Control Act Extension Relating to Meat SubsidiesÐAmendment To Eliminate Livestock and Meat Subsidies §35.18 To a section of the Emergency Price Control Act relating to subsidies for meat and other commodities, an amendment seeking to elimi- nate livestock and meat sub- sidies was held germane. The following proceedings in the 79th Congress,(10)during consider- ation of the Emergency Price Con- trol Act,(11)concerned the ger-maneness of an amendment of- fered by Mr. John W. Flannagan, Jr., of Virginia: Amendment offered by Mr. Flannagan: Amend section 5, page 6, line 20, by striking out ``meat, $715,000,000.'' Amend section 5, page 8, line 2, by inserting a colon in lieu of the pe- riod at the end of the sentence and adding the following: `` Provided fur- ther, That no funds . .. shall be used after June 30, 1946, to continue any existing program or to institute any new program for the payment of subsidies on livestock or meat de- rived from livestock . .. And pro- vided further, That in order to pre- vent the reduction of livestock prices upon the elimination of such live- stock and meat subsidy payments, the Administrator shall make cor- responding increases in maximum prices of livestock, meat, and meat products. ...'' MR. [F RANK E.] H OOK [of Michigan]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment on the ground, first, that it is not germane to the bill, and, second, that it goes far beyond the authorization and scope of this bill. The bill only provides for the extension of the Office of Price Administration and Stabilization and this takes in many other acts and agencies. ... MR.

Amendment Modifying Defini- tion of ``Agriculture'' in Fair Labor Standards Act §35.19 To a substitute modi- fying the definition of the term ``agriculture'' in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to include the proc- essing of tobacco, and con- taining diverse other amend- ments to that Act, an amend- ment adding to that defini- tion transportation of fruit and vegetables and transpor- tation of persons employed in harvesting such commod- ities was held to be germane. In the 87th Congress, a bill(13) was under consideration to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and to establish a new min- imum wage. The following amend- ment was offered to the bill:(14) Amendment offered by Mr. [William H.] Ayres [of Ohio]: Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the fol- lowing: ``That this Act may be cited as the `Fair Labor Standards Amend- ments of 1961.' ''DEFINITIONS Sec. 2. (a) Paragraph (f) of section 3 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended by inserting after ``Agricultural Marketing Act, as amended),'' the following: ``the proc- essing of shade-grown tobacco for use as cigar wrapper tobacco by agri- cultural employees employed in the growing and harvesting of such to- bacco, which processing shall in- clude, but shall not be limited to, drying, curing . .. and bailing, prior to the stemming process,''. (b) Paragraph (m) of section 3 of such Act, defining the term ``wage'', is amended by inserting before the period at the end thereof a colon and the following: `` Provided, That the cost of board, lodging or other facili- ties shall not be included as a part of the wage paid to any employee to the extent it is excluded therefrom under the terms of a bona fide individual contract or collective bargaining agreement applicable to the par- ticular employee''.

Walter (Pa.).``(e) Whenever the Secretary has reason to believe that in any indus- try under this Act the competition of foreign producers in United States markets or in markets abroad, or both, has resulted, or is likely to re- sult, in increased unemployment in the United States, he shall under- take an investigation to gain full in- formation with respect to the matter and shall make a full and complete report of his findings and determina- tions to the President and to the Congress.''. .. Sec. 11. The Secretary of Labor shall study the complicated system of exemptions now available for the handling and processing of agricul- tural products under such Act and particularly sections 7(b)(3), 7(c), and 13(a)(10), and shall submit to the second session of the Eighty-seventh Congress at the time of his report under section 4(d) of such Act a spe- cial report containing the results of such study and information, data, and recommendations for further legislation designed to simplify and remove the inequities in the applica- tion of such exemptions. Subsequently, the following amendment was offered:(15) Amendment offered by Mr. [Albert S.] Herlong [Jr.], of Florida, to the amendment offered by Mr. Ayres, of Ohio: , line 5, strike out the pe- riod and add the following: ``and in the case of fruits and vegetables in- cludes transportation and prepara- tion for transportation, whether or not performed by the farmer, of the commodity from the farm to a place of first processing or first marketing within the same State, (2) transpor- tation, whether or not performed by the farmer, between the farm and any point within the same State ofpersons employed or to be employed in the harvesting of the commodity.'' Mr. Roman C. Pucinski, of Illi- nois, made a point of order against the Herlong amendment on the ground that it was not ger- mane. In support of the point of order, Mr. James G. O'Hara, of Michigan, stated: The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Florida attempts to amend not the act before us, but Public Law 78, under which migrant labor is brought into the country, and the other act of Congress under which the U.S. Employment Service is established. An exemption already exists under the Fair Labor Standards Act, exempt- ing agricultural labor from the applica- tion of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and this is an attempt to amend not the Fair Labor Standards Act, but other acts passed by various Con- gresses. The Chairman,(16)in ruling on the point of order, stated: This is unquestionably an amend- ment to the Fair Labor Standards Act. It specifically refers to the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Chair overrules the point of order.

Amendments to Norris- LaGuardia and Taft-Hartley are not germane. ... MR. E RLENBORN : ... My amend- ment, as I think the Chair is aware, amends section 10 of the National Labor Relations Act. Section 10 is amended in the bill before us. This amendment would add section 10(n) to that act. It is remedial, it is procedural, and it is consonant with the bill before us as reported by the committee. Mr. Chairman, I think it is clearly a remedial, procedural amendment to a section of the act which has been amended by the committee bill and is in order under all of the previous rul- ings of the Chair. THECHAIRMAN : The Chair is ready to rule. The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Illinois [Mr. Erlenborn] adds a new section to the bill. The bill as a whole does not deal exclusively with the period of initial organizational activity as it relates to remedies. Cer- tain remedies in the bill go to post-or- ganizational conduct. The amendment adds a new remedy. In the opinion of the Chair, the amendment is germane to the bill as a whole and the point of order is over- ruled.Bill Amending One Section of Labor-Management Relations ActÐAmendment Affecting Entire Act §35.21 To a bill amending a section of the Labor-Manage- ment Relations Act to permit employer contributions for joint industry promotion of products within the con- struction industry, an amendment applicable in scope to all industries cov- ered by the act and relating to funds established for polit- ical education was held to be not germane.

It would es- tablish the joint administration of funds for political purposes, a subject not mentioned in the subject matter of the legislation before us. The Chairman,(2)in ruling on the point of order, stated: The bill under consideration amends only section 302(c) of the act, whereas the proposed amendment attempts to amend the entire act and brings in new matter that is not covered in sec- tion 302(c) or in the bill. The Chair rules that the amendment is not germane, and sustains the point of order. Negotiation of Labor Dis- putesÐAmendment To Em- power President To Seize Plants Threatened With Work Stoppages §35.22 To a bill extending and amending a law that pro- vided for settlement of labor disputes primarily through negotiation between the par- ties to such disputes, an amendment to empower the President to take possession of plants threatened with work stoppages that are con-sidered to endanger the na- tional defense was held not germane.

The Chairman,(5)in ruling on the point of order, stated:(6) The Chair has had an opportunity to study the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Bolling] and it is the opinion of the Chair that the amendment proposes to make basic changes in our labor legislation. The amendment proposes further to amend title II of the Defense Production Act of 1950, which is the authority to requisi- tion property. The amendment goes be- yond . .. the mere requisition of prop- erty and . .. proposes to make changes in our labor laws. In view of the fact that it goes be- yond the scope of title II of the Defense Production Act of 1950, the Chair is constrained to sustain the point of order. ... Bill To Permit Common Situs PicketingÐAmendment Relat- ing to Another Section of Law Providing Remedies for Un- fair Practices §35.23 Where it is proposed to amend existing law in one particular, an amendment to further amend the law in an- other respect unrelated to the bill is not germane; thus, to a narrowly drafted bill de- signed to amend section 8 of the National Labor RelationsAct, dealing with unfair labor practices, to permit common situs picketing under certain circumstances, an amendment further quali- fying the right to so picket and providing a civil remedy for persons injured by illegal pickets was ruled out as not germane, being beyond the scope of the bill, since the law itself provided remedies for unfair labor practices in another section and the bill was not sufficiently broad to admit as germane amend- ments relating to that sec- tion. During consideration of H.R. 5900 in the Committee of the Whole on July 25, 1975,(7)the Chair sustained a point of order in the circumstances described above.

It affects only the question of construction workers picketing a construction site, and it goes very narrowly to that point. On the other hand, the amendment offered by the gentleman from Lou- isiana (Mr. Moore) goes ahead and sets up a cause of action against labor orga- nizations in Federal district courts, re- covering lost wages and so forth. It might be a germane provision to the National Labor Relations Act, but it is not a germane amendment to this particular section of the act or to the bill that is now before us. ... MR. MOORE : Mr. Chairman, I oppose the point of order on the ground that VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01466 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

8847AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 William H. Natcher (Ky.).this bill takes away this power under the appropriate section of this act. All this does is exempt this proviso of this particular action as it applies to these particular employees, and this exemp- tion to such a provision in this bill is germane. The fact that it gives the right of civil action means nothing more than to strengthen the abilities of this particular proviso. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I submit that it is indeed very much germane. THE CHAIRMAN :(8)The Chair is ready to rule. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. O'Hara) makes the point of order that the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Louisiana (Mr. Moore) is not germane. The gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Moore) has been kind enough to sub- mit a copy of his amendment in ad- vance, and the Chair has had the op- portunity to study the amendment and to read the report of the committee, and the bill. The Chair would state that the fun- damental purpose of the bill is to per- mit under certain conditions situs strikes which are, as the result of a Supreme Court decision, considered to be unfair labor practices under section 8(b) of the National Labor Relations Act. The Chair notes that the amendment provides a civil remedy for violation of the provisions of the amendment. The act itself, in another section, provides remedies for unfair labor practices. The remedy proposed here might be germane to that section of the act con- taining such remedies, however that section of the act is not before theCommittee, and the specific amend- ment to section 8(b)(4) of the act con- tained in this bill is not such an inclu- sive amendment to existing law as to open the entire act to amendment under the precedents of the House. The Chair therefore finds that the provision for civil remedies for unfair labor practices is not germane to the portion of the act defining those prac- tices, and sustains the point of order. Requirement of Certification of Elections Involving Labor UnionsÐAmendment Con- taining Additional Cir- cumstances in Which Certifi- cation Required §35.24 While an amendment narrowly amending one por- tion of existing law does not necessarily open up the en- tire law to amendment, such an amendment may be amended by adding excep- tions and definitions modi- fying its effect on that por- tion of law if related to the same subject; thus, to an amendment amending sec. 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act to require NLRB certifications of em- ployee elections of unions as exclusive bargaining agents only where there has been a secret ballot, a substitute amendment containing the same requirement with ex- VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01467 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

During consideration of H.R. 8410(9)in the Committee of the Whole on Oct. 6, 1977,(10)the Chair overruled a point of order against the amendment described above. The proceedings were as follows: THECHAIRMAN :(11)If there are no additional amendments to section 8, the Clerk will read. The Clerk read as follows: Sec. 9.

MR. A SHBROOK : Mr. Chairman, I raise the point of order on the basis of the Chair's previous construction of H.R. 8410 and amendments offered thereto. I point out to the Chair the amend- ment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ford) is not within the scope of the bill. It refers in three places to section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act. Section 9(a) is not opened up, as the Chair can determine, by H.R. 8410. It is nongermane to my amendment. It goes beyond the scope of my amendment. The gentleman from Michigan himself has indicated that what he is trying to do is codify a principle in case law. That in effect is a substantive effort. ... MR. F ORD of Michigan: . . . Mr. Chairman, I agree with the gentleman that I am attempting to codify the case law, but I thought that I was agreeing with his attempt to codify the case law because we are both citing the same case as authority for the language we would now have as a part of the stat- ute. As to that part of the change in the amendment that is common to both his amendment and mine, the basis of the case law we have cited is exactly thesame. Mine certainly could not be found not to be germane, inasmuch as we rely on exactly the same basis for the language. Moreover, there is noth- ing in my substitute that makes sub- stantive changes in the law with re- spect to the rights of employers and employees. It has to do only with pro- cedural practices in keeping with the entire thrust of this bill to improve and streamline and codify for that purpose past practices and procedures. With respect to section 9 of the act, while it might be said that these proce- dures refer to section 9 of the act, for that matter they refer to all of the act. But they are limited, and this amend- ment is limited to affecting the method by which these improvements achieve the end of the act and not intended in any way to effect a substantial change in the sections of the act that are sub- ject to this procedure. ... MR. A SHBROOK : Mr. Chairman, I would merely want to reiterate that the gentleman's amendment clearly re- fers to section 9(a). Section 9(a) has not been opened up by this act. It is not a proper substitute. The Chair on several occasions has taken a very strict interpretation of H.R. 8410 as it relates to the National Labor Relations Act, and I do not believe it can be opened up at this point inconsistent with those rulings. THECHAIRMAN : The Chair would like to inquire of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ford) as to how his sub- stitute would affect section 9(a) of the act. MR. FORD of Michigan: 9(a) of the bill?

FORD of Michigan: Mr. Chair- man, I do not believe that I do. I be- lieve that the gentleman limits the method by which a collective bar- gaining arrangement can come into being, and we simply return to the ex- isting law. If the gentleman would make a change in existing law, we stay with the existing law. THECHAIRMAN : The Chair is ready to rule. The question, of course, pertains to the germaneness of the amendment of- fered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ford) as a substitute for the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ashbrook). That is the test. The substitute amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ford), down to section 9, in the middle of the first page, contains the same language of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ashbrook). From that point in the sub- stitute, the Chair is of the opinion that the substitute sets forth exceptions to the Ashbrook amendment and incor- porates definitions contained in section 9(a) of the act without amending other sections of the law, and it seems to be related to and is germane to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ashbrook). Therefore, the Chair overrules the point of order. Procedural Rules Governing Labor Organization and ElectionsÐAmendment Relat- ing to Unfair Labor Practices §35.25 Where the pending sec- tion of a bill proposes toamend existing law in one particular, an amendment to further amend the law in an- other respect unrelated to the pending portion of the bill and to the portion of ex- isting law which it amends is not germane; thus, to a sec- tion of a bill amending that section of the National Labor Relations Act relating to pro- cedural rules governing labor elections and organiza- tion, an amendment chang- ing the same section of exist- ing law to require the pro- mulgation of rules defining certain conduct as grounds for voiding a labor election was held not germane, where neither the pending section nor the bill itself addressed the subject of unfair labor practices as dealt with in an- other section of existing law. During consideration of H.R. 8410(12)in the Committee of the Whole on Oct. 5, 1977,(13)the Chair sustained a point of order against the amendment described above. The proceedings were as follows: MR. [J OHN M.] A SHBROOK [of Ohio]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.

8851AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 Amendment offered by Mr. Ashbrook: , line 5, insert ``(i)'' after ``(A)'' and insert the following new subparagraph (ii) after line 15: ``(ii) which shall assure that the expressing of any views, arguments, opinion, or the making of any state- ment (including expressions intended to influence the outcome of an orga- nizing campaign, a bargaining con- troversy, a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute), or the dissemination thereof, whether in written, printed, graphic, visual, or auditory form, shall not constitute grounds for, or evidence justifying, setting aside the results of any election conducted under any of the provisions of this Act, if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.''. .. MR. [W ILLIAM D.] F ORD [of Michi- gan]: Mr. Chairman, I insist upon my point of order. ... Mr. Chairman, the amendment of- fered is to section 3 of the bill, which in its present form amends section 6 of the National Labor Relations Act, which is the rulemaking authority of that act. Under section 3, the Board is directed to make rules that: First, af- fect union actions during representa- tion campaigns; second, define classes of representation cases; and third, schedules governing the holding of elections. The amendment proposed effectively changes section 8(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, not before us in this bill, which deals with unfair labor practices. As such, it is not directed at the limited subject and scope of this bill in dealing with rulemaking amend- ments, as H.R. 8410 directs. It is not in keeping with the act, and the bill, which provides broad discre- tion to the Board in its rulemaking ca-pacity. Rather, it restricts absolutely the nature and substance of the rule the Board is directed to make. The amendment deals not only with organization campaign and representa- tion cases, which is the subject matter of this bill, but with strikes, lockouts, and other labor disputes which are not within the parameters of H.R. 8410, or section 3 of the committee bill. Mr. Chairman, the amendment is therefore nongermane. ... MR. A SHBROOK : Mr. Chairman, on page 17 of the bill, starting with line 1 of this act, it says: The Board shall within 12 months after the date of enactment of the Labor Reform Act of 1977 issue regu- lations to implement the provisions of section 9(c)(6) including rulesÐ And it goes on, as a matter of fact, on lines 3 through 15 in the subject matter we just dispensed with a few moments ago. We specifically dealt with the subject matter of both em- ployers and employees attempting free speech, speaking to those employees, I think, going back again to page 16 and talking about making the regulations, referring to rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the pro- visions of this act. Mr. Chairman, in the very preamble of this act it says: To amend the National Labor Re- lations Act to strengthen the rem- edies and expedite the procedures under such Act. Mr. Chairman, I feel that this amendment, calling upon the Board to issue rules, in addition to the rules that are in H.R. 8410, is within the pa- rameters of the debate and therefore the point of order should be overruled.

8852DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 William H. Natcher (Ky.).15.The Labor Reform Act of 1977. 123 C ONG. REC. 32507, 32508, 95th Cong. 1st Sess.THE CHAIRMAN :(14)The Chair is ready to rule. The Chair has carefully followed the remarks of both gentlemen. The Chair is of the opinion that the point of order made by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ford) should be sustained. The Chair would like to state that under section 3 of the committee bill that is now before the Committee it amends section 6 of the National Labor Relations Act and restates the existing authority of the NLRB to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of the act, specifically in- cluding certain authority to make pro- cedural rules governing elections and governing the period of initial stages of organizational activity. The section of the bill does not go to newly mandated directions to the Board to promulgate regulations to implement section 8 of the act. The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Ohio (Mr. Ashbrook), while not directly amending section 8 of the act, would amend section 6 of the act to direct the Board to promul- gate regulations, and the amendment would by its terms elevate those regu- lations to a position of substantive law, which regulations would conclusively pronounce what conduct shall or shall not constitute grounds for setting aside an election. In such form, the amendment goes beyond the issue of implementing rule- making authority and deals directly with the question of whether conduct, for the first time, would constitute an unfair labor practice beyond the period of initial stages of organizational activ- ity, a matter not addressed by the com- mittee bill in section 3.Therefore, the point of order is sus- tained. §35.26 To a section of a bill narrowly amending one sec- tion of existing law dealing with procedural rules gov- erning labor elections and organization, an amendment to require promulgation of rules defining unfair labor practices, a subject covered in another section of the law but not addressed in the pending section of the bill, was held to be not germane. During consideration of H.R. 8410(15)in the Committee of the Whole on Oct. 5, 1977,(16)the Chair, in sustaining a point of order against the amendment de- scribed above, reiterated the prop- osition that an amendment must be germane to the section of the bill to which it is offered. The pro- ceedings were as follows: MR. [J OHN M.] A SHBROOK [of Ohio]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amend- ment. ... The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Ashbrook: , after line 5, in- sert the following new paragraph (c): ``(c) The Board shall within three months after the date of enactment of the Labor Reform Act of 1977, issue rules or regulations to imple- VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01472 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

Natcher (Ky.).ment the provisions of section 8(b)(1) including rules which shall assure that no labor organization shall threaten or impose an unreasonable disciplinary fine or other economic sanction against any person in the exercise of rights under the Act (in- cluding but not limited to the right to refrain from any or all concerted activity or to invoke the processes of the Board).'' MR. [F RANK ] THOMPSON [Jr., of New Jersey]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment. ... Mr. Chairman, the amendment of- fered by my colleague and friend from Ohio (Mr. Ashbrook), although in some ways meritorious, is offered to section 3 of the bill which amends section 6 of the National Labor Relations Act, the rulemaking authority. Under section 3, the Board is directed to make rules, first, that assure equal access during representation campaigns, which we have done; second, that define classes of representation cases; and three, schedules governing the holding of elections. The amendment offered, in effect, changes section 8 of the act relating to unfair labor practices. It is directed, therefore, at a subject not con- templated in the bill and establishes a new unfair labor practice, and is not germane to the committee bill or to section 3. ... MR. ASHBROOK : . . . I believe this does come under the general rule- making. It is in section 6. Further- more, when we refer to willful viola- tions, on page 22, in section 7, this bill does refer to unfair labor practices, and I think under the previous prece- dents established, where we open up a section referring to unfair labor prac- tices, it is now not timely for the chair-man to say that this bill does not amend unfair labor practices. Section 7 clearly refers to unfair labor practices, as does my amendment to section 3, and I would hope the Chair would overrule the point of order. THE CHAIRMAN :(17)The Chair is ready to rule. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ashbrook) has offered an amendment that, while not directly amending sec- tion 8 of the act, would amend section 6 of the act to direct the Board to pro- mulgate regulations. The amendment would really reach issues of sub- stantive law, since the regulations would conclusively pronounce that cer- tain union conduct shall constitute an unfair labor practice under section 8. In such form, the amendment goes be- yond the issue of implementing rule- making authority and deals directly with the question of conduct which for the first time would constitute an un- fair labor practice beyond the period of initial stages of organizational activity, a matter not addressed by the com- mittee bill in section 3. The reference of the gentleman from Ohio to the provisions of section 7 does not alter the fact that an amendment must be germane to the pending sec- tion. For that reason, the Chair must sus- tain the point of order.

Carnahan, of Missouri, who stated:(10) Mr. Chairman, the Mutual Security Act of 1954, which the bill S. 2130 seeks to amend, states in its statement of policy among other things that the Congress of the United States ``de- clares it to be the policy of the United States to continue as long as such dan- ger to the peace of the world and to the security of the United States persists to make available to free nations and VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01476 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

This legislation does not provide for the conduct, management, or regula- tion of American forces abroad. Con- sequently, the amendment is not ger- mane. Speaking in support of the point of order, Mr. John M. Vorys, of Ohio, stated:(11) Mr. Chairman, on page 407 of the Rules of the House of Representatives on the matter of germaneness appears the statement that to a bill modifying an existing law as to one specific par- ticular an amendment relating to the terms of the law other than those dealt with by the bill is not germane. Vol- ume V, page 806, of Cannon's Prece- dents is cited and there are other cita- tions as well. Mr. Chairman, this amendment at- tempts to amend the purpose clauses of the mutual security law, which is a part of the bill which is not amended by the amendment contained in the bill, S. 2130, which is now before the House. ... In addition, the amend- ment . .. would amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Article 14 of the code provides that under such reg- ulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, a member of the Armed Forces accused of an offense against civil authority may be delivered upon request to the civil authority for trial.Article 5 of the same code says: ``This chapter applies in all places.'' So that this would purport to amend the Uniform Code of Military Jus- tice. ... Other Members spoke on the point of order, as follows:(12) MR. [JAMES G.] F ULTON [of Pennsyl- vania]: Mr. Chairman, certainly in the first place the method of trial of United States troops stationed abroad is not germane in an economic and military aid bill for foreign countries. Secondly, attention should be called to the statement that has been made by the gentleman from Ohio that the revision of United States treaties or ex- ecutive agreements in this type of a bill is clearly not germane to the pur- pose of the bill. Thirdly, as stated by the gentleman from Texas, the sponsor of the par- ticular amendment, if his purpose is directly or indirectly to have a reduc- tion effect upon the number of armed United States forces abroad or the number of military people in our mili- tary installations, that policy is clearly a matter of jurisdiction of the House Armed Services Committee, and is not in any way connected with or germane to this legislation. ... MR. [F RANK T.] B OW[of Ohio]: . .. This amendment merely amends the purpose clauses of the act of 1954, in which there are other purposes other than the ones which have been re- ferred to. This does not attempt to amend the treaty. ... It simply ex- presses the sense of the Congress that the President take some action to at- VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01477 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

It simply expresses the will of the Congress under the purpose clauses of this legislation, as a matter of policy. ... MR. [W INSTON L.] P ROUTY [of Vermont]: . .. I think if we look at the proposed amendment we will find it deals with a different subject matter. The subject matter of the bill S. 2130 is mutual security. The subject matter of the amendment is qualification of treaties or other international agree- ments. ... Mr. Vorys further observed: ... The fact that it is a policy state- ment rather than a direct amendment does not make it any the more ger- mane. The Chairman,(13)in ruling on the point of order, stated:(14) Attention is . .. invited to the fact that the amendment does not seek to amend the treaty-making powers, it does not seek to amend the Code of Military Justice. It simply expresses the sense of Congress that the Presi- dent should forthwith address to the North Atlantic Council, and so forth. It is an expression of the sense of Con- gress going one step further than the expressions of the sense of Congress provided in the Mutual Security Act of ... ... [T]he Chair is of the opinion that the amendment is an additional expression of the sense of Congress in line with the expressions of the senseof Congress contained in the Mutual Security Act of 1954, it is germane to the pending bill, and, therefore, over- rules the point of order.

Section 101(f) of the Ag- ricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, as amended, is amended to read as follows: ``(f) obtain rates of exchange appli- cable to the sale of commodities in European countries under such agreements which are not less favor- able than the highest of exchange rates legally obtainable from the Government or agencies thereof in the respective countries.'' In regard to the amendment, the proponent, Mr. Robert R. Barry, of New York, stated: Mr. Chairman, the amendment which I am proposing is intended to assure that our surplus farm commod- ities are sold on best possible termsÐ specifically, at rates of exchange not less favorable than the highest rates legally obtainable from the govern- ments, or governmental agencies, of the purchasing countries. A point of order against the amendment was explained as fol- lows: MR. [H AROLD D.] C OOLEY [of North Carolina]: Mr. Chairman, the amend- ment here is to Public Law 480, which is the Agricultural Act, and the par- ticular section to which it is addressed is section 101(f) of Public Law 480.That is not now before the House. The gentleman's amendment is not ger- mane to any section of the bill. I there- fore insist on the point of order. The following exchange(17)re- lated to the point of order: THECHAIRMAN :(18)The burden of proof is always on the person who pro- poses an amendment. ... MR. BARRY : I believe it is germane. Therefore, I am asking for a ruling to sustain my belief. THECHAIRMAN : The bill before the Committee, H.R. 11921, to amend fur- ther the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and for other pur- poses, refers, of course, to the act of In the act of 1961 itself specific provision was made for amendment of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, to which the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from New York refers. The Chair believes that the subject matter of the Agricultural Trade De- velopment and Assistance Act of 1954 is included within the purview of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which is the bill before the Committee and, therefore, feels that the amendment of- fered by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Barry] is germane to the bill.

In the 87th Congress, the For- eign Assistance Act of 1962(19) was under consideration, con- taining the following provision:(20) PARTIVÐA MENDMENTS TO OTHER LAWS Sec. 403. The first section of the Act entitled ``An Act to authorize participa- tion by the United States in the Inter- parliamentary Union,'' approved June 28, 1935, as amended (22 U.S.C. 276), is amended by adding at the end there- of the following: ``Not less than two of the principal delegates to each of the Conferences of the Interparliamentary Union shall be members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and not less than two of such delegates shall be members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.'' The above provision having been stricken, the following amendment was offered to the bill:(1)Amendment offered by Mr. [Robert R.] Barry [of New York]: On page 16, after line 15, insert the following: Sec. 404. The first section of the Act entitled ``An Act to authorize participation by the United States in parliamentary conferences of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,'' approved July 11, 1956, is amended by adding at the end thereof the fol- lowing: ``Of the appointments made by the Speaker of the House not less than two shall be members of the Foreign Affairs Committee.'' A point of order was raised against the amendment, as fol- lows: MR. [W AYNE L.] H AYS[of Ohio]: . .. [The amendment] deals with an act of Congress which is a separate act, and which is not contained in this bill. Since section 403 has been stricken, there is nothing in this bill about any interparliamentary group whatever. Therefore it is not germane to the bill. The Chairman,(2)in ruling on the point of order, stated: ... Just a moment ago section 403 was stricken from the bill. That section was the only section that had anything to do with any international group. This amendment refers to parliamen- tary conferences of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The bill itself has the purpose of further amending the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and for other purposes.

A point of order was raised against the amendment, as fol- lows: MR.

It has been ruled here many times that one cannot do that. In addition, it is not germane to the bill because we are coming up with a military sales bill, and this bill has nothing about military sales in it.

Studds (Mass.).poses, an amendment further changing that law but affect- ing programs beyond the scope of the bill and the law being amended and waiving other inconsistent provisions of law is not germane. On Sept. 23, 1977,(19)the Com- mittee of the Whole had under consideration a bill(20)jointly re- ported from the Committees on Ways and Means and Interstate and Foreign Commerce to enable the Department of Health, Edu- cation and Welfare to investigate and prosecute fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid health programs within their respective jurisdictions. An amendment was recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means to prohibit any federal officer or employee from disclosing any identifiable medical record in the absence of patient approval. The amendment was held not germane, as exceed- ing the scope and subject matter of the bill. The proceedings were as follows: THECHAIRMAN :(1)The Clerk will re- port the second amendment rec- ommended by the Committee on Ways and Means. The Clerk read as follows:Amendment offered by the Com- mittee on Ways and Means: , strike out line 22 down through and including line 5 on page 70 and in- sert in lieu thereof: (l)(1) Part A of title XI of such Act (as amended by section 3(a) of this Act) is amended by adding after sec- tion 1124 the following new section: ``DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE MEDICAL RECORDS ``Sec. 1125.

8868DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 medical records (whether they relate to medical care provided directly by, or through the financial assistance of, the Federal Government or not), and (B) prevent the unwarranted in- spection by, and disclosure to, Fed- eral officers, employees, and agents and Professional Standards Review Organizations of such records. ... MR. [R ICHARDSON ] PREYER [of North Carolina]: Mr. Chairman, I raise a point of order against the amend- ment. ... [T]his amendment in its scope would apply far beyond the purpose of the bill and the jurisdiction of the committee. The jurisdiction of the committee and the purpose of the bill is to deal with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and increase the Depart- ment's ability to investigate and pros- ecute medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse. However, the amendment covers not only the Department of Health, Edu- cation, and Welfare but all the officers, employees, and agents of the United States. The committee report specifi- cally states, ``Under the bill PSRO's and employees or agents of the Federal Government may not inspect, acquire or require the disclosure of individually identifiable medical records.'' The Ways and Means Committee does not have jurisdiction, for example, over the employees of the Department of De- fense, the Veterans' Administration, or the Federal courts. In addition this amendment clearly conflicts with the Deschler precedent in chapter 28, section 8.1, which states thatÐ To a bill limited in its application to certain departments and agencies of government, an amendment appli-cable to all departments and agen- cies is not germane. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I note the amendment attempts to supersede all other laws and regulations of the United States in conflict with this amendment. This violates the principle of the Deschler precedent in chapter 28, section 29.4 which states thatÐ To a bill referring to certain provi- sions of existing law, an amendment repealing a portion of that law was held not germane. ... MR. [P HILIP M.] C RANE [of Illinois]: ... Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the point of order. The Ways and Means amendment, set forth as section 5(l) of H.R. 3 as reported by that com- mittee, is clearly germane to the origi- nal bill and the bill in its current form. In the first place, Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3 ostensibly has as its purpose the prevention of fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs. To achieve that objective, a very com- plex set of provisions were put into the original bill, including provisions in section 5, that greatly strengthen the investigatory and enforcement roles of professional standards review organi- zations (PSRO's). These organizations do not simply acquire and inspect records only of medicare and medicaid patients, or of doctors and other health professionals who treat only those patients. Quite the contrary is true. PSRO's are re- quired to compile statistically valid ``profiles'' of patients and providers, in order to identify, among other things, patterns of suspected unnecessary services and treatment that does not conform to ``appropriate'' medical standards. In so doing, they not only VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01488 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

8869AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 mayÐthey mustÐinspect, acquire, and require the disclosure of the records of private patients and their doc- tors. ... Mr. Chairman, I am well aware of the precedents of this bodyÐand I am certain that my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee are as wellÐ that would not allow section 5(l) of H.R. 3 to be broader in scope than the original bill. The fact is, however, that section 5(h) of the bill now before us clearly extends the specter of unau- thorized violations of patients' rights to confidentiality to all patients, by all Federal agencies and departments. There is no way for Congress to know, in advance, precisely who will seek to inspect, acquire or require the disclo- sure of the data and records gathered by a PSRO and mandated to be shared with others by the original language of H.R. 3. Furthermore, a private pa- tient's medical record can be trans- formed into a medicare or medicaid pa- tient's record simply by a change in the status of the patientÐhis becoming eligible, for example, through dis- ability, age, or poverty. The medicare and medicaid programs have much to fear if the kinds of safeguards provided for in the Crane-Stark amendment are not extended to all records of patients and all Federal officials. The Crane-Stark amendment most certainly relates to the fundamental purpose of H.R. 3, and applies only to those individuals, agencies and depart- ments that are within the scope of the original bill. To decide otherwise would, I respectfully submit, signifi- cantly and adversely affect the very patients who are the intended bene- ficiaries of this important legislation. It would create potential barriers be-tween patient and doctor by inhibiting free communication, since there would be no guarantees that their jobs would be secure or their friends and families would be free from interrogation and investigation by the Federal Govern- ment. ... THECHAIRMAN : The Chair is pre- pared to rule. The gentleman from North Carolina makes the point of order against the amendment recommended by the Com- mittee on Ways and Means printed on page 66, line 22, through page 70, line 5, on the grounds that it is not ger- mane to the bill H.R. 3. The bill amends several titles of the Social Security Act to correct fraudu- lent activities under the medicare and medicaid programs by strengthening penalty sanctions, increasing disclo- sure of information requirements, im- proving the professional standards re- view program, and by proposing cer- tain administrative reforms. The amendment recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means, while addressing the role of profes- sional standards review organizations in permitting disclosure of confidential medical records of patients under medicare and medicaid programs, goes beyond that issue and encompasses a prohibition against any officer or em- ployee of the Federal Government from disclosing any identifiable medical record absent specific authorization from the patient. As drafted, the amendment would supersede any other provision of law which would otherwise permit Federal officials to disclose medical records, and would appear to affect health programs which are not medicare or medicaid related which do VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01489 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

A point of order was raised against the amendment, as fol- lows:(4) MR. [J ERE] C OOPER [of Tennessee]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Voorhis) that it is not germane to this bill or any part of it.

8872DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 John W. McCormack (Mass.). 84 C ONG. REC. 4629, 76th Cong. 1st Sess., Apr. 21, 1939. 11.Id. at p. 4630.Mr. Howard W. Smith, of Vir- ginia, made the point of order that the amendment was not germane to the bill. He argued that, where only one amendment to existing law is contained in the bill, no other amendments to the law can be proposed by way of amendment of the bill; and that, where more than one amendment is proposed in the bill, the question for the Chair is whether the bill is a gen- eral amendatory bill and thus open to amendments further modifying the law. The Chair- man,(9)in ruling on the point of order, stated:(10) The bill picks out two powers grant- ed in the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, from a number of other powers in that act, and it extends the date of expira- tion of those powers vested in the President and also in the Secretary of the Treasury, and continues those pow- ers for an additional period. Chairman McCormack then cited prior instances in which, ``to a bill amending the Federal Re- serve Act in a number of particu- lars an amendment relating to the Federal Reserve Act, but to no portion provided for in the pend- ing bill, was held not to be ger- mane''; and in which it was held that, ``to a bill amendatory of an act in several particulars anamendment proposing to modify the act but not related to the bill'' was not germane. A further ruling of the Speaker in a prior situation was quoted, as follows:(11) It does not seem to the Chair that this bill brings the whole National De- fense Act before the House. It only brings before the House a very limited portion of it, and not the portion af- fected by the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina. The Chair is disposed to sustain the point of order. The point of order is sustained. The Chair sustained the point of order.

The following ruling(12)of the Chair was made with respect to the germaneness of an amend- ment offered by Mr. Lester L. Wolff, of New York, to a bill(13) eliminating certain gold reserve requirements: THECHAIRMAN :(14)... The bill be- fore the House, H.R. 14743, deals only with the question of eliminating re- serve requirements for Federal Reserve notes and for U.S. notes and Treasury notes of 1890. The amendment offered by the gentleman from New York, while put in the form of an amend- ment to the same section of the Gold Reserve Act amended by section 8 of the bill before the Committee, has to do with war debts, a matter within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means and a matter not involved in the subject before the Committee of the Whole.

Public Law 93±110 is the Par Value Act which affected the gold value of the dollar. The amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Biaggi) attempts to amend the International Development Association Act, this has to do with nuclear materials, it is, therefore, entirely nongermane to the act which it seeks to amend. ... MR. BIAGGI : ... Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply seeks to add a new section to this bill, section 15. This sec- tion would condition any of the moneys to be spent in the event IDA is success- ful this afternoon, or any of the mon- eys to be loaned, and I use that as a euphemism because, in fact, it is an outright grant in its nature, and we have recognized it as such, and I do not think anyone thinks that we will ever have the money returned, but it represents a condition under which the money can be loaned. The fact of the matter is, the money, if it is to be loaned, cannot be used to provide nuclear technology or nuclear material in any of the proposed coun- tries, and it is my judgment that the appropriate manner in which to do that is to add an additional section, and we do that in my amendment by creating section 15. THECHAIRMAN : The Chair is pre- pared to rule on the point of order raised by the gentleman from Wis- consin (Mr. Reuss). The bill is drafted as a continuation of the U.S. Governor's authority to agree to make U.S. money available to IDA under terms of the International Development Association Act. That statute already contains several re- strictions on the Governor's authorityto cast dissenting votes for loans to na- tions lacking certain qualifications. Therefore an amendment to further re- strict the use of funds for loans under IDA, part of which are authorized by the bill, would be germane, and the point of order is overruled.(17) Extending Authorization for Contributions to Inter- national Monetary FundÐ Amendment Restricting Total Budget Outlays of Govern- ment §35.48 An amendment must be germane to the pending bill, and where the bill amends one portion of an existing law, an amendment that af- fects another provision of that law, not related to the subject of the bill, is not ger- mane; thus, to a title of a bill amending that portion of an existing law to extend the authorization for United States contributions to the International Monetary Fund, amendments affecting another section of that law by mandating, or affirming congressional commitment to mandate, that the total budg- et outlays of the federal gov- VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01495 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

During consideration of H.R. 2957(18)in the Committee of the Whole on Aug. 3, 1983,(19)the Chair sustained points of order in the circumstances described above. The proceedings were as follows: MR. [R OBERT S.] W ALKER [of Penn- sylvania]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Walk- er: On page 28, after line 8, add the following: Sec. 308. Consistent with the ob- jective of sustaining worldwide eco- nomic growth and recovery set forth in this title, section 3 of Public Law 96±389, the Bretton Woods Agree- ments Act Amendments of 1980, is amended by striking it in its entirety and inserting in lieu thereof the fol- lowing: Beginning in fiscal year 1985, the total budget outlays of the Federal Government shall not exceed its receipts. ... MR. [F ERNAND J.] S TGERMAIN [of Rhode Island]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amend- ment. ...[M]y point of order is that it relates to a balanced budget for the United States and is therefore not germane to that part of the legislation before us. Title III of the legislation provides for U.S. contributions to the IMF, as well as certain conditions and restric- tions of those contributions and on lending by U.S. banks. The title does not address the far broader issues of overall Federal Government spending and taxing raised by this amendment. The amendment also has a different fundamental purpose from title III, in that it seeks to impose limitations on aggregate receipts and expenditures of the Federal Government, which has nothing to do with the purposes of the IMF legislation. The mere fact that previous non- germane amendments dealing with budget outlays and receipts have been attached to IMF legislation in past Congresses does not make the amend- ment germane. The amendment must be germane to the bill, not to the un- derlying law being amended in the bill. Deschler's Procedure, chapter 28, section 27. I ask the Chair to rule the amend- ment out of order. ... MR. W ALKER : Mr. Chairman, the amendment that I have placed before the House relates precisely to the law to which this particular piece of legis- lation speaks. And let me also cite Deschler's Procedure. Deschler's Proce- dure, 28.55, says that a bill amending several sections of an existing law may be sufficiently comprehensive to permit amendments which are germane to other sections of that law. That is precisely what I am doing here. The language of this amendment VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01496 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

8877AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 Donald J. Pease (Ohio).relates to balanced budget language that is in the present law. This bill amends several sections of that law. So, therefore, this particular amend- ment is entirely germane to that which is before us. Deschler's Procedure also says, in section 28.57, to a bill amending a law dealing with several subjects within a definable class, an amendment further amending that law to add another sub- ject within the same class is germane. This again is the same subject area. We have balanced budget language which exists in the present law. This is in the same class. So, therefore, it seems to me that under precedents of the House it is entirely germane to the bill that we are considering. THECHAIRMAN :(20)The Chair is pre- pared to rule on the point of order. Although the balanced budget provi- sion of law which would be amended by this amendment was originally added to the Bretton Woods Agreement Act as a nongermane Senate amend- ment in the 95th Congress and was subsequently amended in a similar bill in the 96th Congress, the pending bill does not relate to the entire Federal budget. The Chair rules that the amendment must be germane to the pending bill, it not being sufficient that the amend- ment relate to a nongermane provision of a law being amended by the pending bill. Therefore, the Chair sustains the point of order. Mr. Walker then offered a fur- ther amendment: MR. W ALKER : Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Walk- er: On page 28, after line 8, add the following: Sec. 308. Consistent with the ob- jective of sustaining worldwide eco- nomic growth and recovery set forth in this title, Congress reaffirms its commitment to the mandates re- quired under section 7 of Public Law 95±435, the Bretton Woods Agree- ments Act Amendments of ... MR. STGERMAIN : Mr. Chairman, I raise a point of order against the amendment. ... [T]he amendment relates to a bal- anced budget for the United States and is therefore not germane to that part of the legislation before us. Title III of the legislation provides for U.S. con- tributions to the IMF, as well as cer- tain conditions and restrictions on those contributions and on lending by U.S. banks. The title does not address the far broader issues of overall Fed- eral Government spending and taxing raised by this amendment. The amendment also has a different fundamental purpose from title III, in that it seeks to impose limitations on aggregate receipts and expenditures of the Federal Government, which has nothing to do with the purposes of the IMF legislation. The mere fact that previous non- germane amendments dealing with budget outlays and receipts have been attached to IMF legislation in past Congresses does not make this amend- ment germane. The amendment must be germane to the bill, not to the un- derlying law being amended in the bill. Deschler's, chapter 28, section 27. I ask the Chair to rule the amend- ment out of order. ...

8878DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 H.R. 6778 (Committee on Banking and Currency). 115 C ONG. R EC. 33141, 91st Cong. 1st Sess., Nov. 5, 1969. Id. at p. 33142.MR. W ALKER : Mr. Chairman, in the case of this amendment, it does two things. No. 1, it speaks to exactly the same kinds of issues that were in- volved in amendment language that was added in the committee to the bill dealing with apartheid. This particular language simply says that consistent with the objectives sustaining world- wide economic growth and recovery set forth in the titleÐso it relates directly to the title of the bill under consider- ation. We are reaffirming the process of the law that was previously decided by this Congress. This simply reaffirms section 7 of Public Law 95-435 which already exists. This is a different amendment from the previous one. The precedent cited by the gentlemanÐI could agree with the ChairÐapplied to the previous amendment. In this case, though, the amendment language is specifically consistent with the title under consideration, and I think that the amendment is entirely germane to the bill that we are considering. THECHAIRMAN : The Chair rules that the issues raised with this amendment are fundamentally the same as those raised by the previous amendment. The issues are not germane to the bill at hand, and the point of order is sus- tained. Bill and Amendment Affecting Definitions of Terms in Bank Holding Company Act §35.49 To a bill amending two sections of the Bank Holding Company Act to, first, rede- fine ``bank holding company'' to include companies having actual control of any bankand, second, exempt from the definition of such term cer- tain institutions controlling banks engaged primarily in foreign business, an amend- ment to a third section of the act to change the definition of the word ``company'' to in- clude partnerships was held to be germane. In the 91st Congress, a bill(1) was under consideration amend- ing the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. During consideration of the bill, an amendment had been offered as follows,(2)and sub- sequently adopted: G5(3) Amendment offered by Mr. [Thomas L.] Ashley [of Ohio]: , strike lines 18 through 21 and insert in lieu thereof the following: (b) Section 2(a) of the Bank Hold- ing Company Act of 1956 is amended to read as follows: ``Sec. 2. (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (5) of this subsection, `bank holding company' means any company that has control over any bank or over any company that is or becomes a bank holding company by virtue of this Act. ``(2) Any given person has control. ``(A) over any company which is a corporation if the person . .. has power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of that corporation.

(c) Section 4(c) of the Bank Hold- ing Company Act of 1956 is amended by adding at the end thereof the fol- lowing new paragraph: ``(12) . .. activities conducted by any company organized under the laws of a foreign country the greater part of whose business is conducted outside the United States, if the Board . .. determines that . .. the exemption would not be substan- tially at variance with the purposes of this Act. ...'' In explaining the amendment, the proponent had stated:(4) Mr. Chairman, this amendment is concerned with the criteria for deter- mining whether or not a company is a bank holding company for purposes of the 1956 act, as amended. The bill be- fore us, H.R. 6778, defines a bank holding company as any company that directly or indirectly owns or controls 25 percent or more of the voting shares of any bank. ... Testimony before our committee in- dicated that in some instances compa- nies might seek to avoid coverage of the act by keeping their stock owner- ship at less than 25 percent. My amendment simply modifies H.R. 6778 by providing that actual control of any bank, even at less than 25 percent, is sufficient to require the controlling company to register as a bank holding company. ... Second, Mr. Chairman, my amend- ment makes it clear, subject to action by the Federal Reserve Board, that noforeign institution will be a bank hold- ing company by virtue of its ownership or control of any bank the greater part of whose business is conducted outside the United States. ... After adoption of the Ashley amendment, the following amend- ment was offered to the bill:(5) Amendment offered by Mr. [Chalmers P.] Wylie [of Ohio]: , immediately after line 21, insert the following: (c) Section 2(b) of the Bank Hold- ing Company Act of 1956 is amended (A) by inserting ``partnership,'' imme- diately after ``corporation,'', (B) by striking ``(1)'', and (C) by striking ``, or (2) any partnership''. ... A point of order was raised against the amendment, as fol- lows: MR. [T HOMAS M.] R EES [of Cali- fornia]: Mr. Chairman, the amendment is out of order as it is not germane to the bill now before us. The bill before us is in the form of one committee amendment. The committee amend- ment deals with section 2(a) of the Bank Holding Company Act. It then on line 22 proceeds to jump to section 4(c) of the Bank Holding Act. The amend- ment offered by the gentleman from Ohio goes to 2(b) and there is no men- tion in the bill before us of section 2(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act. In defense of the amendment, the proponent stated as follows: MR. W YLIE: Mr. Chairman, the prin- ciple is well established that in passing on the germaneness of an amendment, VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01499 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

8880DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 Chet Holifield (Calif.).the Chair considers the relationship of the amendment to the bill as modified by the Committee of the Whole at the time the amendment is offered, and not as originally referred to the com- mitteeÐCannon's Procedure, page 200. Mr. Chairman, in the light of this principle, the attention of the Chair is respectfully directed to the present sta- tus of the committee amendment, which under the rule is considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. The Committee of the Whole has adopted, among others, the Ashley amendment, which completely rewrites the definition of ``bank holding company'' in the Bank Holding Com- pany Act. It is obvious that the legal signifi- cance of the definition of ``bank holding company'' depends in turn on the defi- nition of ``company.'' It is equally obvi- ous that a change in the definition of ``company'' will, to that extent, modify the definition of ``bank holding com- pany.'' My amendment, Mr. Chairman, amends the definition of ``company'' so as to include partnerships. I think it is clear, Mr. Chairman, that my amend- ment thereby modifies the definition of ``bank holding company''Ðindeed, Mr. Chairman, this is its principal purpose. By adopting the Ashley amendment, the Committee of the Whole nec- essarily made in order any amendment proposing a germane modification of the bill as so amended, in accord with the principle which I stated at the be- ginning of my remarks. ... The Chairman,(6)in ruling on the point of order, stated:...The fact that there was no point of order raised to the Ashley amendment allowed the Ashley amend- ment to be considered and adopted by the committee and that changed the tenor of the bill to the extent that the language therein be changed, and the committee amendment now under con- sideration amends sections 2(a) and 4(c) of the act. These two sections, and the amendment proposed to them, are unrelated. The committee report on the pending bill discloses that the com- mittee amendment does two things: Subjects single bank holding compa- nies to the 1956 act and changes the existing law with respect to what par- ticular nonbanking activities are pro- hibited to them. It is a well-established principle of the germaneness rule that where a bill amends existing law in two or more unrelated respects, other amendments to that law may be germane. ... Section 2(b) of existing law . . . de- fines the word ``company'' as it is used in the term ``bank holding company'' and elsewhere in the act. ... Since the committee amendment amends two provisions of existing law and opened up for consideration the meaning of the term ``bank holding company,'' . . . words within or depend- ent upon that term, even if defined elsewhere in the act, are also subject to interpretation and definition. The Chair holds the amendment ger- mane and overrules the point of order.

During consideration of H.R. 7(7)in the Committee of the Whole on July 20, 1979,(8)a point of order was conceded and sus- tained against the amendment de- scribed above. The proceedings were as follows: Sec. 3. (a) Section 19(a) of the Fed- eral Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461) is amended (1) by changing ``member bank'' to read ``depository institu- tion'' each place it appears therein, and (2) by adding at the end thereof the following: ``The Board shall exer- cise its authority to define the term `deposit' when applicable to reserve requirements of nonmember deposi-tory institutions after consultation with the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora- tion, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and the National Credit Union Administration.''. .. MR. [J AMES A.] M ATTOX [of Texas]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Mattox: Add a new section: Sec. 8. Section 5136 of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 24(7)) is amend- ed by inserting before the period at the end thereof the following: ``: Pro- vided further, That, notwithstanding any other provision of this para- graph, the association may purchase for its own account shares of stock of a bank insured by the Federal De- posit Insurance Corporation if the stock of such bank is owned exclu- sively by other banks and if such bank is engaged exclusively in pro- viding banking services for other banks and their officers, directors, or employees, but in no event shall the total amount of such stock held by the association exceed at any time 10 per centum of its capital stock and paid in and unimpaired surplus, and in no event shall the purchase of such stock result in the association's acquiring more than 5 per centum of any class of voting securities of such bank''. ... MR. [C HALMERS P.] W YLIE [of Ohio]: ... The amendment is clearly not ger- mane to this bill. I might say I have some sympathy with the gentleman's amendment, but it is a rather com- plicated amendment which ought to be debated more fully than we have time here today to do, in my judgment.

THECHAIRMAN : The gentleman con- cedes the point of order. The point of order is sustained. Deposit Insurance CoverageÐ Amendment Imposing Max- imum Interest and Dividend Rates Payable §35.51 To a proposition to amend existing law in one particular, an amendment to further change that law in another respect not covered by the bill is not germane; thus, to a bill limited in scope to the amount and ex- tent of deposit insurance coverage in various savings institutions, an amendment imposing uniform maximum interest or dividend rates which may be paid by those savings institutions was held not germane. On Feb. 5, 1974,(10)during con- sideration of H.R. 11221 (amend- ing the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) in the Committee of theWhole, the Chair sustained a point of order against the fol- lowing amendment: MR. [A LBERT W.] J OHNSON of Penn- sylvania: Mr. Chairman, I offer amend- ments. The Clerk read as follows: Amendments offered by Mr. John- son of Pennsylvania: On page 3, strike the quotation mark at the end of line 17, and insert the following after line 17: ``(C) In order to provide for the equality of interest or dividend rates, terms and conditions on deposits or investments in insured banks or in- sured institutions made by any de- positor referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Corpora- tion, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, shall, in the event that limitations on interest or dividend rates are im- posed on such deposits or invest- ments, issue uniform regulations specifying maximum interest or divi- dend rates which may be paid on such deposits or investments made under the same terms and condi- tions.''. .. MR. [F ERNAND J.] S TGERMAIN [of Rhode Island]: . .. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the so- called Johnson amendment to H.R. This section merely provides full Federal insurance on such funds placed in financial institutions, and re- stricts itself to that. The amendment before us speaks to the question of what interest rates may be offered to such funds and, therefore, is not germane since it is be- yond the scope of the legislation con- tained in H.R. 11221, as well as this particular section.

8883AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 Spark Matsunaga (Hi.).MR. JOHNSON of Pennsylvania: . .. Mr. Chairman, I rise to defend the amendment against the point of order raised by the gentleman from Rhode Island. The amendment is indeed ger- mane to the fundamental purpose of the bill before us today. On its face, the bill provides full insurance of the deposits of public units in all insured banks and institutions. As such, it is designed and intended to make a basic change in the relationships between the financial institutions which are regulated by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora- tion, and the Federal Home Loan Bank BoardÐthe intention is to redistribute the deposits among these institutions. In the bill, the primary method for achieving this redistribution is through the provision of insurance. Whereas, public deposits are presently limited for all practical purposes to commercial banks, which can supplement their ac- count insurance with the protection af- forded by the pledging of collateral to secure these public depositsÐand this pledging is required in most instances by State lawÐthe thrust of the pend- ing legislation is to enable thrift insti- tutions, savings and loan associations, and mutual savings banks in par- ticular, to accept these public deposits. My amendment would only serve to modify these terms and conditions under which the deposits of public funds would be accepted by the finan- cial institutions involved. The same fundamental purpose would be sought by amendment as by the bill itself, that of regulating the flow of public funds between these institutions. ... It is claimed that the difference in terms on its face makes my amend- ment nongermane, since the bill dealswith insurance of deposits, and my amendment deals with the interest or dividends payable on those deposits. However, I must insist that the pur- pose and thrust be examined, rather than just the language. The reason for extending full insur- ance of these deposits is to influence the custodians of these public funds in their decisions as to where they will be depositedÐthat is the stated purpose of this bill, as reported by the Banking and Currency Committee and as dis- cussed here on the House floor today. In no way does my amendment de- part from this same fundamental pur- poseÐit seeks to use the powers of the same regulatory agencies to influence the same deposits of the same public depositors in the same institu- tions. ... THECHAIRMAN :(11)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. The gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. St Germain) makes the point of order that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Johnson) is not germane to the bill H.R. 11221. . . . The pending bill provides for full de- posit insurance coverage for deposits of public funds in various types of sav- ings institutions without regard to the existing $20,000 ceiling, and provides for an increase in the present $20,000 ceiling on deposit insurance for indi- vidual accounts to $50,000. The bill is thus limited in scope to the question of amount and extent of deposit insur- ance. The proposed amendment provides that in order to assure equality of in- VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01503 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

On September 8, 1966, Chairman Boland, the gentleman from Massachu- setts, held that to a substitute amend- ment amending several banking acts relating to interest rates, and amend- ing one subsection of the Federal De- posit Insurance Act, an amendment proposing further modifications to the latter act to increase the insurance coverage on deposits was not germane. In that case, the Chair, citing ``Can- non's Precedents'' (VIII, 2937), stated that where it is proposed to amend ex- isting law in one particular, an amend- ment to amend the law in another re- spect not covered by the bill is not ger- mane. Accordingly, the Chair is constrained to sustain the point of order. Bill Amending Internal Rev- enue Code To Provide Tax CreditsÐSenate Amendment Authorizing Payments to So- cial Security Recipients §35.52 To a House bill con- taining several diverse amendments to the Internal Revenue Code to provide in- dividual and business tax credits, that part of a Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute contained in aconference report which au- thorized appropriations for special payments to social se- curity recipients was deemed not to be related to tax ben- efit provisions in the Inter- nal Revenue Code and was held to be not germane. On Mar. 26, 1975,(12)during consideration of the conference re- port on H.R. 2166,(13)it was held that to a proposition seeking to re- duce tax liabilities of individuals and businesses by providing di- verse tax credits within the Inter- nal Revenue Code, an amendment to provide rebates to recipients under retirement and survivor benefit programs was not ger- mane.

MR. [B ARBER B.] C ONABLE [Jr., of New York]: I make a point of order against the conference report on the ground that it contains matter which is in violation of clause 7, rule XVI. The nongermane matter I am specifi- cally referring to is that section of the report dealing with a rebate to social security recipients. This section ap- pears as section 702 of the conference report on page 55. ... There is clearly nothing in the House bill dealing with social security mat- ters. There is nothing relating to a trust fund or the relationship of trust fund and general fund. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that this . .. is clearly outside the scope of the House bill. ... MR. [A L] ULLMAN [of Oregon]: . . . In the House-passed bill there was a pro-vision very specifically rebating funds to individuals under title I. The meas- ure included in this conference report does not affect the trust fund in any way. It does not in any way amend the Social Security Code. In the statement of the managers we say the following: The conferees emphasize that these payments are not Social Secu- rity benefits in any sense, but are in- tended to provide to the aged, blind, and disabled a payment comparable in nature to the tax rebate which the bill provides to those who are work- ing. Therefore, in a broadly based bill such as this kind, where various kinds of rebates are passed along to different segments of the public, it seems to me that this is perfectly within the scope of the bill and should be determined germane to the bill. . . . THESPEAKER :(14)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. Title V of the Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute ``Miscella- neous Provisions'' contained sections which did not amend the Internal Rev- enue Code and which could not be con- sidered germane to any portion of the House-passed bill or the bill as a whole. Specifically, section 501 of the Senate amendment providing a special payment to recipients of benefits under certain retirement and survivor benefit programs, a modification of which was incorporated into section 702 of the conference report, is not germane to the House-passed bill. That provision is not related to the Internal Revenue Code and would provide an authoriza- tion of appropriations from the Treas- ury.

ÐSenate Amendment Limiting Use of Foreign Tax Credits §35.54 Where a bill amends ex- isting law relating to a cer-tain subject in several di- verse respects, additional amendments germane to that subject may be germane to the bill. To a House bill containing sev- eral sections amending diverse portions of the Internal Revenue Code to provide certain individual and business tax credits, a new section of a Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute con- tained in a conference report, which added a new section to the House bill and which dealt with earnings and profits of controlled foreign corporations and included limitations on the use of foreign tax credits from foreign oil-related income was held germane. The proceedings of Mar. 26, 1975,(18) were as follows: SEC. 602. T AXATION OFEARNINGS AND PROFITS OF CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS AND THEIR SHARE - HOLDERS .

LIMITATION ON FOREIGN TAX CREDIT FOR TAXES PAID IN CONNECTION WITH FOREIGN OIL AND GAS INCOME House bill.ÐNo provision. Senate amendment.ÐThe Senate amendment repeals the foreign tax credit on all foreign oil-related income and allows any taxes on that income as a deduction. The amendment also pro- vides that foreign oil-related income is to be taxed at a 24-percent rate. Conference substitute.ÐThe con- ference substitute modifies the Senate amendment and applies a strict limita- tion on the use of foreign tax credits from foreign oil extraction income and foreign oil-related income. . . . MR. [W ILLIAM A.] S TEIGER of Wis- consin: Mr. Speaker, I make a point of order against the conference report on the ground that it contains matter which is in violation of the provisions of clause 7 of rule XVI. The non- germane matter that I am specifically referring to is that section of the report dealing with taxation of earnings andprofits of controlled foreign corpora- tions and their shareholders in section 602 as reported by the committee of conference. . . . As the Speaker well knows, I am sure, from listening carefully to the ex- planations regarding previous points of order, at no point during the consider- ation of the House-passed bill is there any mention of foreign taxation and the dealings of foreign taxes insofar as American corporations and their sub- sidiaries are concerned. Title I of the 1975 tax bill dealt with the refund for 1974 taxes. Title II dealt with reductions in individual income taxes. Title III dealt with certain changes in business taxes, the title which dealt with the investment tax credit or income tax total, particularly as related to small businesses. This particular provision, Mr. Speak- er, in no way deals with a matter that was covered, mentioned, or dealt with by the bill that is presented to the House, or voted upon by the House. ... MR. [A L] U LLMAN [of Oregon]: . .. Mr. Speaker, the bill that the House passed had a great many diverse sec- tions in it; it had credits. The matter that has been raised is an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code very clearly, and much of it is in the way of a credit. We have dealt with credits here both for individuals and for cor- porations in the bill that the House passed. It seems to me that in a bill of this scope and in a bill that deals as broad- ly with tax credits and matters such as this that does involve an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code, it is very clearly within the province of the bill, and should be ruled germane.

In the 82d Congress, a bill(20) was under consideration com- prising amendments to the Uni- versal Military Training and Serv- ice Act. The following amendment was offered to the bill:(1) Amendment offered by Mr. Poage: , strike out all of line 10through 17, inclusive, and insert in lieu thereof the following: (2) Within the limits of the overall military manpower needs of the United States and notwithstanding any other provision of law any per- son whether a citizen of the United States or of any friendly nation and any national of Western Germany or Japan who meets all the other quali- fications for service in the Armed Forces of the United States . .. shall be afforded an opportunity to volunteer for induction for service in the Armed Forces of the United States. ... A point of order was raised against the amendment, as follows: MR. [W. S TERLING ] C OLE [of New York]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment of- fered by the gentleman from Texas upon the ground that it indirectly af- fects the naturalization laws of the country which are not a part of the pending measure. In defense of the amendment, the proponent stated as follows: MR. [W ILLIAM R.] P OAGE [of Texas]: Mr. Chairman, this amendment simply changes the provisions under which persons may be taken into the armed services of the United States. The bill now provides that within certain limits persons of prescribed ages shall be given an opportunity to come into the service of the United States. We change those conditions and one of the limitations we impose is to say that no one shall become a citizen of the United States simply by virtue of this act.

The Chairman(7)sustained the point of order.

Price (Ill.).tleman from Montana goes far beyond the scope of the bill now before us and therefore sustains the point of order. Bill Amending Various Edu- cation ActsÐAmendment Making Principles of Civil Rights Act Applicable in Ad- ministration of Programs §35.57 To a bill amending var- ious education acts and pro- viding new authorizations for education grants to states, an amendment de- signed to insure that admin- istration of programs author- ized by the bill or amended acts conform to principles es- tablished by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was held to be germane. In the 90th Congress, during consideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Amendments of 1967,(9)the fol- lowing amendment was of- fered:(10) Amendment offered by Mrs. [Edith S.] Green of Oregon: On page 44, after line 8, insert the following: ADMINISTRATION Sec. 2. Rules . .. guidelines, or other published interpretations or orders issued by the Department ofHealth, Education, and Welfare or the United States Office of Edu- cation . .. affecting . .. administra- tion of programs authorized by this Act or by any Act amended by this Act shall contain immediately fol- lowing each substantive provision of such rules . .. citations to the . .. statutory law upon which such provi- sion is based. All such rules . .. guidelines, interpretations, or orders shall be uniformly applied and en- forced throughout the fifty States. A point of order was raised against the amendment, as fol- lows: MR. [B YRON G.] R OGERS [of Colo- rado]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment which has been offered by the gentlewoman from Oregon [Mrs. Green], based upon the proposition that the gentlewoman makes references to rules and regula- tions promulgated pursuant to titles IV and VI of the Civil Rights Act. And then she goes into a question of guidelines. . .. [T]he reference to guidelines is not an amendment to any piece of legislation that is being consid- ered by us at this time, and therefore is out of order and not germane. The Chairman,(11)in ruling on the point of order, stated: The Chair would like to point out that this amendment is specifically, by the language contained therein, di- rected toward the administration of programs authorized by this act, or by any act amended by this act. The Chair therefore overrules the point of order. VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01511 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

A bill to amend the Higher Edu- cation Act of 1965.Bill Amending Higher Edu- cation LawsÐAmendment To Prohibit Student Admission Quotas in All Schools §35.58 To a bill amending the General Education Provi- sions Act in one narrow re- spect relating to higher edu- cation, an amendment to that Act prohibiting the imposi- tion of student admission quotas not only in institu- tions of higher education but also in public preschool, ele- mentary and secondary pro- grams was held more general in scope and not germane. On May 12, 1976,(12)during con- sideration of H.R. 12851(13)in the Committee of the Whole, the Chair, in sustaining a point of order against an amendment, held that to a bill amending and ex- tending various laws relating to higher education, an amendment imposing restrictions on pre- school, elementary and secondary education policy broadened the scope of the bill and was not ger- mane. Amendment offered by Mr. Eshle- man: On page 86, line 25, insert ``(a)'' immediately after ``Sec. 202''.On page 87, immediately after line 7, insert the following new subsection: (b) Section 440 of the General Edu- cation Provisions Act is amended by in- serting ``(a)'' immediately after ``Sec. 440'' and adding at the end thereof the following new subsection: ``(b) It shall be unlawful for the Sec- retary to require the imposition of quotas, goals, or any other numerical requirements on the student admission practice of a State or local educational agency or institution of higher edu- cation, community college school, agen- cy offering a pre-school program, or other educational institution receiving Federal funds, whether directly or in- directly, under any provision of law, and funds shall not be deferred or lim- ited on the basis of failure to comply with such numerical require- ments.'' ... MR. [F RANK ] THOMPSON [Jr., of New Jersey]: Mr. Chairman, I make the point of orderÐI respectfully regret that I must do so, I will say to my friend from PennsylvaniaÐthat the amendment is nongermane. Mr. Chairman, this is a higher edu- cation bill. While a very few of these provisions may have an impact on sec- ondary schools, it is entirely indirect. The great majority of the bill, more than 90 percent, is in higher education. As a matter of fact, 100 percent of it is. This can only be characterized as a higher education bill. The gentleman's amendment deals with the admissions practices of ele- mentary and secondary schools, and even preschools. That subject matter is completely foreign to the subject mat- ter of the bill. I repeat, it is a higher education bill.

8893AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 James C. Wright, Jr. (Tex.).15.A bill to amend the Higher Edu- cation Act of 1965. 122 C ONG. REC. 13530, 94th Cong. 2d Sess.The gentleman's amendment, by reaching out to admissions policies of preschool, elementary and secondary schools, goes too far and is, therefore, not germane. There is one amendment in the bill, Mr. Chairman, of the Gen- eral Education Provision Act which the gentleman's amendment attempts to amend. Here too, however, the com- mittee bill is exclusively a higher edu- cation bill. The committee amendment to the General Education Provisions Act pro- poses a 1-year extension of the ``fund for the improvement of postsecondary education.'' This is the only way the committee bill amends the general education provisions at all. Further, Mr. Chairman, the amend- ment deals with the institution for re- ceiving Federal funds directly or indi- rectly under any provision of law. Mr. Chairman, I repeat that under any provision of law, this is beyond the limited scope of the bill. ... MR. [E DWIN D.] E SHLEMAN [of Penn- sylvania]: Mr. Chairman, I would just point out to the Chair that I submitted this amendment under section 202, which is opening section 404 of the General Education Provisions Act, which I think we have amended on oc- casion before in this House, because we are under the provision of general edu- cation. ... THECHAIRMAN :(14)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. The committee amendment clearly refers to higher education and, with only extremely narrow exceptions, con- tains no matter that would substan- tially relate to other programs. On the other hand, the amendment offered by the gentleman from Penn-sylvania (Mr. Eshleman) contains a prohibition against certain require- ments with respect to admission poli- cies by the language of the amend- ment, ``. ..a State or local edu- cational agency,'' or further by the lan- guage of the amendment, ``. ..agency offering a pre-school program,'' or, in even broader language contained in the amendment, ``. ..other edu- cational institution receiving Federal fundsÐunder any provision of law.'' Under the circumstances, the Chair is persuaded that the amendment as drafted is not germane to the bill be- fore the committee and, therefore, the Chair sustains the point of order. ÐAmendment To Prohibit Stu- dent Admission Quotas in Higher Education Programs §35.59 To a bill amending and extending various laws relat- ing to higher education, a further amendment to one of those laws prohibiting the imposition of student admis- sion quotas in applicable higher education programs was held germane as within the category of laws being amended by the bill.

Wright, Jr. (Tex.).order against an amendment to that bill, demonstrated that, to a bill comprehensively amending several laws within the same class, an amendment further amending one of those laws on a subject within that same class is germane. MR. [E DWIN D.] E SHLEMAN [of Penn- sylvania]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Eshle- man: On page 86, line 25, insert ``(a)'' immediately after ``Sec. 202''. On page 87, immediately after line 7, insert the following new sub- section: (b) Section 440 of the General Education Provisions Act is amended by inserting ``(a)'' immediately after ``Sec. 440'' and adding at the end thereof the following new subsection: ``(b) It shall be unlawful for the Secretary to require the imposition of quotas, goals, or any other numer- ical requirements on the student ad- mission practice of an institution of higher education, community college receiving Federal funds, whether di- rectly or indirectly, under any appli- cable programs, and funds shall not be deferred or limited on the basis of failure to comply with such numer- ical requirements.'' MR. [F RANK ] THOMPSON [Jr., of New Jersey]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment. ... Mr. Chairman, the fact is that there remains language in the gentleman's amendment which says, ``. ..under any provisions of law, and funds shall not be deferred or limited on the basis of failure to comply with such numer- ical requirements.''The fact that the entire scope of the act is quoted, and ``. ..any provision of law'' still remains in, I would insist, Mr. Chairman, makes it not germane to the legislation to which it is ad- dressed. ... MR. E SHLEMAN : Mr. Chairman, I would first point out, respectfully, that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Thompson) is incorrect. I did not leave in ``under any provision of law.'' I changed it to ``under any applicable programs.'' And that original termi- nology is not in there, as the gen- tleman stated. I have attemptedÐ maybe, let me say, in Pennsylvania DutchÐto limit this to institutions of higher education. ... THECHAIRMAN :(17)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. The Chair has very carefully re- viewed the changes made by the gen- tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Eshle- man) in the language contained in the amendment as originally offered. The Chair observes that the amendment presently before the Committee is lim- ited in its scope to institutions of high- er education or community colleges, and that it applies only to those insti- tutions of higher education and com- munity colleges which receive Federal funds under any applicable program. The Chair believes that the amend- ment as presently drafted before the Committee is germane to the bill, and the point of order is overruled. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Eshleman) in support of his amendment.

Section 403(3) of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, Eighty-first Congress), is amended to read as follows: ``(3) The term `parent' means any parent, stepparent, legal guardian, or other individual standing in loco parentis, whose income from employ- ment on Federal property is more than 50 percent of the total com- bined income of such individual and the spouse of such individual.''. Points of order against the amendment were reserved and subsequently discussed by Mr. Carl D. Perkins, of Kentucky, and Mr. Gerald R. Ford, of Michigan: MR. PERKINS : I insist on the point of order. This is an impact amendment and we have already passed that title. THECHAIRMAN : Is that the position of the gentleman from Michigan? MR. FORD: Yes, Mr. Chairman. I in- sist on the point of order. I did not press the point of order before the gen- tleman had an opportunity to explain what he was trying to do. I think his motives are fine, but I disagree with the result it would have. I wanted him to have an opportunity to do that; but clearly his amendment comes too late, since we have already concluded title III of the act which dealt with impact aid.

Amendment Not Confined to Law Under Consideration; Restrictions Imposed Under ``This or Any Other Act'' §35.62 To a bill amending an existing law, an amendment prohibiting assistance under that Act or under any other Act for a particular purpose was held too general in scope, affecting laws not being amended by the bill and was ruled out as not ger- mane.

The Chair sustains the point of order. §35.63 To a title of a bill pri- marily amending the Foreign Assistance Act reported from the Committee on Foreign Affairs to authorize assist- ance for Africa (containing one reference to another law, the Export-Import Bank Act, not directly amended and also within the jurisdiction of another committee), an amendment restricting the availability of funds in that bill ``or any other Act'' to sup- port the activities of the Afri- can National Congress was held to be not germane. During consideration of H.R. 3100(4)in the Committee of the Whole on Dec. 9 and 10, 1987,(5)it was held that to a bill amending an existing law to authorize a pro- gram, an amendment restricting authorizations under that or any other Act is not germane. The pro- ceedings were as follows:TITLE VIII ÐAFRICA PARTAÐA FRICA FAMINE RECOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE .

8899AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 Les AuCoin (Ore.).(a) Prohibition.ÐNone of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this or any other Act may be used to sup- port, directly or indirectly, activities of the African National Congress. (b) Waiver.ÐSubsection (a) may be waived by the President if he cer- tifies to the Congress thatÐ (1) the National Executive Com- mittee of the African National Con- gress has taken a stand publicly and officially opposing the practice of ``necklacing'', the practice of execu- tion by fire, used against South Afri- can blacks. ... (3) the African National Congress no longer receives its primary finan- cial, military, and training support from the Soviet Union or other Com- munist countries listed in section 620(f) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. ... MR. [M ICKEY ] L ELAND [of Texas]: Mr. Chairman, I raise a point of order against the amendment. ... The point of order has to do with germaneness, Mr. Chairman. The gen- tleman's amendment goes a lot farther beyond the purview of the responsi- bility of the Foreign Affairs Com- mittee, and thus also the parameters of the bill itself that we are debating here. It reaches the interest of other agencies that are not within the juris- diction of the consideration of this leg- islation at this time, and therefore it is nongermane to the arguments that we pursue here today. Also, Mr. Chairman, the amendment that the gentleman has offered goes a lot farther than any other amendment that has been offered here today. It is much broader, the scope of which is too far reaching to be relevant to the dis- cussions we have here today under the foreign aid bill. ... THECHAIRMAN :(6)The Chair is pre- pared to rule.The Chair would state that accord- ing to the Procedures of the House, and quoting from section 8, chapter 28, the following: ... a bill authorizing appropria- tions for a particular program for 10 fiscal years, an amendment restrict- ing authorizations under any act of Congress for any fiscal year contin- gent upon implementation of a plan to reduce spending under the bill was held not germane as not con- fined to the bill under consideration. The Chair would note in reading that amendment of the gentleman from Indiana that the gentleman pro- vides a prohibition on funds appro- priated by this or any other act, and the Chair can find in no other instance in title VIII as amended where there is any similar prohibition. For that reason, the Chair would rule that the gentleman's amendment goes beyond the scope of title VIII and is not germane. Therefore, the point of order is sustained.

On June 26, 1984,(7)during con- sideration of H.R. 5490 (the Civil Rights Act of 1984), the Chair sustained a point of order against an amendment as described above: The Clerk read as follows: Sec. 2. (a) The matter preceding clause (1) of section 901(a) of the Education Amendments of 1972 (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``Act'') is amendedÐ (1) by striking out ``in'' the second time it appears; (2) by striking out ``the benefits of'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``bene- fits''; and (3) by striking out ``under any edu- cation program or activity receiving'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``by any education recipient of''.

MR. [W ILLIAM E.] D ANNEMEYER [of California]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Danne- meyer: On page 3, line 10, strike out ``paragraph'' and insert in lieu there- of ``paragraphs''. On page 3, line 25, strike out the close quotation marks and the period at the end thereof.

8901AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 Al Swift (Wash.).9.130 C ONG. REC. 18856, 18857, 98th Cong. 2d Sess.do not, as the policymaking body of this country, in terms of law, choose to take our society down the road where someone sooner or later is going to argue that the term ``sex'' in the law includes sexual preference or orienta- tion. I am not adding anything. I am just clarifying what that term means today as it is used in the law. THECHAIRMAN :(8)The Chair is pre- pared to rule on the point of order. The Committee's report indicates that the purpose of this legislation is to reaffirm the scope and the applica- tion of four civil rights laws to an in- terpretation which was generally ac- cepted before the Grove City College decision. It does not seek to define what is a discriminatory act. In other words, the bill deals with the definition of ``potential discrimina- tors,'' in this instance, recipients of Federal financial assistance. It does not deal with the definition of ``dis- crimination.'' Because the gentleman's amendment would address the definition of what constitutes discrimination, his amend- ment would not be in order. The Chair would cite Deschler's Pro- cedure, 28.2: To the proposition amending exist- ing law in several particulars but re- lating to a single subject affected thereby, an amendment proposing to modify the law but not related to the subject of the pending proposition is not germane. And in 28.4, Deschler continues: Similarly, if a bill seeks only to modify the penalty provisions of a law prescribing specific conduct, an amendment is not germane if itseeks to broaden the scope or alter the applicability of such law. Therefore, the Chair finds the gen- tleman's amendment not in order. ÐAmendment To Expand Defi- nition of Persons Who Are Subjects of Discrimination §35.65 To a bill amending a general law but only with re- spect to a specific issue, an amendment relating to terms of the law not amended by the bill, rather than to the issues contained in the bill, is not germane; thus, to a section of a bill amending the Age Discrimination Act only to clarify the definition of a discriminating entity subject to the penalties under that statute, an amendment to expand the definition of persons who are the subject of discrimination (to include the unborn) was ruled nongermane as beyond the scope of the bill.

(3) by adding at the end thereof the following new clause: ``(4) the term `recipient' meansÐ ``(A) any State or political subdivi- sion thereof, or any instrumentality of a State or political subdivision thereof, or any public or private agency, institution, or organization, or other entity (including any subunit of any such State, subdivi- sion, instrumentality, agency, insti- tution, organization, or entity), and ``(B) any successor, assignee, or transferee of any such State, subdivi- sion, instrumentality, agency, insti- tution, organization, or entity or of any such subunit, to which Federal financial assistance is extended (directly or through an- other entity or a person), or which receives support from the extension of Federal financial assistance to any of its subunits.''. ... MR. [M ARK] S ILJANDER [of Michi- gan]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amend- ment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Sil- jander: , after line 18, insert the following: (1) by inserting after ``person'', ``(including unborn children, from the moment of conception)''. ... MR. [P AUL] SIMON [of Illinois]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment. Again it is the same point of order that I made earlier. It is an attempt to add a totally new definition. Again we are dealing with the traditional defini- tions of race, national origin, sex, handicapped, and aged.This is a very legitimate issue to be brought before this body, but this is not the vehicle by which to do it. This is not the intent of it, and it does not fall within the germaneness of this particular bill. ... MR. SILJANDER : Mr. Chairman, one of the differences is that the word, ``person,'' is mentioned in the bill sev- eral times, whereas in the other point of order the word, ``sex,'' was not at all mentioned in the specific bill. THECHAIRMAN :(10)The Chair is pre- pared to rule on the point of order. This amendment amends a part of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 that is not before the committee. The bill has a very narrow purpose, and the gentleman's amendment does not fall within that purpose. The Chair would refer the gentleman to clause 7, rule XVI, the annotation of which reads: To a bill amending a general law on a specific point an amendment re- lating to the terms of the law rather than to those of the bill was ruled not to be germane; thus a bill amending several sections of one title of the United States Code does not necessarily bring the entire title under consideration so as to permit an amendment to any portion there- of, and where a bill amends existing law in one narrow particular, an amendment proposing to modify such existing law in other particu- lars will generally be ruled out as not germane. Unless a bill so exten- sively amends existing law as to open up the entire law to amend- ment, the germaneness of an amend- ment to the bill depends on its rela- tionship to the subject of the bill and not to the entire law being amended. The Chair finds the amendment not germane and, therefore, not in order. VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01522 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

8903AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 130 C ONG. R EC. 18857±62, 18864, 98th Cong. 2d Sess.ÐAmendment To Extend Cov- erage of Laws to Members of Congress §35.66 To a bill narrowly amending several civil rights statutes only to clarify the circumstances under which any institution currently re- ceiving federal financial as- sistance may have such as- sistance terminated because of discrimination by such in- stitution, an amendment to deem Members of Congress as recipients of federal finan- cial assistance for the pur- pose of those statutes was held not germane, since the amendment required no showing that Members of Congress do in fact receive federal financial assistance as defined in those statutes, and thus expanded the scope of coverage of the laws amended to a class unrelated to the group of institutions addressed in the bill and the laws amended. On June 26, 1984,(11)the Chair- man of the Committee of the Whole, in holding the amendment described above as not being ger- mane demonstrated that, to a bill having as its fundamental pur-pose the clarification of eligibility of existing recipients for federal fi- nancial assistance under several statutes, an amendment deeming a specified entity to be a recipient of federal financial assistance for the purposes of those laws was not germane since it expanded the scope of the coverage of the laws being amended to a class not nec- essarily covered by the class of re- cipients in the bill. The Clerk read as follows: Sec. 5. (a) Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``Act'') is amendedÐ ...

8904DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 MR. [S TEVE ] B ARTLETT [of Texas]: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk labeled amendment No. 1 which I offer at this time. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Bart- lett: , after line 22, insert the following: Sec. 6. With respect to matters re- lating to the performance of their of- ficial duties, Members of Congress shall be deemed to be recipients of Federal financial assistance for pur- poses of section 901 of the Education Amendments of 1972, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, sec- tion 303 of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ... MR. [P AUL] SIMON [of Illinois]: Mr. Chairman, I renew my point of order, and let me say in renewing it that in theory I am in agreement with the gentleman from Texas. I am a cospon- sor of a bill to cover Members of Con- gress under separate legislation. This, however, this legislation covers Federal executive agencies. It does not cover the U.S. Congress. ... What the gentleman is attempting to do is to go beyond the scope, beyond the germaneness of this particular leg- islation, and I believe the amendment is not in order. ... MR. BARTLETT : ... Several points. No. 1, section 504 does apply to execu- tive agencies, and that is the General Accounting Office. Congress may alreadyÐand let us take it point by pointÐthe Congress may already be covered in the bill's definition of recipient, which is, in part, ``any public or private agency, in- stitution, or organization to which Fed- eral financial assistance is ex- tended.'' ...Congress is also, obviously a recipi- ent and, therefore, if Congress receives ``Federal financial assistance'' it would be covered under H.R. 5490. Nowhere in any of the covered acts is there a specific definition of ``Federal financial assistance,'' but Mr. Chairman, Con- gress obviously must pay its bills from somewhere and that somewhere is the Federal Government, so that means that there is assistance. Federal finan- cial assistance. ... MR. S IMON : ... The question is whether the law up to this point has covered the legislative branch. The an- swer is clearly that it has not. So what the gentleman from Texas is doing is going appreciably beyond the present law and the law has not covered Congress for a perfectly sound reason, and that is the separation of powers. ... MR. [J AMES C.] W RIGHT [Jr., of Texas]: It seems to me that the point of order rests upon the well-established rule that an amendment is not ger- mane if it extends the law to cover an entirely separate and distinctly dif- ferent class of people than those whom the law in its initial presentation in the bill would be made applicable. It seems clear to me that the amend- ment offered by the gentleman would indeed extend the application of that statute to an entirely separate and dif- ferent class of people. ... MR. [J OHN] CONYERS [Jr., of Michi- gan]: . .. The amendment is not ger- mane. The separation of powers doc- trine, if we do not recognize it even here in this sensitive area, we would be inviting the Department of Justice to come in to enforce the civil rights laws.

For exam- ple, the House fair employment prac- tices agreement is one way of creating the mechanism. ... THE CHAIRMAN :(12)The Chair is ready to rule. In the bill the term ``recipient'' means those entities to which Federal assistance is extended. The gentleman's amendment deems Congress to be a recipient of Federal financial assistance. That does not mean that there may not be some in- stances in which Congress may in fact receive Federal financial assistance, but it deems Congress to receive Fed- eral financial assistance even without any showing whatever that in fact it has that financial assistance extended to it. Doing that expands the bill from de- fined group in the legislation and in the law today to a much different group and in that sense goes beyond the scope of the legislation, and the gentleman's amendment is not in order. Parliamentarian's Note: On a roll call vote of 277 yeas to 125 nays, the Committee of the Whole sustained on appeal the ruling of the Chair on the question of ger- maneness of the amendment. ÐAmendment To Define ``Per- son'' as Used in Bill To In- clude Unborn §35.67 An amendment defin- ing a term in a bill may be germane so long as it relatesto the bill and not to por- tions of laws being amended which are not the subject of the bill; thus, to a bill clari- fying the definition of per- sons or institutions which may have federal financial assistance terminated under several civil rights statutes because of discrimination, an amendment providing that the term ``person'' for the purpose of the bill shall in- clude unborn children was held germane. On June 26, 1984,(13)the Com- mittee of the Whole had under consideration H.R. 5490, the Civil Rights Act of 1984. The bill amended several laws for pur- poses of clarifying the definition of recipients of federal financial as- sistance (including persons) who engage in discrimination so as to become subject to the penalties of those laws. The amendment ex- panded the definition of recipient persons to include unborn chil- dren from the moment of concep- tion, but did not effectively ex- pand the definition of persons who are the objects of discrimination, whatever its intent may have been, a point which was noted in the remarks of Mr. Williams of Montana, below.

MR. [M ARK] S ILJANDER [of Michi- gan]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amend- ment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Sil- jander: , after line 22, insert the following: Sec. 6. For the purposes of this act, the term ``person'' shall include unborn children from the moment of conception. MR. [P AUL] SIMON [of Illinois]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment. ... It is an attempt to expand with a new definition beyond the scope of this act. It is not germane as the previous amendment was not germane. ... MR. SILJANDER : Chapter 28 of the procedures of the House, section 9.12, says ``. .. to a bill containing defini- tions of several of the terms used therein, an amendment modifying one of the definitions and adding another may be germane. On page 3, on page 6 and page 8 and page 10 the word ``person'' is used, which is substantially different from the former amendment. I yield to the chairman. THECHAIRMAN :(14)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. On page 8, line 24, the bill uses the term ``person.''In the gentleman's amendment he says for the purposes of this bill the term ``person'' shall, and defines the term ``person'' and, therefore, the amendment is germane. ... MR. [P AT] W ILLIAMS of Montana: Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the req- uisite number of words. I rise in oppo- sition to the amendment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If my in- formation is correct, the term ``person'' appears four times in this act and each time it appears, it refers to a person receiving or distributing Federal funds. Now, if I understand the gentleman's amendment, he is including children at the moment of conception as those re- ceiving or distributing Federal funds. What is the purpose of the amend- ment? The amendment is moot. Un- born children do not receive or dis- tribute Federal funds. The amendment has no meaning.

Wright, Jr. (Tex.).strued as a restriction on other programs under that Act not amended by the pending bill and was held to be not germane. On May 12, 1976,(15)during con- sideration of H.R. 12851(16)in the Committee of the Whole, the Chair sustained a point of order against an amendment holding that to a bill amending various laws relating primarily to higher education, an amendment to a law being amended by the bill, but af- fecting programs under that law dealing with other levels of edu- cation was beyond the scope of the pending bill and in violation of Rule XVI clause 7. MR. [J OHN B.] C ONLAN [of Arizona]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Conlan: On page 86, between lines 6 and 7, add the following new sub- section: ``(d) No grant, contract, or support is authorized under this Act for any educational program, curriculum re- search and development, adminis- trator-teacher orientation, or any project involving one or more stu- dents or teacher-administrator in- volving any aspect of the religion of secular humanism. ... MR. [J AMES G.] O'H ARA [of Michi- gan]: . .. The amendment as offeredsays, ``grant, contract, or support is au- thorized under this act,'' and in the context in which it is offered the gen- tleman from Arizona would apply it to all of the parts of the National Defense Education Act because he inserts it on page 86 between lines 6 and 7, which is all of it, as an amendment of section 603 of the National Defense Education Act. So he goes very considerably be- yond the scope of the provisions of the section he offers to amend or, for that matter, he goes beyond the scope of the higher education laws that are amend- ed by this particular bill. Therefore, his amendment is not germane. ... MR. CONLAN : ... I think the gen- tleman is construing it in a very un- necessary and narrow area, Mr. Chair- man. We are dealing here with the Na- tional Defense Education Act. We are dealing with an enlargement of it. We are dealing with a whole broadened area of financing as part of that whole act. I think the amendment is quite germane, and legal counsel has ad- vised us that it is. THECHAIRMAN :(17)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Arizona appears in sec- tion 201, all of which consists of an amendment to the National Defense Education Act of 1958. The material contained in the bill amends that act very narrowly only to the extent of pro- viding for specialists and persons trained in languages and foreign cul- tures. By contrast, the amendment of- fered by the gentleman from Arizona would appear to amend the totality of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 and impose its restrictions upon VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01527 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

For this reason the Chair believes that the amendment as drafted and of- fered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Conlan) expressly making ref- erence to ``no grant, contract, or sup- port as authorized under this act'', thereby referring to the National De- fense Education Act of 1958 and not to the pending bill, is beyond the scope of the bill and, therefore, not germane to the language of the bill. Fair Prices for HousingÐ Amendment To Prohibit Dis- crimination §35.69 To a bill adding a new title to the National Housing Act to insure availability of housing at fair prices, amendments to add a section to the act to prohibit, in the administration of the act, any discrimination on ac- count of race, creed, or the like were held not germane. In the 79th Congress, during consideration of a bill(18)relating to housing stabilization, the fol- lowing amendment was of- fered:(19) Amendment offered by Mr. Dirksen: On page 17, after line 6, insert a new section, as follows:Sec. 711. In the administration of the National Housing Act as amend- ed and the United States Housing Act of 1937 as amended and in mak- ing available the benefits of said acts as amended, there shall be no dis- crimination on account of race, creed, color, or national origin, and in addi- tion thereto maximum preferences and priorities shall be secured to vet- erans of World War II and their im- mediate families. Mr. Brent Spence, of Kentucky, made the point of order that the amendment was not germane to the bill. The Chairman,(20)in rul- ing on the point of order, stated: ... Obviously, the gentleman's amendment is much too broad to come within the purview of the pending bill. The amendment relates to the Na- tional Housing Act as amended, the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended. The point of order is sus- tained. Mr. Everett M. Dirksen, of Illi- nois, then offered the amendment, deleting the reference to the United States Housing Act of (1)Mr. Spence again raised a point of order. In defense of the amendment, Mr. Dirksen stated: Clearly, Mr. Chairman, the bill be- fore us is nothing more than an addi- tional developing of the National Hous- ing Act, it amends the entire act in many particulars.

The Chairman then stated: The gentleman's amendment would take in entirely different provisions of the Housing Act than that contained in the pending bill. The point of order is sustained. Amendment and Amendment Thereto Modifying Same Sec- tion of Law §35.70 Where an amendment to a bill proposes modifica- tion of a section of existing law in some respects, an amendment to the amend- ment may properly propose modification of the same sec- tion of the law in similar re- spects. In the 85th Congress, during consideration of a bill(2)to extend and amend laws relating to im- provement of housing, an amend- ment was offered(3)which in part related to authorization of pay- ments to parties in lieu of those moving expenses occasioned by certain urban projects. The amendment stated in part:(4) Sec. 302. Section 106(f)(2) of the Housing Act of 1949 is amended byadding at the end thereof the following new sentence: ``Such rules and regula- tions may include provisions author- izing payment to individuals and fami- lies of fixed amounts (not to exceed $100 in any case) in lieu of their re- spective reasonable and necessary moving expenses.'' An amendment offered to such amendment stated as follows:(5) Amendment offered by Mr. [Barratt] O'Hara of Illinois to the amendment of- fered by Mr. Talle: Amend section 302 to read as follows: Sec. 302. Section 106(f)(2) of the Housing Act of 1949 is amended (1) by striking out $2,000 and inserting in lieu thereof $3,000; and (2) by adding at the end thereof the fol- lowing sentence: Such rules and reg- ulations may include provisions au- thorizing the payment to individuals, families, and business concerns of fixed amounts not to exceed $100 in the case of an individual or family, or $3,000 in the case of any business concern in lieu of the respective rea- sonable and necessary moving ex- penses. The purpose of the amendment was explained as follows: MR. O'H ARA [of Illinois]: . .. It hap- pens that in the district that I rep- resent we have in the operation of the urban-renewal program the displace- ment of many long-established mer- chants. . .. It is not right that these small-business tenants should be forced to assume this burden when their moving is not for their own profit or convenience, but to the contrary. ...

For a similar ruling during pro- ceedings relating to H.R. 6659, see Sec. 35.71, infra.8.H.R. 6659 (Committee on Banking and Currency). 103 C ONG. REC. 6703, 85th Cong. 1st Sess., May 9, 1957. Id. at p. 6706.that is ruinously inadequate. We are asking that the amount be increased to $3,000 to be paid only in cases where the circumstances warrant. ... The following point of order was raised by Mr. Henry O. Talle, of Iowa, against the amendment: Mr. Chairman, the amendment of the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. O'Hara] is not germane to my amend- ment. As I understand his amendment ... it refers to basic law. His amend- ment, in order to be germane, would have to be germane to my amendment which is under consideration. The Chairman,(6)in ruling on the point of order, stated: Section 302 is an amendment of ex- isting law contained in section 106(f)(2) of the Housing Act of 1949. That lan- guage presumably is germane to sec- tion 106(f)(2). That being the case, the amendment opens the entire section of the basic law, section 106(f)(2), to amendment, which is the purpose, in part, of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. O'Hara]. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Chair that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois is ger- mane. The Chair overrules the point of order.(7) §35.71 To an amendment in the nature of a substitute, proposing, in part, modifica- tion of a section of the Hous-ing Act of 1949 relating to payments for certain ex- penses occasioned by urban renewal projects, a propo- sition to further amend such section by limiting specified construction to that needed for relocation of families dis- placed by urban renewal projects was held to be ger- mane. In the 85th Congress, during proceedings relating to a bill(8)to extend and amend laws concerned with the improvement of housing, an amendment in the nature of a substitute was under consider- ation which contained the fol- lowing provision:(9) Sec. 302. Section 106(f)(2) of the Housing Act of 1949 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new sentence: ``Such rules and regula- tions may include provisions author- izing payment to individuals and fami- lies of fixed amounts (not to exceed $100 in any case) in lieu of their re- spective reasonable and necessary moving expenses.''

A point of order was raised against the Fisher amendment, as follows:(11) MR. [A BRAHAM J.] M ULTER [of New York]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment, that it is not germane to the amendment before the House or the bill before the House or any part of the bill or the pending amendment. ... The amendment deals with public housing. There is no public housing in any part of this bill or in any part of the amendment to the bill.The Chairman(12)overruled the point of order, citing the principle that, ``an amendment to a par- ticular section may perhaps make in order another amendment to the section.''(13) Committee Jurisdiction as Test Where Amendments to Law Are Within Jurisdiction of Different Committees §35.72 Committee jurisdiction is a relevant test of germane- ness where the pending por- tion of the bill amends a law entirely within one commit- tee's jurisdiction and the proposed amendment amends a law within another committee's jurisdiction; thus, to a title of an omnibus housing bill amending a law within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Banking, Fi- nance and Urban Affairs to reauthorize rural housing loan and grant programs, an amendment to another law within the jurisdiction of the VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01531 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

Mr. Mapes responded that, ``[S]ection 1 of the law relates to appointment of employees and the fixing of their compensation, which is the section I am trying to amend.'' The Chairman then cited a prior ruling by Speaker Fred- erick H. Gillett, of Massachusetts, that, ``to a bill amendatory of an act in several particulars an amendment proposing to modify the act, but not relating to the bill (is not) germane,'' and held as fol- lows: It seems very clear to the Chair that the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Michigan does attempt to modify a section of the existing law, but it is not germane to this particular section of the bill. The point of order, therefore, is sustained.

The Court has ruled against segregation. Here we are authorizing this great appropriation, under which we are going to spend billions of dol- lars in every State in the Union. Yet, there are some States in which the Ne- groes are not going to have a chance to work and earn part of this money to pay the taxes to build the high- ways. ... ...

Diverse Amendments to Airport and Airway Development ActÐAmendment Adding New Title to Bill §35.78 A bill comprehensively amending several sections of existing law may be suffi- ciently broad in scope to admit as germane an amend- ment which is germane to another section of that law not amended by the bill; thus, to a bill containing sev- eral titles amending the Air- port and Airway Develop- ment Act in diverse respects, including provisions relating to aircraft noise reduction grants, regulation and fund- ing, general airport develop- ment projects, and general research, development and demonstration grants, an amendment adding a new title amending the Act to ex- tend the authorization for State Airport Demonstration Grants was held germane.On Sept. 14, 1978,(11)during consideration of H.R. 8729(12)in the Committee of the Whole, Chairman Gerry E.

R EC. 14868, 84th Cong. 2d Sess., July 26, 1956.section that is in the Airport and Air- way Development Act. We already have other titles in this bill dealing with the Airport and Airway Develop- ment Act, the so-called AADA. This deals with that part of the program and I think it is germane to the title of the bill. ... THECHAIRMAN : The Chair is pre- pared to rule. The bill before us amends the Air- port and Airway Development Act in several respects and with some depth and breadth. It deals not only with noise control, but planning, grants and research, and in other ways. Therefore, the Chair feels the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Harsha) is germane to the bill as a whole and the point of order is overruled. Tax Consequences of Sale of Property by Air CarriersÐDe- termination of Subsidies for Air Carriers §35.79 To a bill amending the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 in part to exclude from speci- fied tax computations those gains from the sale of prop- erty of an air carrier that are subsequently reinvested in similar property, an amend- ment was held to be not ger- mane which sought to relate such accounting procedures to the determination of cer- tain subsidies for air car- riers.In the 84th Congress, the fol- lowing proposition(13)was under consideration:(14) ... That section 406(b) of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, as amended (49 U.S.C. 486), is amended by insert- ing ``(1)'' after ``(b)'' and by adding at the end thereof the following: (2) In determining ``all other rev- enue'' of an air carrier for the pur- poses of paragraph (1), the BoardÐ (A) shall not take into account any loss on the sale or other disposition of property, and (B) shall not take into account any gain on the sale or other disposition of property, if the net gain (after ap- plicable taxes) is (within a reason- able time to be fixed and determined by the Board) reinvested in other property similar or related in service or use. For the purposes of this para- graph, the term ``property'' means depreciable property used or useful in the carrier's normal oper- ations. ... The following amendment was offered: Amendment offered by Mr. [John W.] Heselton [of Massachusetts]: , line 11, strike out all of lines 11 through 22, inclusive, and insert in place thereof the following: ...

Mr. Oren Harris, of Arkansas, in making a point of order against the amendment, stated, ``The amendment . .. goes far beyond the scope of this bill.'' In defend- ing the amendment, the pro- ponent, Mr. Heselton stated: ...I would like to refer . .. to a ruling . .. found in Cannon's Prece- dents, section 2993. . .. It is as fol- lows: An amendment to a section which is relevant to the subject matter and which may be said to be properly and logically suggested in the per- fecting of the section and the car- rying out of the intent of the bill would be germane to the bill and thus is in order. The Chairman,(15)in ruling on the point of order, stated: The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Massachusetts extends beyond the scope of the language con- tained in section 406(a) at lines 13 and 14 of the committee amendment. The language therein contained is very narrow in its scope and applies to one specific phase of the operation. The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Massachusetts extends beyond loss on the sale of property, the matter contained in the amendment;therefore, the entire amendment of- fered by the gentleman from Massa- chusetts is not germane and the Chair sustains the point of order. ... Federal Funding of Rail- roadsÐAmendment Affecting Freight Rate Regulations §35.80 A proposal which may amend existing law in sev- eral respects but which is confined to the issue of fed- eral financial assistance does not necessarily permit, as germane, amendments to other sections of that law which involve federal regula- tions governing the entities being financed by the bill; thus, to a proposition amend- ing existing laws in several respects but limited in scope to the issue of federal fund- ing of railroads, an amend- ment to one of those laws to require any railroad to main- tain certain freight rate practices and waiving provi- sions of antitrust laws to per- mit enforcement of those rate practices was held not germane as addressing regu- latory authorities in law and not confined to the issue of federal financial assistance.

[F RED B.] R OONEY [of Pennsyl- vania]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment in the nature of a sub- stitute. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Mr. Rooney: Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the following: That this Act may be cited as the ``United States Railway Association Amendments Act of 1978''. Sec. 2. (a) Section 216(a) of the Re- gional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (45 U.S.C. 726(a)) is amended by striking out ``$1,100,000,000'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``$2,300,000,000''.

Section 216 of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (45 U.S.C. 726) is further amended by redesignating subsection (f) thereof as subsection (g) and by inserting immediately after subsection (e) thereof a new subsection as follows: ``(g)(1) The Association shall not invest the final $345,000,000 of the additional investment in the Cor- poration authorized by the RegionalRail Reorganization Act Amend- ments of 1978 unless and until (A) the Corporation has in effect an em- ployee stock ownership plan which satisfies the requirements of para- graphs (2) and (3), and (B) the re- quirements of the other paragraphs of this subsection have been satis- fied. ...

8921AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 George E. Brown, Jr. (Calif.).MS. [B ARBARA A.] M IKULSKI [of Maryland]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the bill on the grounds that the amendment is not germane because the amendment amends the Interstate Commerce Act and the Clayton Antitrust Act. Mr. Chairman, the amendment in the nature of a substitute is basically an authorization; it authorizes USRA to purchase ConRail securities. The amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Murphy) not only amends these two statutes, but also makes new policy concerning intraport equalization. The bill is not a policy oriented bill dealing with the Inter- state Commerce Act, but is rather es- sentially an authorization bill, by far, and I think it is not germane. ... MR. M URPHY [of New York:] Mr. Chairman, this amendment was adopt- ed by this House, passed into law, and incorporated in the 4R Act of 1976. What this amendment does is just restate the fact of the matter because the Interstate Commerce Commission and, of course, ConRail itself have failed to implement the law. Mr. Chairman, the amendment cer- tainly is germane. It has already been part of this act, and it is a restatement of the original amendment of 3 years ago. ... MR. R OBERT E. B AUMAN [of Mary- land]: Mr. Chairman, I point out that the substitute amendment to which the amendment is proposed amends the Regional Rail Reorganization Act. The amendment itself, however, amends the Interstate Commerce Act, an en- tirely different statute; and as has been pointed out by the gentlewoman from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], theClayton Act, which is not, I under- stand, under the jurisdiction of this committee, but under the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, which is a test of germaneness. Mr. Chairman, the entire thrust of the gentleman's amendment deals with the establishment and maintenance of rates, charges, and tariffs and their classifications and divisions, whereas the bill itself deals with nothing like that, but, rather, with the funding, de- bentures, and stocks and other related matters dealing with ConRail. ... THECHAIRMAN :(18)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. The gentlewoman from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] makes a point of order that the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Mur- phy) is not germane to the amendment in the nature of a substitute in that the Rooney amendment in the nature of a substitute amends the Regional Rail Transportation Act and provides for financial assistance to railroads in the ConRail system, while the amend- ment offered thereto amends the Inter- state Commerce Act and also provides changes in the Clayton Act which deal with the issue of antitrust matters and railroad rates applicable not only to ConRail but to other rail systems. The Chair, therefore, sustains the point of order.

REC. 3596, 94th Cong. 1st Sess. 20.Walter Flowers (Ala.).may be sufficiently com- prehensive to permit amend- ments which are germane to other sections of that law; thus, to a bill amending sev- eral sections of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, an amendment to a sec- tion of that Act not men- tioned in the bill, relating to congressional disapproval of reorganization plans, and germane to that section, was held germane to the bill (where the argument was not made that the amendment changed the rules of the House). During consideration of a bill to amend H.R. 2051 on Feb. 19, 1975,(19)the Chair overruled a point of order against the fol- lowing amendment: MR. [J OHN M.] A SHBROOK [of Ohio]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Ashbrook: On page 7 after line 24 in- sert a new section 5 (and number the succeeding Sections accordingly). Sec. 5. (a) Section 208(a) of the Re- gional Rail Reorganization Act of The sentence ``The final sys- tem plan shall be deemed approved at the end of the first period of 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after such date of trans- mittal unless either the House of Representatives or the Senate passesa resolution during such period stat- ing that it does not favor the final system.'' is amended by deleting the language after ``shall' and inserting in lieu thereof ``be voted by each House of Congress within the period of 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after such date of transmittal.''. .. MR. [J OHN D.] D INGELL [of Michi- gan]: Mr. Chairman, I make the point of order on two bases. ... The second point of order, Mr. Chair- man, is that the amendment goes be- yond the scope of the legislation before us. It deals with sections of the statute not currently before the House, and as such it seeks to go to matters on which Members of this body could not, in the exercise of reasonable prudence and care, have been forewarned as to the existence of the pendency of this par- ticular amendment, and that therefore the amendment is violative of the rule of germaneness and is not properly be- fore the body at this time. ... MR. ASHBROOK : ... [I]t is very clear that the entire matter is before us. We are talking about the bill as it now stands, referring to a prospective date of 60 days, when the plan would go into operation. All my amendment does is to change that, to make it affirma- tive action rather than negative action of the House that is required. I think it is consistent with the precedents and the point of order should be overruled. THECHAIRMAN :(20)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. ... As to the second point made by the gentleman from Michigan, the Chair has examined the amendment as well as the ``Ramseyer'' in the report on the VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01542 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

REC. 32169, 32170, 96th Cong. 2d Sess.bill under consideration and, in the opinion of the Chair, the bill under consideration amends several sections of the act, and is so comprehensive an amendment as to permit germane amendments to any portion of the law. The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Ohio is germane to the section 208 of the act which provides for review by Congress. Therefore the Chair overrules the point of order raised by the gentleman from Michi- gan. Parliamentarian's Note: Had the argument been made that the Ashbrook amendment constituted a change in House and Senate rules by requiring a vote in each House within a certain time pe- riod, the Chair would have been advised to sustain the germane- ness point of order. Urban Mass Transportation ActÐ``Buy American'' Provi- sions §35.82 To an amendment in the nature of a substitute comprehensively amending the Urban Mass Transpor- tation Act and authorizing the appropriation of funds to carry out that Act, an amend- ment further amending the Act to prohibit the obligation of funds authorized to be ap- propriated thereunder for certain contracts unless American-made goods beused, in pursuance of such contracts, to the extent spec- ified in the amendment, was held germane as a restriction on the broad authorities granted in the bill. During consideration of H.R. 6417(1)in the Committee of the Whole on Dec. 4, 1980,(2)it was held that, to a bill granting au- thorities to the federal govern- ment or authorizing the appro- priation of funds, an amendment denying the use of those authori- ties or funds to purchase foreign- made goods or equipment is ger- mane. The proceedings were as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Ober- star to the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Mr. How- ard, as amended: , after line 7, insert the following: BUY AMERICA Sec. 225. (a) Section 12 of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new sub- section: ``(h)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Transportation shall not obligate any funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act for any project contract whose total cost exceeds $500,000 unless only such unmanufactured ar- ticles, materials, and supplies as have been mined or produced in the VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01543 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

(b) The amendment made by sub- section (a) shall not apply to project contracts entered into on or before the date of enactment of this Act or options exercised pursuant to such contracts. Section 401 of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978 shall not apply to any project contract entered into after the date of enactment of this Act for a project to which section 12(h) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 ap- plies. ... MR. [B ILL] FRENZEL [of Minnesota]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ober- star). This proposed amendment vio- lates rule XVI, clause 7. ... Hinds' volume V, section 5825, states that while a committee may report a bill embracing different subjects, it is not in order during consideration in the House to introduce a new subject by way of amendment. Cannon's, chapter 8, section 2995, states that the burden of proof is on the proponent of an amendment to es- tablish germaneness, and where an amendment is equally susceptible to more than one interpretation, one of which renders it not germane, the Chair will rule it out of order. Mr. Chairman, the Oberstar amend- ment seeks to introduce a new subject which is part neither of this bill nor of the statute which this bill seeks to amend. The Oberstar amendmentwould introduce a Buy America re- quirement, through which funds will be limited, into the Urban Mass Tran- sit Act of 1964, where none now exists, and in so doing, it repeals the similar provision that currently exists in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978. It is an attempt to amend the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978 by adding to the statute which this bill amends and repealing it where it currently exists. It may be argued that the amend- ments made by this bill are sufficiently broad to open the entire 1964 act for amendment. But the 1964 act contains no such domestic content provision. The Oberstar amendment introduces a new subject, and couching it in lan- guage that tacks the provision on at the end of the existing section of the 1964 act is not enough to make it ger- mane. The Oberstar amendment really amends the Surface Transportation Act of 1978, an act which itself amend- ed the 1964 act. I submit that regardless of whether H.R. 6417 is broad enough to open the entire 1964 act for amendment, it is not broad enough to open other acts . . . for amendments as well, and neither is it broad enough to render germane any new subject. ... MR. [J AMES L.] O BERSTAR [of Min- nesota]: . .. I rise in opposition to the point of order. Mr. Chairman, the amendment that I am offering is to the Howard sub- stitute, which is substantially broad enough to admit an amendment deal- ing with the Buy America Act, which is a part of the original Urban Mass Transit Act. There was a Buy America VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01544 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

Studds (Mass.).provision in the Surface Transpor- tation Assistance Act of 1978, which provided that a final manufactured ar- ticle should be substantially all-Amer- ican produced and established the 10- percent price differential between for- eign and domestic bids. My amendment would broaden that language, which is existing law some- what, and is perfectly in order because it is an amendment to the Howard substitute and is restricted entirely to the language of the Urban Mass Transportation Act and does not, as the gentleman from Minnesota sug- gested, go beyond the provisions of the Urban Mass Transportation Act. ... THECHAIRMAN PROTEMPORE :(3)The Chair is prepared to rule. The Chair has heard the arguments of both the maker of the point of order and the opponent of it, and the Chair is constrained to agree with the gen- tleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) that the amendment amends only the Urban Mass Transportation Act. That law in 1978 was in effect amended by the Buy America title contained in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act, and the pending amendment only al- ters the effect of the 1978 law as it re- lates to authorities under UMTA. On two previous occasions, Buy America amendments have been held germane when offered to bills, comprehensively amending existing laws and drafted as restrictions on authorities contained in those laws. The first was on May 7, 1959, when Chairman Bass held germane to a bill permitting the Tennessee Valley Au- thority to raise capital by issuance of bonds, an amendment prohibiting useof such funds to purchase foreign-made equipment. On another occasion per- haps the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Frenzel) will recall, when he made a similar point of order to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act amendments; and the chairman of the committee at that time, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Natcher), on July 21, 1976, held the amendment to be in order. These precedents are contained in Deschler's Procedure, chapter 28, sections 4.27 and 23.7. The Chair, therefore, overrules the point of order and recognizes the gen- tleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) in support of his amendment for 5 minutes. Energy Research and Develop- ment ProgramsÐAmendment to Define ``Research and De- velopment'' §35.83 To a bill not only con- taining authorizations for one fiscal year but also amending permanent laws in several respects, an amend- ment further amending one of those laws in a related way may be germane; thus, to a bill, open to amendment at any point, which not only authorized civilian research and development programs for the Department of En- ergy for a fiscal year but also amended in diverse ways several permanent laws re- lating to energy research and VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01545 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

During consideration of H.R. 12163 in the Committee of the Whole on July 14(4)and July 17,(5)1978, the Chair overruled a point of order in the cir- cumstances described above.

Section 304 of the En- ergy Reorganization Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5874) is amended by inserting ``(a)'' after ``Sec. 304.'', and by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection: ``(b)(1) For purposes of this Act and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the Federal Non-nuclear Energy Re- search and Development Act of 1974, and the Department of Energy Orga- nization Act, the term ``research and development'' meansÐ ``(A) basic and applied research ... ``(D) concept and demonstration development; and ``(E) operational systems develop- ment. ``(2) As used in paragraph (1)Ð ``(A) the term ``basic research'' means systematic and intensive study directed toward greater knowl- edge or understanding of a specific subject, and toward the expansion of man's fundamental knowledge of na- ture (with or without immediate rel- evance to specific technology pro- grams). ...

8927AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 Barbara Jordan (Tex.).the House, it is well settled that the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 re- ferred to is a statute relating to the re- organization of government and does not lie under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science and Technology. I would point out that the amend- ment clearly seeks to amend a statute lying under the jurisdiction of another committee. ... I would point out that the amend- ment here offered by the gentleman from Florida seeks to change perma- nent law, as opposed to simply laying forth for the House the basis upon which appropriations may be made, which is the basic purpose on which this particular legislation is before the House. The amendment affects the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. I point out again that this amend- ment, which is offered to a 1-year au- thorization, is permanent legislation, defining a rather sweeping responsi- bility of the Department of Energy of which I am not able to advise the Chair of all the consequences, nor is the author. In reiteration, I point out that this is an authorization bill, and it includes limitations and procedural changes. Of course, adoption of this amendment does not affect jurisdiction of any com- mittee or affect the rules of the House. Other permanent provisions of the amendment go much beyond the provi- sions of an annual authorization, and deal with what is essentially perma- nent and lasting legislation, not only of the Atomic Energy Act, but also again, I reiterate, another statute not under the jurisdiction of this committee at all, the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which was referred to the Com-mittee on Government Operations. ... MR. [J OHN W.] W YDLER [of New York]: Madam Chairman, I would only point out to the Chair that in the bill the gentleman from Michigan is going to bring to the floor immediately upon the conclusion of the bill we are now considering, he amends the Depart- ment of Energy Act in many places, and I would be hard pressed to under- stand how he is going to defend that action when he is contending that doing this is a violation of the rules of the House. ... THE CHAIRMAN :(6)The Chair is ready to rule. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) raises a point of order against the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Florida (Mr. Fuqua) on the basis that the amendment is not germane to the legislation. The Chair would state to the gentleman from Michigan that this amendment does not amend the rules of the House. Under the rule which provides for con- sideration of this legislation a sub- stitute was made in order as an origi- nal bill, the substitute which was an amendment by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Fuqua) printed in the Record on the 23d of June. In the substitute which was made in order as an original bill, the energy Reorganization Act is substantively amended in a permanent way. The gentleman from Florida now seeks to add a new title following the ``general provisions'' portion of the bill to pro- vide a definition of research and devel- opment under the aegis of the Energy Reorganization Act.

The amendment obviously relates to the question of energy research and de- velopment, the subject of the pending bill. Consequently the Chair overrules the point of order raised by the gen- tleman from Michigan. Rationing Under Emergency Petroleum Allocation ActÐ User Charges for Allocations §35.84 To a section of an amendment in the nature of a substitute which amended section 4 of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 to authorize the Presi- dent to establish priorities, including rationing of gaso- line, among users of petro- leum products, an amend- ment providing that any ra- tioning proposal for indi- vidual users of gasoline should include payment of a user charge to qualify for ad- ditional allocations was held to constitute a tax which was not within the category of ra- tioning authority in the sub- stitute and was ruled out as not germane. During consideration of the En- ergy Emergency Act (H.R. 11450) in the Committee of the Whole onDec. 14, 1973,(7)the Chair ruled that an amendment to an amend- ment in the nature of a substitute was not germane. The proceedings were as follows: Sec. 103. Amendments to the Emer- gency Petroleum Allocation Act of (a) Section 4 of the Emergency Petro- leum Allocation Act of 1973 is amend- ed by adding at the end thereof the fol- lowing new subsections: ``(h)(1) If the President finds that, without such action, the objectives of subsection (b) cannot be attained, he may promulgate a rule which shall be deemed a part of the regulation under subsection (a) and which shall provide, consistent with the objectives of sub- section (b), an ordering of priorities among users of crude oil, residual fuel oil, or any refined petroleum product, and for the assignment to such users of rights entitling them to obtain any such oil or product in precedence to other users not similarly entitled. A top priority in such ordering shall be the maintenance of vital services (in- cluding, but not limited to new housing construction, education, health care, hospitals, public safety, energy produc- tion, agriculture, and transportation services, which are necessary to the preservation of health, safety, and the public welfare). ... ``(6) For purposes of this subsection, the term `allocation' shall not be con- strued to exclude the end-use alloca- tion of gasoline to individual con- sumers.

REC. 41688, 41689, 93d Cong. 1st Sess.amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Staggers). The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Martin of North Carolina to the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Mr. Staggers: On page 6, at line 6, strike the period, and add: ``; Pro- vided, however, That any proposal by the President for the rationing of fuel for personal automobiles and recreational vehicles should, in addi- tion to the basic non-discriminatory ration, include provisions under which the individual consumer may qualify for additional allocations of fuel upon payment of a free or user charge on a per unit basis to the Federal Energy Administration.'' MR. [H ARLEY O.] S TAGGERS [of West Virginia]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment on the ground that it is not germane. ... I make the point of order on the amendment on the ground that it au- thorizes a user's fee in the nature of a tax and that is not supposed to come within the jurisdiction of our com- mittee. That authority is delegated to the Ways and Means Committee. MR. MARTIN of [North Carolina:] Mr. Chairman, I believe that the amend- ment is germane and pertinent to the section dealing with gasoline rationing. ... This amendment does not propose a tax as such and so does not run afoul of the prerogatives of the honorable Committee on Ways and Means. In- stead it proposes an administrative fee to be charged, much as fees are charged by the National Park Service under the Golden Eagle plan for use ofour park resources. This fee as I pro- pose it would be charged for pref- erential use of any extra limited fuel resources. THECHAIRMAN :(8)The Chair is con- strained to sustain the point of order on the ground that this amendment in effect would result in a tax not directly related to the rationing authority con- ferred by the amendment in the nature of a substitute.

8930DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 Chair overruled a point of order against the following amendment: MR. [L OUIS C.] W YMAN [of New Hampshire]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Staggers). The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Wyman to the amendment in the na- ture of a substitute offered by Mr. Staggers: On page 59, after line 23, insert the following: (1) Section 202(b) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 1857) is amended by adding at the end thereof the fol- lowing: ``(6)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the authority of the Administrator to require emissions controls on automobiles is hereby suspended except for automobiles registered to residents of those areas of the United States as specified by subsection (b) of this section, until January 1, 1977, or the day on which the President declares that shortage of petroleum is at an end, whichever occurs later. (b) Within 60 days after the date of enactment of this paragraph, and annually thereafter, the Adminis- trator shall designate, subject to the limitations set forth herein, geo- graphic areas of the United States in which there is significant auto emis- sions related air pollution. The Ad- ministrator shall not designate as such area any part of the United States outside the following Air Quality Control Regions as defined by the Administrator as of the date of enactment of this paragraph with- out justification to and prior ap- proval of the Congress. ... (3) Section 203(a)(3) of such Act is amended to read as follows: ``(3) for any person to register, on or after 60 days after the date of en-actment of this paragraph, a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine for which the regulations prescribed under section 202(a)(1) do not apply under section 202(a)(3) if such per- son resides in a geographic area des- ignated by the Administrator to be a geographic area in which there is significant air pollution; or''. ... MR. [J OHN D.] D INGELL [of Michi- gan]: . .. The second ground on which I make a point of order is that at no point in the bill before us appears an amendment to section 203 of the Clean Air Act. In fact, the gentleman's amendment deals with section 203 and not with the sections which are before us. As the Chair will observe from the reading of the Clean Air Act, section 203 is the penalty section and relates to certifications. Section 202(b) man- dates the EPA to establish emission limitations for automobiles, and it is to section 202(b) which the bill itself now does apply. The amendment goes much further than that and it restricts the authority of automobile owners to reg- ister automobiles in States, and this matter is not spoken to otherwise or elsewhere in the legislation before us. It is, therefore, my strong view, Mr. Chairman, that the amendment before us is not germane to the legislation in dealing with subjects not in the bill and not presently before the House. Obviously the germaneness rules are here to protect Members from being surprised by amendments which relate to matters different than those before us. Obviously the amendment relates to sections of the Clean Air Act and to matters that are not before us. For that reason the point of order against the amendment should be sustained. ...

W YMAN : ... [The amendment] simply suspends . .. the authority of the Administrator to impose [require- ments for emission controls] for a defi- nite period during the energy crisis. This is so plainly in order that I sub- mit the Chair should overrule the point of order. THE CHAIRMAN :(11)The Chair is ready to rule. ... The second aspect of the point of order is the question of nongermane- ness in connection with the Clean Air Act. The Chair has simply looked at the Ramseyer on the bill before us and it is very clear that the Clean Air Act is comprehensively amended by the bill and by the pending amendment in the nature of a substitute. Therefore, the Chair overrules the point of order of the gentleman from Michigan. Regulations Affecting Ration- ing of Petroleum ProductsÐ Amending Rules To Establish Congressional Disapproval Procedure §35.86 While an amendment amending the rules of the House to establish a special disapproval procedure would not ordinarily be germane to a proposition which granted certain authority to the exec- utive but did not contain a provision affecting congres- sional procedure, such an amendment is in order where the section of lawbeing amended by that prop- osition contains a com- parable provision. On Dec. 14, 1973,(12)the Com- mittee of the Whole had under consideration a section of an amendment in the nature of a substitute which amended section 4 of the Emergency Petroleum Al- location Act of 1973 to authorize the president to establish prior- ities, including rationing proce- dures, among users of petroleum products. An amendment was of- fered which conditioned the effec- tiveness of those regulations upon subsequent congressional dis- approval (amending the rules of both Houses to provide for the privileged consideration of dis- approval resolutions). The amend- ment was held germane, where the section of law being amended already contained a provision per- mitting either House to dis- approve regulations exempting certain petroleum products from allocations under that section. The proceedings were as fol- lows: MR. [H.

The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Heinz to the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Mr. Staggers. , after line 18, insert the fol- lowing new subsection: (e) Section 4 of the Emergency Petroleum Alloca- tion Act of 1973 is amended by in- serting at the end thereof the fol- lowing new subsections: ``(l)(1) The President shall transmit any rule (other than any technical or clerical amendments) which amends the regulation (promulgated pursu- ant to subsection (a) of this section) with respect to end-use allocation authorized under subsection (h) of this section. ``(2) Any such rule with respect to end-use allocation shall, for purposes of subsections (m) and (n) of this sec- tion, be treated as an energy action and shall take effect only if such ac- tions are not disapproved by either House of Congress as provided in subsections (m) and (n) of this sec- tion. ``(m) D ISAPPROVAL OF CONGRESS . ... ``(3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, an energy action shall take effect at the end of the first period of 15 cal- endar days of continuous session of Congress after the date on which the plan is transmitted to it unless, be- tween the date of transmittal and the end of the 15-day period, either House passes a resolution stating in substance that that House not favor the energy action. . .. ``(n) D ISAPPROVAL PROCEDURE .Ð ``(1) This subsection is enacted by CongressÐ ``(A) as an exercise of the rule- making power of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respec- tively, and as such they are deemed a part of the rules of each House, re- spectively, but applicable only withrespect to the procedure to be fol- lowed in that House in the case of resolutions described by paragraph (2) of this subsection; and they su- persede other rules only to the ex- tent that they are inconsistent there- with; and ``(B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relat- ing to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that House. ... ``(4)(A) If the committee to which a resolution with respect to an energy action has been referred has not re- ported it at the end of 5 calendar days after its introduction, it is in order to move either to discharge the committee from further consider- ation of the resolution or to dis- charge the committee from further consideration of any other resolution with respect to the energy action which has been referred to the com- mittee. ``(B) A motion to discharge may be made only by an individual favoring the resolution, is highly privileged (except that it may not be made after the committee has reported a resolution with respect to the same energy action), and debate thereon shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to. ... MR.

8933AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 chinery with respect to the allocation section of the bill which is covered in section 103 of that bill so as to provide that the powers which are to be exer- cised in allocation, including end use allocation, shall be subject to presen- tation to the Congress during a 15-day period in which, if they are not vetoed by one or the other House, such provi- sions may be canceled by having been denied by the two Houses. There is nothing in the original bill or in the amendment that provides for any procedure by which the matter shall be resubmitted to the Congress. There is nothing in the amendment in the nature of a substitute that has any such procedure in it. The amendment offered here pro- vides an extensive amendment of the procedures of both the House and Sen- ate with respect to the manner in which this is accomplished. I should like to point out to the Chair that this is not a small change in policy or in law but an extremely large one. What it purports to do, in ef- fect, is to change the role of the Presi- dency and that of the Congress and to afford a special procedure by which this bill reserves to the Congress the administrative position, a position in which as a condition subsequent to the passage of this bill this bill may re- quire a second look at the entire ques- tion and a determination on the ques- tion of policy by the Congress. The major thrust of my point of order does not go to any question of constitutionality. It indicates too the fact that the mat- ter contained herein so sweepingly al- ters the procedures of the House, and the work to accommodate itself to thispeculiar and unusual problem, that it is far beyond the scope of any provision in the bill. It does not in a minor man- ner change the bill, but it changes it in an extremely substantial manner be- cause it calls upon the House to make a deep and complete policy determina- tion with respect to the question of al- location at a time subsequent to the passage of the bill, and give that policy determination the effect of law as a condition subsequent to its particular enactment. ... MR. HEINZ: ... Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Texas contends on the one hand that my amendment is not constitutional, and on the other that it is not germane to the bill. On the first point I would like to in- dicate, Mr. Chairman, that there are already on the statute books two laws, the War Powers Act, and the Proce- dure for Approving Executive Reorga- nizations. They use the same proce- dure for the two items I mentioned. Therefore I do not feel that the point of constitutionality can stand the test. Second, the gentleman from Texas argues that my amendment and the disapproval portion thereof is not ger- mane to the bill. Were this the case it would seem to me inconsistent, Mr. Chairman, because we would not have had, as we did 2 days ago, a vote on the Broyhill amendment which in- cluded the exact same procedures as exist in my amendment. Admittedly, section 105 is not sec- tion 103 but, nonetheless, both amend- ments were offered to the amendment in the nature of a substitute, H.R. I do not believe, therefore, Mr. Chairman, that the point of order has merit.

E CKHARDT : Mr. Chairman, I should like to urge one other point aside from the germaneness question, and that is that the amendment is out of order because it seeks to amend the Rules of the House. MR. HEINZ: Mr. Chairman, if I may be heard further, I just do not think that the gentleman from Texas is cor- rect. What is in this amendment is simply no different from writing into the bill, which we could do at any time, for any section, a provision which might say ``notwithstanding anything in Section 103 or any other section, the Executive Branch has to come back to the Congress for enactment or ap- proval or determination, or anything.'' THECHAIRMAN :(13)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Eckhardt) makes a very interesting and strong argument. The Chair in its ruling is persuaded that the question is a narrow question. The Chair does not rule on the constitutional questions raised in this argument; but there are two aspects of the matter that the Chair takes into consideration in its decision. One, which the Chair believes to be the lesser one, is the fact that in the original bill there is a similar pro- vision which in turn was offered as an amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute. But the Chair relies primarily on the fact that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Heinz) is in fact an amendment to section 4 of Pub- lic Law 93±159, the Emergency Petro- leum Allocation Act which, in a dif- ferent manner, does provide for a pro- cedure whereby the President shallmake submissions to the Congress. And whereby either House may dis- approve of such submissions. Therefore the Chair overrules the point of order. Indirectly Superseding Other Law §35.87 To a section of a bill amending the Defense Pro- duction Act providing finan- cial assistance for synthetic fuel development to meet na- tional defense needs, an amendment providing expe- dited review and approval of certain designated priority projects to be financed by the bill, thereby indirectly affecting time periods for procedural review specified in other laws, but not specifi- cally waiving provisions of substantive law which might prohibit completion of such projects, was held germane as not directly amending substantive environmental or energy laws within the juris- diction of other committees.

8935AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 Massachusetts, overruled a point of order and held the following amendment to be germane: Amendment offered by Mr. Udall: , after line 13 add the following new subsection and renumber the sub- sequent sections accordingly: (g)(1) The Secretary of Energy is hereby authorized to designate a pro- posed synthetic fuel or feedstock facil- ity as a priority synthetic project pur- suant to the procedures and criteria provided in this section. ... (h)(1) Any person planning or pro- posing a synthetic fuel or feedstock fa- cility may apply to the Secretary of En- ergy for an order designating such fa- cility as a priority synthetic project. ... (i) Not later than forty-five days after receipt of an application author- ized under the previous section, the Secretary shall determine whether the proposed synthetic fuel or feedstock fa- cility is of sufficient national interest to be designated a priority synthetic project. Upon reaching a determination the Secretary shall publish his decision in the Federal Register and shall no- tify the applicant and the agencies identified in subsection (h)(3). In mak- ing such a determination the Secretary shall considerÐ (1) the extent to which the facility would reduce the Nation's dependence upon imported oil; (2) the magnitude of any adverse en- vironmental impacts associated with the facility and the existence of alter- natives that would have fewer adverse impacts; ... (7) the extent to which the applicant is prepared to complete or has alreadycompleted the significant actions which the applicant in consultation with the Deputy Secretary anticipate will be identified under subsection (1) as re- quired from the applicant; and (8) the public comments received concerning such facility. ... (l) Not later than thirty days after notice appears in the Federal Register of an order designating a proposed syn- thetic fuel or feedstock facility as a pri- ority synthetic project, any Federal agency with authority to grant or deny any approval or to perform any action necessary to the completion of such project or any part thereof, shall trans- mit to the Secretary of Energy and to the priority energy projectÐ (1) a compilation of all significant ac- tions required by such agency before a final decision or any necessary ap- proval(s) can be rendered; (2) a compilation of all significant ac- tions and information required of the applicant before a final decision by such agency can be made; (3) a tentative schedule for com- pleting actions and obtaining the infor- mation listed in subsections (1) and (2) of this subsection; (4) all necessary application forms that must be completed by the priority energy project before such approval can be granted; and (5) the amounts of funds and per- sonnel available to such agency to con- duct such actions and the impact of such schedule on other applications pending before such agency.

(4) Except as provided in subpara- graph (3) above and in subsection (p) no deadline established under this sec- tion or extension granted under sub- paragraph (5) of the section may result in the total time for agency action ex- ceeding nine months beginning from the date on which notice appears in the Federal Register of an order desig- nating the proposed synthetic fuel or feedstock facility as a priority synthetic project. (5) Notwithstanding any deadline or other provision of Federal law, the deadlines imposed by the Project Deci- sion Schedule shall constitute the law- ful decisionmaking deadlines for re- viewing applications filed by the pri- ority synthetic project. ... MR. [J OHN D.] D INGELL [of Michi- gan]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order that the amendment offered by my good friend from Arizona is not germane. ... Mr. Chairman, it is well settled the amendment must be germane not only to the section but also to the bill. Mr. Chairman, the bill relates to the Defense Production Act. Mr. Chairman, under the amend- ment, a lengthy process is established whereunder the Secretary of Energy, who is not mentioned elsewhere in the bill, is authorized to designate syn-thetic fuel or feedstocks facilities as priority synthetic projects, pursuant to lengthy criteria which are set forth at the first and second pages and fol- lowing. So, Mr. Chairman, there is a whole range of broad new responsibilities im- posed on the Secretary of Energy not found elsewhere, either in the Defense Production Act or in the bill before us, which are quite complex, very obvious, and which involve a lengthy amount of work and which involve amendment ei- ther directly or indirectly of a large number of Federal, State, and local statutes dealing with the project and permitting the project. There is also an extensive procedural responsibility on both the Secretary and one which is imposed on the Gov- ernor of the State in which the action would occur. For that reason, Mr. Chairman, a Member of this body could not very well anticipate as would be required by the rules of germaneness that an amendment of this sweep and breadth could be visited upon us. ... MR. [R OBERT E.] B AUMAN [of Mary- land]: Mr. Chairman, a further point of order. ... I make a point of order against the amendment for the following reasons: The bill before us, H.R. 3930, amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 and it does so by extending the author- ity of the act and also providing for the purchase of synthetic fuels and syn- thetic chemical feed stock and for other purposes. An examination of the other purposes reveals nothing akin to the amendment before us.

8937AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 of 1969, specifically on page 5 in sub- paragraph (d) to the facilities that would contract with the Government. It appears to me that by attempting to do this, this is beyond the scope of the jurisdiction of this committee. It is within the scope of other committees' jurisdictions and certainly beyond the scope of the bill, which simply deals with contracts and purchases and not the environmental qualities or activi- ties of the people who seek to contract with the Government. Therefore, the amendment is not germane and beyond the scope of the bill. ... MR. [M ORRIS K.] U DALL [of Arizona]: ... The pending bill creates authority to finance directly and indirectly syn- thetic fuel and chemical feed stocks, feedstock projects. ... What my amendment does is not to change any of the existing laws. It does not change any environmental protec- tion laws or anything else, but it says we are going to have decisions. Within nine months after this is put on the fast track, we are going to get a yes or no decision on it. ... This amendment simply supple- ments the existing statutory proce- dures to achieve expedited approval or disapproval of various authorities nec- essary for the completion of synfuel projects created under the authority of the legislation; so the subject matter of the amendment is germane to the sub- ject of the pending legislation. The point of order ought to be rejected, Mr. Chairman. THECHAIRMAN : The Chair is pre- pared to rule. The bill before the committee bestows authority for loan guaranteesto finance synthetic fuel or feedstock facility construction. The amendment of the gentleman from Arizona estab- lishes a complex mechanism for expe- diting procedures for projects financed by loan guarantees under the bill. The Chair is unable in response to the gentleman from Maryland to find any respect in which the amendment of the gentleman from Arizona would amend the National Environmental Protection Act, but merely provides that determinations made as to pri- ority of synthetic projects eligible for expeditious review shall not be consid- ered major Federal actions under that law. In the opinion of the Chair, the total- ity of the Udall amendment constitutes essentially an expediting of procedures under authorities provided for in the bill and is, therefore, germane. The Chair overrules the point of order.

On Oct. 14, 1978,(16)during con- sideration of H.R. 14014 in the Committee of the Whole, the Chair overruled a point of order against the following amendment: Amendment offered by Mr. Ron- calio: On page 32, after line 21, add new section (No. 12) as follows: ``The Department of the Army Per- mit to Basin Electric Power Coopera- tive for the Missouri Basin Power Project, issued on March 23, 1978, as amended October 10, 1978, is hereby deemed to satisfy the requirements of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). ... MR. [J OHN J.] C AVANAUGH [of Ne- braska]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment. The amendment is not germane to the sec- tion of the bill to which it is offered, and in addition it imposes duties upon the Secretary of Commerce that are nowhere else mentioned in the bill. MR. [M ARK] ANDREWS of North Da- kota: ... If a project of this type is stopped because of an interpretation of an act of the Congress, how then can the rules of the Congress prohibit the same Congress from amending the ac- tion so that it does not affect a certain type of project? This is basically what the argument is all about. And to tie up projects which would prevent the homeowners from getting their elec- tricity at a sensible cost because of the interpretation of the lawÐif it cannot be fixed in this body where can it be fixed? ...MR. [F RANK E.] E VANS of Colo- rado: ... I think the amendment now pending offered by the gentleman from Wyoming is clearly in order. The sim- ple thing this amendment does is de- clare a legislative funding of fact rel- ative to the Endangered Species Act. Thus it is clearly germane. THE CHAIRMAN :(17)The Chair is ready to rule. This occupant of the Chair had, as indicated, to make a rather rapid analysis of the previous amendment, not having been aware of the questions at issue. The present amendment offered by the gentleman from Wyoming would appear, based on the information that the Chair has available and on the precedents avail- able to him including the precedent cited by the gentleman from Wyoming, to be germane and completely in the proper form, and therefore overrules the point of order in connection with the amendment of the gentleman from Wyoming.

On Oct. 8, 1974,(18)the Com- mittee of the Whole had under consideration House Resolution 988, to reform the structure, juris- diction and procedures of House committees. Pending was an amendment in the nature of a substitute amending Rules X and XI and making conforming changes in other rules to reform the structure, jurisdiction and procedures of committees, and containing miscellaneous provi- sions reorganizing certain institu- tional facilities of the House. The amendment had been perfected by amendment to eliminate a revi- sion of Rule XVI which had pro- posed changes in Committee of the Whole procedure. Pursuant to a point of order, the amendment in the nature of a substitute was held not to be sufficiently broad in scope to admit as germane an amendment to Rule VIII to permit pairs on recorded votes in Com- mittee of the Whole.

8940DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 William H. Natcher (Ky.).The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Bing- ham to the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Mrs. Han- sen of Washington: On page 53, after line 2, insert the following: ``PAIRS IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE ``Sec. 209. The first sentence of clause 2 of rule VIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives is amended by inserting `by the House or Committee of the Whole' imme- diately before the first comma.''. .. MR. [N EAL] S MITH of Iowa: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment for the reason that it is an amendment to rule VIII, whereas the principal resolution under consideration here, House Resolution 988, attempts to amend rules X and XI only. Therefore, the amendment is not germane. ... MR. B INGHAM : . .. This would amend title II of the resolution, which is headed, ``Miscellaneous and Con- forming Provisions.'' That title of the resolution is not limited to changes in rules X and XI. It affects other rules, section 207, for example, amendment to rule XVI, and under the heading of ``Miscellaneous and Conforming Provi- sions,'' it would seem to me that a sim- ple amendment to rule VIII would clearly be in order. THE CHAIRMAN :(19)The Chair is ready to rule. On hearing the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Bingham), the Chair is of the opinion that there is nothing in the Hansen amendment in the nature of a substitute, as perfected, relating tovoting procedures in the Committee of the Whole. The miscellaneous provi- sions in the Hansen amendment, as perfected by the Waggonner amend- ment, do not broaden the Hansen amendment to the extent suggested by the gentleman from New York. Therefore, the point of order must be sustained, and the point of order is sustained.

On Mar. 7, 1973,(20)during con- sideration of a resolution amend- ing several clauses of a rule of the House but confined in its scope to the issue of access to committee meetings and hearings, an amend- ment to another clause of that rule relating to committee staffing was held to be not germane. The proceedings were as follows: MR. [J OHN B.] A NDERSON of Illinois: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Ander- son of Illinois: On page 2, line 24, add a new section 4, to read as fol- lows: Clause 32(c) of rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives is amended to read as follows: ``(c) The minority party on any such standing committee is entitled, upon request of a majority of such minority, to up to one-third of the funds provided for the appointment of committee staff pursuant to each primary or additional expense reso- lution. The committee shall appoint any persons so selected whose char- acter and qualifications are accept- able to a majority of the committee. If the committee determines that the character and qualifications of any person so selected are unacceptable to the committee, a majority of the minority party members may select other persons for appointment by thecommittee to the staff until such ap- pointment is made. Each staff mem- ber appointed under this subpara- graph shall be assigned to such com- mittee business as the minority party members of the committee con- sider advisable.''. . . MR. [J OHN J.] M CFALL [of Cali- fornia]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment on the ground that it is not germane to the matter that we are considering. The matter that we are considering has to do with access to committee meetings, and the amendment has to do with staff make-ups, and they are entirely two different subject matters. . . . MR. ANDERSON of Illinois: Mr. Chair- man, House Resolution 259, the resolu- tion we are considering today amends two clauses in rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives. I am proposing another amendment to rule XI namely the provision dealing with minority staffing of committees. I contend this amendment is ger- mane and in order. Having only Can- non's Procedure of the 87th Congress available to me, I quote from page 201 of that volume dealing with germane- ness: But where the bill proposes to amend existing law in several par- ticulars, no arbitrary rule can be laid down either admitting or excluding further amendments to the law not proposed in the pending bill, but the question of the germaneness of such additional amendments must be de- termined in each instance on the merits of the case presented (VIII, 2938). This ruling was made by Chairman Sydney Anderson of Minnesota on June 10, 1921.

8942DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 Joe D. Waggoner, Jr. (La.).The Chair does not think that the general rule can be laid down that where several portions of a law are amended by a bill reported by a com- mittee, it is not in any case in order to amend another section of the bill not included in the bill reported by the committee, nor does the Chair think that the opposite rule can be laid down and rigidly applied in every instance. The Chair thinks that a question of this kind must be determined in every instance in the light of the facts which are presented in the case. In the particular case under consideration it appears that the committee has reported a bill which amends several sections of Title IV of the bill in various particu- lars. The Chair does not feel that he can hold that no amendment to a section not dealt with by the com- mittee is not in order. Mr. Chairman, I feel my amendment would clearly be in order. Mr. Chairman, the substitute rule would not make it possible for any other amendments to be made to rule XI. It seems to me this further argues in favor of the germaneness of this par- ticular amendment. I ask that the point of order be overruled. THECHAIRMAN :(1)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. House Resolution 259, while it tech- nically amends two different clauses of rule XI, relates solely to the single sub- ject of public access to House com- mittee meetings and hearings. Thus, amendments to other portions of rule XI pertaining to committee jurisdiction such as staffing, and procedures other than access to hearings and meetings would not be germane. Under the precedents, the fact that a bill amends several sections of a lawdoes not necessarily open the whole law to amendment. The purpose and scope of the bill must be considered. In the 89th Congress, the Committee of the Whole had under consideration a bill amending the National Labor Rela- tions Act to repeal section 14(b) of that law. On that occasion, in several rul- ings by Chairman O'Brien of New York, the principal was reiterated that where a bill is amendatory of existing law in several particulars, but relates to a single subject affected thereby, amendments proposing to modify the law but not related to the bill are not germane (July 28, 1965, Rec. p. 18631± 18645). For this reason, the Chair holds that the amendment is not germane and sustains the point of order.

During consideration of H.R. 12835(2)in the Committee of the Whole on May 11, 1976,(3)the Chair sustained a point of order against an amendment, as de- scribed above. The Clerk read as follows: TITLE IIIÐTECHNICAL AID AND MISCELLANEOUS EDUCATION AMENDMENTS; REPEALERS, EXTENSIONS, AND EFFECTIVE DATES TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS Sec. 301. (a) The Education Amendments of 1974 is amended . . . (n) Section 403(17) of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, Eighty-first Congress), is amended by striking out ``(but not including'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``; but at the option of a local educational agency, such term need not include''; and such section is further amended by striking out ``residing in non- project areas)'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``residing in noproject areas''. . . . (e)(1) Section 5(c)(1) of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, Eighty-first Congress), as amended by the Education Amendments of 1974, is amended to read as follows: ``(1) He shall first allocate to each local educational agency which is en-titled to a payment under section 2 an amount equal to 100 per centum of the amount to which it is entitled as computed under that section for such fiscal year and he shall further allocate to each local educational agency which is entitled to a pay- ment under section 3 an amount equal to 25 per centum of the amount to which it is entitled as computed under section 3(d) for such fiscal year.''. (2) Section 5(c)(2) of such Act, as so amended, is amended (A) by strik- ing out ``; and'' at the end of clause (F) and substituting a period, and (B) by striking out clause (G). . . . MR. [W ILLIAM D.] F ORD of Michigan: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Ford of Michigan: , immediately after line 3, insert the following: (g) The fourth sentence of section 403(1) (20 U.S.C. 244(1)) of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress), is amended by inserting immediately before the pe- riod at the end thereof the following: ``, except that such term shall in- clude all real property owned by the United States Postal Service which is not subject to any State or local real property tax'' used for the sup- port of education. ... MR. [A LBERT H.] Q UIE [of Min- nesota]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment of- fered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ford) on the grounds that it is not germane to the bill under consider- ation. The gentleman's amendment seeks to amend the definitions title of impact aid, Public Law 874 of the 81st Con- gress. The bill before us contains only two technical amendments to impact aid.

8944DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 B. F. Sisk (Calif.).gentleman from Michigan seeks to make a major change in the impact aid law by substantially increasing pay- ments under the program. The gen- tleman seeks to include his amend- ment in title III, which relates to tech- nical and miscellaneous amendments. Clearly, the amendment offered by the gentleman is not technical and is sub- stantial in nature. It is my view that the amendment is in violation of clause 7 of rule XVI of the Rules of the House of Representa- tives. I cite as precedent for my posi- tion the ruling of the Chair on Novem- ber 29, 1971, when the Chair ruled that an amendment to regulate a broad scope of activities is not germane to a proposition imposing restrictions within a limited area of activities. I would also cite as a precedent the ruling of the Chair on April 28, 1971, to the effect that an amendment pro- posing changes in another section of a law is not germane to a bill amending one section of existing law to accom- plish a particular purpose. ... The amendment is also in violation of clause 5 of rule XXI, relating to ap- propriations since the amendment is effective immediately and thereby af- fects already appropriated funds. ... THECHAIRMAN :(4)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. In connection with the point of order the gentleman from Minnesota makes regarding the question of germaneness, the Chair has examined the amend- ment and the legislation to which the amendment is offered. Upon an exam- ination of title III, which is a very di- verse title and is open to amendment at any point, that title actually amendsPublic Law 81±874 in two diverse re- spects, as indicated on pages 214 to 217 of the Ramseyer rule in the com- mittee report, section 403 of that act is amended in the bill on page 186. This amendment would make a further change in that section of the law. Therefore, on the basis of germane- ness, it is the opinion of the Chair that the amendment is germane; however, with respect to the point of order that the amendment violates clause 5, rule XXI, it appears to the Chair, recalling the debate on the rule of yesterday where points of order were waived against the committee amendment, that there are in existence appro- priated funds for impact aid purposes which this amendment would permit to be used for a new category of recipi- ents. Since the amendment permits a new use of funds already appropriated, the Chair would have to hold that that amendment is a violation of clause 5, rule XXI and, therefore, would sustain that portion of the point of order. Now, the Chair would state, of course, that we are dealing here with a point of order dealing exclusively with the reuse of funds already appro- priated. Therefore, the Chair sustains the point of order in connection with clause 5 of rule XXI. Parliamentarian's Note: While the bill was primarily a vocational Education Act amendment and ex- tension, title III amended mis- cellaneous education laws, includ- ing diverse laws on elementary and secondary education, and thus greatly broadened the scope of the bill.

On Sept. 29, 1975,(5)it was demonstrated that the test of the germaneness of an amendment is its relationship to the pending portion of a bill to which offered, and where a bill is by unanimous consent considered as read and open to amendment at any point, the germaneness of an amend- ment thereto is determined by its relationship to the entire bill rath-er than to the particular section to which offered.

(a)(1) Section 2401(a) of title 39, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: ``(a)(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Postal Service for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, such sums as may be nec- essary to enable the Postal Service to carry out the purposes, functions, and powers authorized by this title. ...

MR. HANLEY : Mr. Chairman, I raise [a] point of order on the grounds that the matter contained in the amend- ment is in violation of clause 7, rule XVI of the rules of the House, which provides in part thatÐ No motion or proposition on a sub- ject different from that under consid- eration shall be admitted under color of amendment. The bill under consideration, H.R. 8603, is narrow in scope since it re- lates only to the following specific sub- ject matters.First, it provides authorization for increased public service appropriations by changing the statutory formula cur- rently in existence. Second, it would limit the amount of the next temporary rate increase and would establish new procedures and limitations for the implementation of other future temporary postal rates. Third, it would amend the law with respect to the Postal Rate Commission by changing its procedures to expedite rate and classification cases; by sub- jecting the Commissioners to Senate confirmation; and by expanding the powers of the Chairman in admin- istering the Commission. ... THECHAIRMAN : The Chair is pre- pared to rule. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Hanley) has made a point of order to the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Arkansas (Mr. Alexander) to section 2 of the bill. The gentleman's point of order relates, in the Chair's judgment, primarily to the germane- ness based upon the scope of the gen- tleman's amendment and as it relates to the scope of the bill, which bill is open to amendment at any point. The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Arkansas (Mr. Alexander) actually amends section 2(a) of the bill, although section 2(a) of the Postal Act is not amended in the bill before the Committee here this afternoon. The Chair notes, however, as con- ceded by the chairman of the sub- committee, there are several enumer- ated purposes which touch upon many different ramifications and aspects of the postal law. These purposes are di- verse in nature.

McKinnon (Calif.).luctantly comes to the conclusion that the position of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hanley) in his point of order is not well founded and, there- fore, the Chair must overrule the point of order made by the gentleman from New York. Bill Affecting Salaries and Number of Grades in Postal Field ServiceÐAmendment Relating to Annual and Sick Leave §35.94 To a bill relating to the number of grades and posi- tions in the postal field serv- ice and providing salary in- creases for personnel in such service, an amendment relat- ing to annual and sick leave of such personnel was held to be not germane. In the 82d Congress, a bill(7) was under consideration which sought to amend the act of July 6, 1945, as amended, so as to reduce the number of grades for the var- ious positions under such act. The following amendment was offered to the bill:(8) Amendment offered by Mr. [Victor L.] Anfuso [of New York]: , after line 10, insert the fol- lowing:Sec. 4.

Postmasters, officers, and employees shall be granted 26 days' leave of absence with pay . .. each fiscal year and sick leave with pay at the rate of 15 days a year. ...'' A point of order was raised against the amendment, as fol- lows: MR. [T HOMAS J.] M URRAY [of Ten- nessee]: Mr. Chairman, I make the point of order that the amendment of- fered by the gentleman from New York is not germane to the pending bill. It does not pertain to any provision of the bill now under consideration which re- lates only to salary and to reassign- ment of the first three grades of Public Law 134. The Chairman,(9)in ruling on the point of order, stated: As the Chair stated before, this bill provides for the number of grades and positions in the postal field service and also provides salary increases for per- sonnel in such service. The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from New York deals neither with the number of grades or positions in the postal service nor with salary increases as such. It concerns an en- tirely different matter, namely, annual and sick leave.

Rights of Executive Branch EmployeesÐAmendment Af- fecting Legislative Branch Employees §35.95 Unless a bill so exten- sively amends existing law as to open up the entire law to amendment, the germane- ness of an amendment to the bill depends upon its rela- tionship to the subject of the bill and not to the entire law being amended; thus, to a bill amending a section of title 5, United States Code, granting certain rights to employees of executive agencies of the federal government, an amendment extending those rights to legislative branch employees, as defined in a different section of that title, was held to be beyond the scope of the bill and was ruled out as not germane. On Oct. 28, 1975,(10)during con- sideration of a bill(11)dealing with the right to representation for fed- eral executive employees during questioning, the Chair, in ruling that the amendment described above was not germane to thatbill, reiterated the principle that one individual proposition is not germane to another individual proposition, even though the two belong to the same class: The Clerk read as follows: Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That (a) chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end there- of the following new subchapter: ``SUBCHAPTER IIIÐEMPLOYEE RIGHTS ``§7171.

8949AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 Barbara Jordan (Tex.).immediately following the word ``agency'' the following: ``, or any em- ployee as defined under section 2107 of this Title.''. MR. C HARLES H. W ILSON of Cali- fornia: Madam Chairman, I have a point of order against the amendment. ... Madam Chairman, under rule XVI, clause 7, of the Rules of the House, any amendment to a bill concerning a subject different from those contained in the bill is not germane and is sub- ject to a point of order. The instant amendment proposes to make the bill applicable to a completely new class of employees other than what is covered under the bill, namely, congressional employees. However, the reported bill applies only to employees of executive agencies as defined under section 105. In my opinion, the subject of the amendment is not similar to any of the subject matters involved in H.R. 6227 which I have just outlined and is not germane. ... MR. B EARD of Tennessee: . .. Madam Chairman, I feel the amend- ment is germane to this particular bill inasmuch as the people we are includ- ing in this bill are Federal employees and those concerning whom we are leg- islating today are Federal employees. ... Madam Chairman, if I may be heard further on the point of order, all this does is to remove an exemption rather than add a group of employees. It is just removing an exemption, and I be- lieve that is the fair thing to do. THECHAIRMAN :(12)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. The bill before us is very explicit as to its scope. It includes any employeeof an executive agency. The bill itself, by its own terms, affects the class of civil servants known as executive agency employees. The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Tennessee (Mr. Beard) would seek to amend the bill by adding a totally different individual class of employees to the bill beyond the scope of the bill, namely, congressional em- ployees as defined in section 2107. The rule of germaneness, in terms of amendments of this kind, states as fol- lows: One individual proposition may not be amended by another individual proposition, even though the two be- long to the same class. In light of that principle and in light of the scope of this bill, the Chair rules that this amendment is not germane and is, therefore, out of order. ... MR. [J OHN H.] R OUSSELOT [of Cali- fornia]: Madam Chairman, respecting the chairperson's ruling, in regard to title V to which this bill addresses itself, an amendment to title V in- cludes all employees, including the President, Members of Congress, and members of the uniformed services, even though this bill has application, as the gentlewoman has said, only to Federal employees. Therefore, this title V does apply to all Federal employees. ... THECHAIRMAN : To the gentleman from California (Mr. Rousselot) the Chair would only state that the ger- maneness of the amendment must be weighed against the content and scope of the bill and not title V of the United States Code, as the gentleman would interpret it.

In the 76th Congress, a bill(13) was under consideration pro- posing to amend an act relating to the decennial census and the ap- portionment of Representatives in Congress. The following pro- ceedings took place on Apr. 11, 1940:(14) THECHAIRMAN :(15)... The Clerk will read. The Clerk read as follows: That an act to provide for the fif- teenth and subsequent decennial censuses and to provide for appor- tionment of Representatives in Con- gress, approved June 18, 1929, is hereby amended in the first sentence of section 22(a) by striking out the words ``second regular session of the Seventy-first Congress'' and sub- stituting the following words: ``first regular session of the Seventy-sev- enth Congress'', and by striking out ``fifteenth'' and inserting ``sixteenth.'' MR. [J AMES W.] M OTT [of Oregon]: Mr. Chairman, I offer the following amendment, which I send to the desk.The Clerk read as follows: ... The said act is further amended in the first sentence of section 22(a) by striking out the words, ``the then ex- isting number of Representatives'' and substituting the following words, ``300 Representatives.'' MR. [L INDSAY C.] W ARREN [of North Carolina]: Mr. Chairman, I make the point of order against the amendment that it is not germane. ... In ruling on the point of order, the Chairman, stated:(16) There is no question that the amend- ment would have been germane to the act of 1929. The precedents, however, seem to be very definite on the propo- sition that when a bill proposes to amend an act in several particulars an amendment proposing to modify the act but not related to the bill is not germane. ... The pending section of the bill does not in any way affect the total number of Members of the House but only pro- poses to change the time when the statement of the President must be transmitted to Congress. The Chair is of the opinion therefore that the amendment is not germane and sus- tains the point of order.

The amendments were agreed to. MR. [S TANFORD E.] P ARRIS [of Vir- ginia]: Mr. Chairman, I offer amend- ments and ask unanimous consent that the amendments be considered en bloc. THECHAIRMAN : Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Vir- ginia? There was no objection. The Clerk read as follows: Amendments offered by Mr. Par- ris: , at the end of section 313, insert the following: ``(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the District of Co- lumbia Council (established under Reorganization Plan Numbered 3 of 1967) and, after January 2, 1975, the Council of the District of Columbia established under the District of Co- lumbia Self-Government and Gov- ernmental Reorganization Act, shall have no authority to adopt any rule or regulation with respect to the uti- lization of parking facilities (includ- ing on-street and off-street parking) within the District of Columbia which is more restrictive upon non- residents of the District of Columbia than residents of the District of Co- lumbia. Notwithstanding any provi- sion of the District of Columbia Self- Government and Governmental Re- organization Act, the Council of the District of Columbia shall have no authority to modify or amend the provisions of this subsection.''MR. [C HARLES C.] D IGGS [Jr., of Michigan]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment on the ground that it is nongermane. The purpose of H.R. 15888 is to accom- plish several specific goals, including the development of low- and moderate- income housing, increase employment opportunities for District residents, and the development of substandard and blighted residential, commercial, and industrial areas in our National Capital in time for our Nation's Bicen- tennial. Clearly, the powers conferred on the proposed Corporation are spe- cifically subject to the limited and cir- cumscribed purpose in the provisions of the bill. Accordingly, we must read the powers of the bill contained in sec- tion 201 in the context of the purposes and findings contained in section 102. Nowhere do we find a statement that the Corporation may engage in estab- lishing parking facilities or the regula- tion thereof. To argue that the powers are so broad as to allow an amendment which purpose is to restrict the overall powers of the Council is, in my view, outside of the purposes of H.R. 15888 and therefore nongermane. ... Any amendment which seeks to deal with Council authority over parking in areas under the control of the United States or the District of Columbia gov- ernment, which would include the streets of the District, clearly goes be- yond the limited powers granted the Corporation under this act. Accord- ingly, it would be nongermane. ... MR. PARRIS : ...

8953AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 ment and Governmental Reorganiza- tion Act, as it relates to provisions of H.R. 15888. My amendment does no more and goes no further than does the amend- ment submitted by Mr. Fauntroy. With respect to the developmental powers that may be exercised by the District of Columbia Community De- velopment and Finance Corporation and according to the provisions of the act and as stated in the report on page 7, that corporation which is an instru- mentality of the District government may: Construct, manage or operate public facilities for the District gov- ernment or any other public body, at its request. As I read this and as any responsible man would read this, the District gov- ernment, if it wishes, could by enact- ment or regulation permit this instru- mentality of the District of Columbia, the District of Columbia Development and Finance Corporation, to manage and operate parking facilities in the District of Columbia, be they on public property such as those where meters now exist or other public property in residential areas where a ban on non- residential parking could be imposed. Item 17 on page 7 of the report indi- cated that the corporation may: Manage its own property, or to enter into agreement with the Dis- trict of Columbia government or a private entity for the management of property. Here again, this would certainly per- mit this corporation to engage in the management of on-street parking in the District of Columbia in either com- mercial or residential areas at the di-rection and discretion of the District of Columbia government and this cor- poration which is its instrumentality. ... Mr. Chairman, I submit that title II of H.R. 15888 is so broad and so gen- eral that it permits this corporation, which it establishes, to perform nearly any function that the District of Co- lumbia government itself could per- form, because by and large such pow- ers and authority could be delegated to it if, in fact, title II of the bill does not directly and expressly give those pow- ers to that corporation. ... THECHAIRMAN : The gentleman from Michigan makes a point of order against the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia. The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Virginia directly limits the powers of the present District of Columbia Council, and of the Council to be established under the Home Rule Act, to regulate all parking facilities within the District of Columbia. The bill H.R. 15888, which the gentleman's amendment seeks to amend, estab- lishes a Community Development and Finance Corporation and gives such corporation certain powers. It does not appear to the Chair that the scope of the bill extends to regulation, either by the Corporation or by the City Council, of all parking within the District of Co- lumbia. The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Virginia does not even mention the powers of the Corporation which is the primary subject of H.R. 15888, but limits instead the powers of the City Council. While a narrowly drawn amendment limiting the power of the Corporation to institute parking VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01573 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

8954DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 regulations over lands within its juris- diction might be germane, the issue of the overall powers of the District of Co- lumbia Council, as to all areas of regu- lation, is not comprehended in the bill. The gentleman from Virginia has ar- gued that the amendment already in- corporated into the bill is similar to his amendment, and that his amendment no more limits the powers of the Coun- cil or amends the Home Rule Act than does the adopted amendment. The new section 303, added by amendment of the gentleman from the District of Co- lumbia, only limits the powers of the Council as to the requirement that projects which the Corporation is au- thorized to undertake be submitted for approval to congressional committees. The new section 303 directly relates to the financing of projects authorized in the bill, and the section further states that the Council may not change the requirement of submission for congres- sional approval. It does not appear to the Chair that that provision in any way amends the powers of the Council under the Home Rule Act or that it touches on any subject not in the bill H.R. 15888. Section 313, added by committee amendment to specify that the bill does not preempt the legislative au- thority conferred on the City Council under the Home Rule Act, does not bring the subject of the general powers of the City Council under the Home Rule Act within the purview of the bill, except to the extent that the Council may or may not control the activities of the Corporation. For the reasons stated, the Chair sustains the point of order.Restrictions on Funds for Legal Services CorporationÐ Amendment Making Criminal and Civil Laws Applicable to Corporation §35.98 To a Senate amend- ment to a general appropria- tion bill subjecting funds for the Legal Services Corpora- tion to a comprehensive se- ries of restrictions on its ac- tivities for that fiscal year and reconstituting its board of directors, a proposed amendment also applying to that corporation ``with re- spect to the use of funds in the bill'' certain substantive provisions of Federal crimi- nal and civil law not other- wise applicable to it was held not germane.

In the 90th Congress, during consideration of the State Fire- arms Control Assistance Act of 1968,(19)an amendment was of- fered which stated in part:(20) Amendment offered by Mr. [Robert] McClory [of Illinois]: . . .

A point of order was raised against the amendment, as fol- lows:(1)MR. [J OHN D.] D INGELL [of Michi- gan]: Mr. Chairman, the fundamental purpose of the amendment must be germane to the bill. Here the amend- ment goes far beyond the purposes of the bill and imposes a whole new se- ries of responsibilities on the Sec- retary, including registration of fire- arms. . . . I submit, in conclusion, the [amend- ment] offered by my friend goes far be- yond the matter before the House, compels entirely new duties and re- sponsibilities, adds entirely new class- es of persons, creates entirely new reg- ulatory problems, and, indeed, ad- vances and enhances in enormous manner the scope of the bill, far be- yond that which was submitted to this body and far beyond that which was contemplated by the committee. The Chairman,(2)in ruling on the point of order, stated:(3) . . . [T]he bill which the Committee of the Whole is now considering seeks to regulate the various transactions in- volving rifles, shotguns, and handguns. It provides for the identification of such firearms by manufacturers and importers and, as amended by the Committee on the Judiciary and by this committee earlier this afternoon, specifies that this identification shall include serial numbers.

R EC. 20761, 90th Cong. 2d Sess., July 11, 1968.title 18, United States Code, the same portion of the Code amended by the pending bill. It carries the concept of registration or identification to the per- sons having handguns in their posses- sion. The system of registration estab- lished by the amendment would be under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Treasury, the same officer des- ignated for this purpose by the bill. The Chair notes that the bill makes at least three major innovations in the existing law concerning gun control: it extends that law with respect to trans- actions in rifles and shotguns; it brings ammunition within the scheme of the law; and it modifies the law regarding shipment and sale of destructive de- vices. Since present law is modified in the foregoing ways, an additional change in the law and the billÐa change that is an extension of a sub- ject already carried in the billÐis ger- mane. The Chair therefore overrules the point of order. Disposal of Surplus Military EquipmentÐAmendment Pro- hibiting Transfer of Surplus Guns §35.100 To a bill authorizing appropriations for military procurement and containing provisions modifying exist- ing law with respect to the disposal of surplus military equipment, an amendment proposing a further modi- fication of that law to pro- hibit the transfer of surplusguns and ammunition to in- dividuals, clubs or organiza- tions was held to be ger- mane.

A point of order was raised against the amendment, as fol- lows: MR. [D URWARD G.] H ALL [of Mis- souri]: ...[T]he amendment is out of order because this is an amendment pertaining to the domestic distribution of firearms and firefighting equipment. It is not consistent with the essence of the bill as prescribed under section 2576 and the actions of the Secretary of Defense. The Chairman,(7)in ruling on the point of order, stated: The whole section ...deals with obsolete and surplus military equip- ment. This is a further limitation on that.

In the 90th Congress, during consideration of a bill(8)amending Title 18 of the United States Code and making it a crime to travel in or use interstate facilities with the intent to incite a riot, an amendment was offered which sought to add to Title 18 a com- prehensive gun control law and to repeal the Federal Firearms Act, found in Title 15.(9)Mr. Edwin E.

GROSS : I have no reservation, I am making the point of order. MR. WILLIS : All right. The proponent of the amend- ment, Mr. Richard D. McCarthy, of New York, stated in response to the point of order: Mr. Chairman, this amendment is germane because the pattern of these riots is clear. Guerrilla warfare in the streets with snipers pouring deadly gunfire from roofs. ... After some further remarks, and in response to objections of Mr. Gross, the Chairman(11)made the request that Mr. McCarthy ``confine his remarks to the point of order.'' Speaking in support of the point of order, Mr. Willis stated:(12) The bill before the Committee is one which proscribes travel by people across State lines in furtherance of ri- oting. The amendment would add a new chapter, chapter 102, to title 18 of the Code under the subject of ``Riots.'' The words ``Chapter 102 of the Code'' are not even mentioned in this strange and completely disassociated amend- ment. ... The following exchange, di- rected to the point of order, con- cerned the meaning of the terms of the bill:MR. [A NDREW ] JACOBS [Jr., of Indi- ana]: ...If a rifle, which is an inte- gral part of effective and deadly riot, is shipped in interstate commerce, it seems to me that it does relate to a fa- cility in interstate or foreign com- merce, the shipment of which is with the intent to incite a riot or other vio- lent disturbance, and that therefore the amendment . .. is germane. ... MR. [T HOMAS S.] F OLEY [of Wash- ington]: ...[T]he use of ``facility'' in the bill before the committee is de- signed to mean a facility of transpor- tation or communication and not a fa- cility such as an instrument of fire- arms. ... The Chairman, in ruling on the point of order, stated: The committee has before it H.R. 421, a bill which adds a new chapter entitled ``Riots'' to title 18, United States Code, and it makes certain ac- tivities in interstate commerce unlaw- ful, and specific penalties are provided. The amendment offered by the gen- tleman from New York [Mr. McCarthy] makes unlawful certain actions and deals in sale and transportation in interstate and foreign commerce of firearms or ammunition. The amend- ment provides a comprehensive legisla- tive scheme for control for interstate shipment of firearms. The Chair feels that the amendment comes within the rule of germaneness, wherein it is said that one individual proposition may not be amended by an- other individual proposition even though the two belong to the same class. ... ...[T]he Chair feels that while [the bill and the amendment] are simi- VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01578 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

Diverse Amendments to Laws Relating to Intelligence Com- munityÐAmendments Relat- ing to Accountability for In- telligence Activities §35.102 To a proposition deal- ing with a subject matter by diverse changes in existing laws, an amendment relating to that same general subject matter may be germane al- though including additional changes in law not contained in the bill; thus, to a bill au- thorizing funding for the in- telligence community for one fiscal year and making di- verse changes in permanent laws relating to the intel- ligence community (includ- ing laws concerning congres- sional oversight of certain in- telligence activities), an amendment changing an- other permanent law to ad- dress accountability for in- telligence activities was held germane.

The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mrs. Boxer: , after line 18, insert the fol- lowing new title: TITLE VIÐOVERSIGHT OF INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES SEC. 601. CONGRESSIONAL OVER - SIGHT . (a) In General.ÐSection 501 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 413) is amended to read as follows: ``CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT ``Sec. 501. (a) The President shall ensure that the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on In- telligence of the House of Represent- atives (hereinafter in this title re- ferred to as the ``intelligence commit- tees'') are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the United States including any significant anticipated intelligence activities, as required by this title, except thatÐ ``(1) nothing contained in this title shall be construed as requiring the approval of the intelligence commit- tees as a condition precedent to the initiation of intelligence gathering activities. ... ``(b) The President, upon being made aware of any allegations of il- legal intelligence activity, shall im- mediately report such allegations to the intelligence committees and keep the intelligence committees informed of the ongoing investigations into such activities, such reports to en- compass any measures taken to pre-vent a recurrence of such illegal ac- tivity, including the reporting of such activity to the Department of Justice for prosecution. ``(c) The President and the intel- ligence committees shall each estab- lish procedures as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this title, including procedures to ensure that each is kept fully and currently informed of intelligence activities. ``(d) The House of Representatives and the Senate, in consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence, shall each establish, by rule or reso- lution of such House, procedures to ensure that all members of the Con- gress are informed regarding intel- ligence activities to the extent con- sistent with the need to protect from unauthorized disclosure classified in- formation and information relating to intelligence sources and methods furnished to the intelligence commit- tees or to Members of Congress under this title.

MR. [H ENRY J.] H YDE [of Illinois]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order that the amendment violates clause 7 of rule XVI. . . . The proposed amend- ment is not germane to the bill be- cause it deals with matters beyond the scope of the bill's provisions and the amendment includes matters within the jurisdiction of committees of the House not reporting the bill under con- sideration. Mr. Chairman, the amendment is not germane, and consequently violates clause 7 of rule XVI in the following specific respects: First, the bill authorizes funds for a limited number of executive depart- ments or their subcomponents speci- fied in section 101 of the bill and makes a few very modest changes in the statutory authorities of only a few of those agencies. The amendment would enact a com- prehensive scheme of oversight and re- porting requirements for all U.S. intel- ligence activities which are engaged in by any U.S. Government agency, not VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01582 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

8963AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 just those covered by the bill, as well as by third parties outside of the U.S. Government. (Amndt: p. 4, lines 6±12.) In this regard, I call attention to a ruling by the Chair on September 27, 1967 (113 Cong. Rec. page 26957) cited in section 798f of the Rules and Prac- tice of the House of Representatives. That ruling states that, ``To a bill lim- ited in its applicability to certain de- partments and agencies of government, an amendment applicable to all depart- ments and agencies is not germane.'' Second, the only provision of the bill addressing congressional oversight of intelligence is section 503. That provi- sion is limited to oversight related only to one specific and narrow class of in- telligence activities, and that is com- mercial cover activities to provide secu- rity only for intelligence collection. Moreover, section 503 of the bill ap- plies only to elements of one executive department, the Defense Department, and the provision expires at the end of 5 years. The amendment goes far beyond that one new and specifically limited over- sight subject in the bill. The amend- ment provides for a comprehensive oversight system for intelligence activi- ties of the U.S. Government in general, and in some cases the role of outside third parties. The amendment is also not limited in duration, as is section 503 of the bill, but is broader because it would enact a permanent statutory change. In these regards, the amend- ment is not germane because it is more general in nature than the only provi- sion of the bill which deals with one particular and narrow class within the general subject of intelligence over- sight reporting. The amendment further requires, as part of its oversight scheme, that theHouse and Senate establish certain procedures by adopting internal rules or resolutions, matters not dealt with in any form by the bill. (Amndt: page 3, lines 4±18.) Third, the amendment is not ger- mane because its text consists entirely of provisions repealing or amending sections of two statutes not amended or addressed by the bill under consid- eration. The amendment extensively amends title V of the National Security Act of 1947, codified in title 50 of the United States Code, and repeals section 662 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, codified in title 22 of the United States Code. The bill does not amend either of those statutes, and indeed, does not amend any part of title 22 of the United States Code. Section 799 of the Rules and Practice of the House of Representatives cites a ruling by the Chair on May 11, 1976, that, ``Generally to a bill amending one existing law, an amendment changing the provisions of another law . .. is not germane.'' Precedents cited in sec- tions 33.1 and 33.3 of chapter 28 of Procedures in the U.S. House of Rep- resentatives, 97th Congress, 4th Edi- tion (Deschler and Brown) support this principle with which the proposed amendment is inconsistent. Furthermore, chapter 28, section 14 of Deschler and Brown's Proce- dures in the U.S. House of Representa- tives, 97th Congress, 4th Edition cites a precedent from a ruling of March 7, 1974 (120 Cong Rec. 5653, 5654, 93rd Cong. 2nd Sess.) that, ``An amendment repealing existing law has been held not germane to a bill not amending that law.''

8964DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 Bill Nelson (Fla.).tion of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, a statute not amended by the bill, the proposed amendment is not germane. (Amndt: page 1, lines 3±4.) Fourth, the amendment is not ger- mane because it fails the test of com- mittee jurisdiction under section 798c of the Rules and Practice of the House of Representatives by including mat- ters within the jurisdiction of commit- tees not reporting the bill, the Com- mittee on Foreign Affairs and Rules. The amendment would repeal sec- tion 662 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. That act is within the jurisdic- tion of the Foreign Affairs Committee. (Amndt: page 1, lines 3±4.) The amendment also would require the House (and one of its committees) to establish certain internal procedures by the adoption of House rules or reso- lutions. Such matters are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Rules. (Amndt: p. 3, lines 4±18.) Fifth, the amendment (at p. 8, lines 8±12) would create a penal offense, whereas the pending bill does not deal with or create any criminal offenses. In addition, the committees reporting the bill do not have jurisdiction to consider such matters. In that regard, I would call the attention of the Chair to a precedent of the House, rulings by the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, Mr. Forand on April 7, 1960. In those rulings, the Chair sustained points of order against two amend- ments to a pending amendment in the nature of a substitute to a bill relating to employment of retired officers by Defense contractors reported from the Armed Services Committee. Those points of order were sustained by the Chair, which ruled that the substitutesdealt with the imposition of criminal penalties, a matter not dealt with in the proposition being amended. Fur- ther, the Chair ruled that the sub- stitutes' imposition of criminal pen- alties was a matter outside the juris- diction of the committee which had re- ported the pending bill [Armed Serv- ices] and, if offered as a separate bill, would have to be referred to the Com- mittee on the Judiciary. For all the reasons given and in light of the precedents cited, the amendment is not germane, and therefore it vio- lates clause 7 of rule XVI. I insist upon my point of order, Mr. Chairman. . . . MRS. BOXER : . . . We feel it is abso- lutely germane. We feel that there are other provisions in the bill, for example on page 26 and page 33 that talk about permanent changes in law, and we would say that this is absolutely ger- mane. My goodness, we are talking about covert activities, and certainly the In- telligence Committee, and it is hard for me to believe that someone could say that a discussion of covert activities in this particular amendment would not be germane to the intelligence author- ization bill. . . . MR. [A NTHONY C.] B EILENSON [of California]: . . . I recognize the right of the gentleman, of course, to make this point of order and, in fact, I do not know how the Chair will rule on the precedents which the gentleman from Illinois has cited. I would only ask that in its ruling the Chair consider the fact that there are already provisions in the bill which do broaden its scope. . . . THECHAIRMAN :(15). . . The Chair is prepared to rule.

8965AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) makes the point of order that the amendment offered by the gentle- woman from California is not germane to the bill. The amendment adds a new title and must be germane to the bill as a whole, as amended. The bill authorizes funding for the intelligence community for 1 fiscal year and makes several, diverse changes in permanent law relating to sundry au- thorities of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of De- fense. For example, the bill makes changes in the CIA retirement and dis- ability system; it authorizes the Sec- retary of Defense to permit compo- nents of DOD to charge the CIA the same rate for airlift services that they would charge another component of DOD; and it authorizes the Secretary of Defense to withhold certain geodetic products from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. In addi- tion, the bill, as perfected, includes the amendment recommended by the Com- mittee on Armed Services directing the Secretary of Defense to provide Mem- bers of Congress access to a classified report of the Defense Intelligence Agency assessing efforts to account for military personnel listed as prisoners of war or missing in action. The amendment at the desk does not repeal the Hughes-Ryan law, but does amend title V of the National Security Act of 1947Ðrelating to accountability for intelligence activities. Among other things, it assigns to the President sev- eral responsibilities of the type that the existing act assigns to lower offi- cials, such as the Director of Central Intelligence. Although the bill does not amend the National Security Act of 1947, neitherdoes it confine itself to authorities and activities of the intelligence commu- nity. In addition to the changes in per- manent law already noted, at section 503 the bill inserts new provisions in title 10 of the United States CodeÐre- lating to the Armed ForcesÐto ensure congressional oversight of activities of the Department of Defense in commer- cial cover of intelligence operations. Thus, the subject matter of the amendmentÐthe relationship between the executive branch and the Congress with respect to the authorities and ac- tivities of the intelligence communityÐ is one of the diverse topics already ad- dressed in the bill. Accordingly, the point of order is overruled. MR. HYDE: Mr. Chairman, may I ask one question? Mr. Chairman, I did not hear that part, what the Chair read about the criminal penalties that she inserts in the law, and my point that that should go to the Committee on the Judiciary, that it is certainly beyond the scope of our bill. I must have missed that. How did the Chair rule on that, sir? THECHAIRMAN : The Chair thinks that the bill, as presented and amend- ed contains provisions within several committee jurisdictions. Therefore the amendment need not meet a strict ju- risdictional test. Accordingly, the Chair rules that the point of order is over- ruled. Parliamentarian's Note: Mr. Hyde's point of order anticipated inclusion in the Boxer amendment of a provision repealing the so- called ``Hughes-Ryan'' amendment VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01585 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

8966DESCHLER -BROWN PRECEDENTS Ch. 28 §35 84 C ONG. REC. 8715, 76th Cong. 1st Sess. Under consideration was H.R. 6634 (Committee on Flood Control).to the Foreign Assistance Act (22 U.S.C. 2422), a law not amended by the bill and within the partial jurisdiction of another committee (Foreign Affairs). The offered amendment did not include that proposed repeal but did include the criminal provision cited in the point of order. As indicated in the Chair's follow-up response, it was only because of the diverse nature of the bill that the criminal provi- sion was held germane. (Compare Apr. 7, 1960, rulings in sections 39 and 4.40, supra, cited by Mr. Hyde.) In those cases the points of order were sustained that the criminal sanction provisions con- tained in the amendments at- tempted to attain a result by a method unrelated to the narrow purpose of the bill. The pending proposition in those cases was not diverse and therefore not suscep- tible to the amendments ruled out. Bill Amending 1937 Flood Con- trol ActÐAmendment To Amend 1936 Act §35.103 To a bill proposing to amend the Flood Control Act of 1937, an amendment pro- posing to amend the Flood Control Act of 1936 was held to be not germane, the act of 1936 having been enacted for purposes not related to the bill.The ruling described above was made on July 6, 1939.(16)Pro- ceedings were as follows: The Clerk called the bill (H.R. 6634) amending previous flood-control acts and authorizing certain preliminary examinations and surveys for flood control, and for other purposes. There being no objection, the Clerk read the bill as follows: Be it enacted, etc., That section 2 of the Flood Control Act of August 28, 1937, is hereby amended to read as follows: ``That the Secretary of War is hereby authorized to allot not to ex- ceed $300,000 from any appropria- tions heretofore or hereafter made for any one fiscal year for flood con- trol, for removing accumulated snags and other debris and clearing chan- nels in navigable streams and tribu- taries thereof when in the opinion of the Chief of Engineers such work is advisable in the interest of flood con- trol: Provided , That not more than $25,000 shall be allotted for this pur- pose for any single tributary from the appropriations for any one fiscal year.'' Sec. 2.

8967AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 hereby made applicable to author- ized works of flood control. ... MR. [L OUIS L.] L UDLOW [of Indiana]: Mr. Speaker, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. Lud- low: On page 2, after the word ``de- partment'' in line 12, insert a new section, as follows: ``Sec. 3. Section 3 of the act enti- tled `An act authorizing the construc- tion of certain public works on rivers and harbors for flood control, and for other purposes', approved June 22, 1936, as amended, is amended by adding before the period at the end thereof a colon and the following: `And provided further, That if, after investigation, the President finds that any city or town is, by reason of its financial condition, unable to comply with the requirements of this section as to local cooperation, he is hereby authorized to waive such re- quirements on any individual levee or flood-wall project not to exceed 50 percent of the estimated costs of the lands, easements, and rights-of- way.' '' ``The first paragraph of section 2 of the act entitled `An act authorizing the construction of certain public works on rivers and harbors for flood control, and for other purposes, ap- proved June 28, 1938, is amended to read as follows: ```That section 3 of the act of June 22, 1936 (Public, No. 738, 74th Cong.), as heretofore amended, as herein further modified, and as amended after June 28, 1938, shall apply to all flood-control projects, ex- cept as otherwise specifically pro- vided by law.' '' MR. [W ILLIAM M.] W HITTINGTON [of Mississippi]: Mr. Speaker, I make the point of order that, as I said, this amendment is not germane to the bill. The bill undertakes to amend the Flood Control Act of 1937 and theFlood Control Act of 1938. They are perfecting amendments. The gentle- man's amendment is an amendment to the act of 1936, that is in no way in- volved in this bill, as it relates to local contributions for levees and flood walls. So I make the point of order that the amendment is not germane to the bill under consideration or any section thereof. THESPEAKER PROTEMPORE [Sam Rayburn, of Texas]: The Chair is ready to rule. MR. [C ASSIUS C.] D OWELL [of Iowa]: Mr. Speaker, the amendment sub- mitted by the gentleman from Indiana merely asks to relieve the city from the payment of what is due under the law and is in no way germane to the ques- tion before the House. THESPEAKER PROTEMPORE : The Chair is ready to rule. The bill before the House is a bill to amend the Flood Control Act of 1937. That act had one purpose. The Flood Control Act of 1936 had another pur- pose. The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Ludlow) offers an amendment as an amendment to the Flood Control Act of The amendment clearly is not germane to this bill, and the Chair sustains the point of order.

8969AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE Ch. 28 §35 See § 42.32, infra. 19.B. F. Sisk (Calif.).retary of Interior may determine are required to insure that actions au- thorized, funded, or carried out by them, relating to the Missouri Basin Power Project do not jeopardize the continued existence of such endan- gered species and threatened species or result in the destruction or modi- fication of habitat of such species which is or has been determined to be critical, by the Secretary of the Interior, after consultation as appro- priate with the affected States.''. .. MR. RONCALIO : Mr. Chairman, I can- not imagine how a point of order could be reserved on the amendment at this point. The precise objections to the last amendment(18)were stricken from this amendment, and this amendment is left with a citation of only one statute, and that is the Endangered Species Act, which is precisely the statute be- fore us at this time. I cannot imagine an attack on the germaneness provi- sion at this point. I have stricken from my first amend- ment all reference to the Army Corps of Engineers, all reference to the Na- tional Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and all reference to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. There is only one act cited in the amendment, and that is precisely the one before us.... MR. [J OHN J.] C AVANAUGH [of Ne- braska]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment on the basis that the amendment is not ger- mane to the bill. The differences be- tween this amendment and the amend- ment previously offered are that the gentleman from Wyoming has stricken specific references in the first portionof his amendment to the National En- vironmental Policy Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and the Rural Electrification Act, but the gen- tleman's amendment has not stricken new responsibilities imposed upon the Rural Electrification Administration, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Secretary of the Interior. The amendment would continue to require biological opinion by the Fish and Wildlife Service, and require addi- tional duties of responsible officers of the REA, the Corps of Engineers; to re- quire modifications of the project. In addition, it requires the Secretary of the Interior to consult with the ap- propriate affected states, which would also be a new obligation not envisioned in the act imposed upon agencies of Government. In addition to that, the amendment is not germane to the sec- tion. It appears as a new section fol- lowing section 32, a section dealing with certain antique articles. So, I would renew my point of order as to germaneness both to the bill and to the section. THECHAIRMAN :(19)The Chair is pre- pared to rule. Actually, the amendment adds a new section, let the Chair say to the gen- tleman from Nebraska, which in the opinion of the Chair would need only be germane to the bill as a whole. However, the earlier matter cited by the gentleman from Nebraska in his point of order dealing with the ex- panded authority and responsibilities and obligations of the Rural Elec- trification Administration and Army VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01589 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02

Therefore, the Chair would have to sustain the point of order on the basis that it would still expand authorities which are not within the coverage of the bill. §36. Amendment Repeal- ing Existing Law to Bill Amending That Law To a bill amending existing law in one particular,(20)or in a lim- ited respect,(1)an amendment re- pealing the law is not germane. Thus, to a bill establishing a new office within a government depart- ment, an amendment to abolish the department is not germane.(2) Similarly, to an amendment pro- posing to amend existing law in some particulars, an amendment proposing to repeal the law in its entirety is not germane,(3)unless the proposition being amended changes law in a comprehensive and diverse way, in which case an amendment proposing repeal of the law may be germane.(4)And to a bill referring to certain provi- sions of existing law, an amend- ment repealing a portion of thatlaw has been held not to be ger- mane.(5) Continuing Tax Exemptions for Property Used by Govern- mentÐAmendment Repealing Other Exemptions §36.1 To a bill to continue the tax-exempt status of certain property owned by others but used and occupied by government agencies or by the Red Cross, an amend- ment seeking to repeal the law granting tax exemptions with respect to property oc- cupied by the Daughters of the American Revolution was held not to be germane. In the 79th Congress, a bill(6) was under consideration which stated in part as follows:(7) Whereas in times of national stress it is necessary for the United States of America and its various instrumental- ities to use and occupy additional space necessary for the proper execu- tion of their enlarged functions: There- fore be it Resolved, etc., That the use and occu- pancy of real property in the District of Columbia by any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States of America, or by the American Red VerDate 18-JUN-99 14:36 Sep 22, 1999 Jkt 010199 PO 00000 Frm 01590 Fmt 8875 Sfmt 8875 E:\RENEE\52093C28.TXT txed02 PsN: txed02
