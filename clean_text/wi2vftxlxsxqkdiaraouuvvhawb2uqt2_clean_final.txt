2-ooOoo- R.W. (father) appeals from Ap ril 2009 orders terminating parental rights (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 366.26) to his two children.1 Earlier this summer, father’s appointed appellate counsel informed this court by letter that counsel wa s not filing an opening brief for lack of any arguable issue ( In re Sade C. (1996) 13 Cal.4th 952). This court in turn extended time for father to personally file a letter brief, which he has since done. In his letter brief, father asks us to allow him the chance to pr ove he can be a supportive and stable parent to his children. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY Father was incarcerated for virtually all of his children’s dependency.2 He had been sentenced to state prison following a false imprisonment conviction (Pen. Code, § 236). In addition, father had a prior viol ent felony conviction fo r first degree robbery (Pen. Code, § 212.5, subd. (a )). Based on his violent felony conviction and a showing of detriment to the children if services were ordered while he was incarcerated, the court denied appellant reunification services. (§ 361.5, subds. (b)(12) & (e)(1).) Although the court did order services fo r the children’s mother, she failed to regularly participate in court-ordered services and made unsatisfactor y progress. In light of her nonparticipation and the children’s you ng ages (see § 361.5, subd. (a)), the court terminated reunification services following a six-month status review hearing. It also set a hearing pursuant to section 366.26 to sel ect and implement a permanent plan for the children. 1 All statutory references are to the We lfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise indicated. 2 The Merced County Superi or Court exercised its dependency jurisdiction over the children based upon their moth er’s substance abuse and fath er’s inability to provide care for the children.

3Days before the section 366.26 hearing, appellant was released from prison. At the section 366.26 hearing, appe llant testified he wanted cu stody of his children despite the fact he admittedly had no contact with them while he was incarcerated. DISCUSSION Appellant’s allegations do not amount to claims that th e juvenile court committed an error affecting the outcome of this case ( In re Sade C., supra, 13 Cal.4th at p. 994). Consequently, we will affirm. An appealed-from judgment or or der is presumed correct. ( Denham v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564.) It is up to appe llant to raise claims of reversible error or other defect and present argument and aut hority on each point made. If appellant does not do so, the appeal shou ld be dismissed. ( In re Sade C., supra, 13 Cal.4th at p. 994.) With no error or other defect claimed agai nst the orders appealed from, we have no reason to reverse or even modify the orders in question. ( Ibid.) In this case, appellant fails to allege any error on the trial court’s part. To the extent appellant assumes the court erred by not giving him the opportunity to reunify with his children upon his prison rele ase, he fails to cite any legal authority to support his position and we are unaware of an y such authority. He also ignores the children’s rights at this stage of the dependency proceedings. At the permanency planning phase, a pare nt’s interest in the care, custody and companionship of the child is no longer pa ramount. The court’s focus shifts to the children’s best interests and their ne ed for permanency and stability. ( In re Marilyn H. (1993) 5 Cal.4th 295, 309.) Appe llant’s desire to now be a father to his children does not address the children’s interests. In addition, a section 366.26 hearing is designed to protect children’s compelling rights to have a placement that is stable, perman ent, and that allows the caretaker to make a full emotional commitmen t to the children. ( In re Marilyn H., supra, 5 Cal.4th at p. ) In fact, there is a rebu ttable presumption that continue d out-of-home care is in the

4best interests of the children. ( In re Stephanie M. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 295, 318.) If, as in this case, the children are likel y to be adopted, termination of parental rights and adoption are the norm. ( In re Celine R. (2003) 31 Cal.4th 45, 53.) Thus, appellant’s assumption that the trial court should have given him the o pportunity to reunify at this late stage of the proceedings is meritless. DISPOSITION The orders terminating pa rental rights are affirmed.
