IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT No. 14 -50358 Summary Calendar UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff - Appellee v. JOSE RAUL BRUNO-SANDOVAL , Defendant - Appellant Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas USDC No. 2:13 -CR- 929-1 Before SMITH, BARKSDALE, and PRADO, Circuit Judges. PER CURIAM: * In contesting his 52-month within-advisory Sentencing Guidelines- sentence, imposed following his conviction for illegal reentry, in violation of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1326(a) & 1326(b)(1)(2), Jose Raul Bruno-Sandoval challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, asserti ng it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing objectives of 1 8 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In support, he contends the district court’s application of Guideline § 2L1.2 (the * Pursuant to 5 th Cir.

No. 14 -50358 illegal reentry G uideline) double-counts his prior conviction and fails to account for the nonviolent nature of his offense, which he describes as an “international trespass”. Bruno also asserts the district court failed to account for his personal circumstances and the circumstances of this offense. In that regard, he stat es he returned to the United States for family reasons. Although , at sentencing, Bruno objected to the substantive reason- ableness of his sentence, subject to review for abuse of discretion, Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007), he claims, for the first time on appeal, that his sentence is substantively unreasonable as a result of Guideline § 2L1.2. Therefore , regarding § 2L1.2, review is only for plain error. E.g., United States v. Rodriguez, 15 F.3d 408, 414 (5th Cir. 1994 ). Under that standard, Bruno must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his substantial rights. Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 135 (2009). If he does so, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it seriousl y affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. Id. Nevertheless, regardless of whether review is for plain error or abuse of discretion, Bruno has identified no reversible error. Bruno acknowledges his challenge to Guideline § 2L1.2 is foreclosed; he raises it only to preserve it for possible future review. E.g., United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, 564 F.3d 357, 366 -367 (5th Cir. 2009). Our court has also rejected his “double-counting” claim. E.g., United States v. Duarte, 569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir. 2009). Similarly, our court is un persuaded by the contention that the Guidelines fail to account for the nonviolent nature of an illegal reentry offense. E.g., United States v. Aguirre-Villa, 460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir. 2006). The district court considered Bruno ’s request for a lesser sentence but found that a sentence in the middle of the Guidelines -sentencing range was 2 Case: 14-50358 Document: 00512890316 Page: 2 Date Filed: 01/06/2015

No. 14 -50358 appropriate. His contentions regarding mitigating factors and benign motive do not rebut the presumption of reasonableness. E.g., United States v. Cooks, 589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir. 2009); United States v. Gomez- Herrera , 523 F.3d 554, 565 -66 (5th Cir. 2008). AFFIRMED. 3 Case: 14-50358 Document: 00512890316 Page: 3 Date Filed: 01/06/2015
