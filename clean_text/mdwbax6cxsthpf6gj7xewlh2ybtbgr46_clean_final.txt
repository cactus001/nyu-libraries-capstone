The training was developed based in the experiences of the membership of Make the Road New York – for low-wage Latino immigrant workers, m any of whom are undocumented. They work in businesses including restaurants, delis and groceries, small factories, non-union construction, retail, home health care, domestic wo rk, among others. Many work in very small businesses – often with 10 or fewer employees. Few enjoy the protections afforded by a union in their job. For many, unsafe working conditions are a routine r eality on the job – as is the real risk of retaliation, if workers speak out to the boss. Lik ewise, for many supporting families here and in their home country, an unsafe job may seem better t han the risk of no job at all. It is in this context that we hope to arm community leaders with a realistic, relevant orientation around health and safety issues. There is an empha sis in this training on group work and group problem solving – and a goal to identify those step s workers can take together to improve their working conditions, with or without the knowledge o r support of the boss. It is important for workers to understand that the law protects them ag ainst retaliation for complaining about unsafe conditions, regardless of immigration status . However, workers should also understand that if they are fired in retaliation, it may be di fficult to win their job back if they lack status. Likewise, workers should also understand that the l aw affords fairly narrow protections for refusing to perform work that is unsafe. Where unsafe working conditions exist, the goal is to help workers connect to resources such as community organizations like Make the Road – so wor kers can get the support and back-up to take action, including reporting conditions to gove rnment agencies such as OSHA, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. This program is designed for workers with varying l evels of formal education and literacy in their native language. Group participatory activit ies, pictures, and other formats ensure that all workers can actively and equally participate in the exercises.

It does not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the U.S. Departmen t of Labor, nor does mention of trade names, commercial products, o r organizations imply endorsement by the U.S. Gover nment. 2 Finally, this training covers the most fundamental rights of workers under the federal OSH Act, and is intended for workers who work primarily in w hat OSHA classifies as “miscellaneous.” OSHA issues very detailed regulations for many spec ific jobs, and many specific hazards, that are beyond the scope of this training. For more de tailed information to supplement these exercises, trainers are encouraged to read the Introduction to OSHA Instructor Guide published by OSHA on its website. 1 The OSHA website has many useful resources for wo rkers as well. 2 About Make the Road New York: Make the Road New York is a community-based nonprof it organization with centers in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and Suffolk County Long Island, New York. Make the Road New York builds the power of Latino and working cla ss communities to achieve dignity and justice through organizing, policy innovation, tran sformative education, and survival services. The organization’s nearly 9,000 members – primarily low-income Latino immigrants – tackle the key issues facing their communities, including work place justice, tenants’ rights, civil rights, public education, health care access, adult literac y, and workforce development. For more than 14 years, Make the Road has focused in particular o n helping low-wage immigrant workers enforce their most basic rights on the job – from r eceiving the minimum wage and overtime to ensuring a healthy and safe work environment. This training is designed to help organizations across the country work with community leaders and activists, to learn about workers’ rights to a safe work environment and strategies to protectin g their own safety and health. Acknowledgments: Make the Road New drew from many wonderful resource s to create this training. In particular, the exercises with graphics included below are modi fied from similar exercises included in the English as a Second Language curriculum created by the New York Committee on Occupational Safety & Health (NYCOSH) entitled Taking Action for a Safe Workplace: Materials for E nglish Language Learner Teachers (2005).

It is best to have the group sit in a circle for large group activities. For sm all group work, make sure there is sufficient space for people to spread out. /checkbld/checkbld /checkbld/checkbld Managing Questions: Post a large sheet of butcher paper at the start of the day, labeled “ Questions ” or “Preguntas” (in Spanish). Encourage participant s to ask questions as you proceed. If a question is not related to the immed iate topic, or if you do not know the answer yourself, have them write the quest ion up on the sheet (or write it for them, if they do not feel comfortable writing). At the end of the training, run through the list and see how many que stions are not yet answered. Prepare to return with an answer yourself, or assig n research to participants. /checkbld/checkbld /checkbld/checkbld Group Dynamic Establish a practice to encourage “Step Up/Step Bac k.” Participants who speak often should be encouraged to “step back” so others may contribute. Participants who are shy about offering ideas shoul d be encouraged to “step up.” In group discussions, wait to call on someone a second time until all others have had a chance to speak. Also consider gender b alance – ensure that all participate equally in group discussions. /checkbld/checkbld /checkbld/checkbld Ground Rules Have the group establish ground rules that you writ e up at the front of the room. Good rules include shutting off cell phones, respec t for everyone’s ideas, “one voice” (only one person speaks at a time), and main taining the confidentiality of what is shared in the group. /checkbld/checkbld /checkbld/checkbld Visuals It is very useful to post visuals and information a round the meeting space. You can post “teasers” – such single-word signs includi ng “OSHA,” “HAZARD,” and “SAFE,” as well as signs with statistics you will r eview (injury rates, etc.).

It can be shortened, and completed in a single day, or broken into two portions spread over two days. D A Y O N E – A P P R O X . 5 H O U R S 1 ) IN T R O D U C T I O N S & OV E R V I E W 3 5 M I N U T E S a. Introduce yourself & role with the organization b. Introduce the host organization, e.g.: Make the Road New York builds the power of Latino and working class communities to achieve dignity and justice through organizing, policy innovation, transformative education, and survival services. With nearly 9,00 0 members at our four community-based centers, we organize around workers ’ rights issues – including helping workers fight to for workplaces that are sa fe and healthy. c. Go around the circle asking participants to introdu ce themselves by sharing: i. Their name ii. Their current job (or a recent job, if not working) iii. A movement that typifies what they do at work. (Yo u can kick of the round by demonstrating: for instance, “I am a teacher” – and mime some aspect of teaching.) /barb2right Keep track of names and jobs/industries. You may divide groups according to jobs later in the day, if participants divide neatl y into separate industries. d. Review the brief agenda & goals for the day Goal: For this group of community leaders and activists to learn about workplace hazards; workers’ legal rights to a safe workplace; and tactics and strategies workers can use to minimize risks in the workplace. As lea ders, participants will have the duty to share what they have learned with family, f riends, and co-workers. Ask participants to add any other goals to this ba sic mission statement. Ask participants to set “Ground Rules” for the day – using the basics outlined above as a starting point.

You will read a s eries of questions and ask those answering “yes” to physically signal their response without s peaking. /head2right Step In/Step Out format. Ask everyone to stand in a large circle. Those answering “yes” to the question should take one ste p into the circle, while those answering “no” remain where they are. /head2right Stand Up/Sit Down format. If you do not have a lo t of room, ask participants to simply stand up if their answer is “yes,” or to remain seated if “no.” Questions (create more question as are relevant to your parti cipants) 1) I have had to do work that I thought was unsafe at least once in a job. 2) I have seen others do work that I thought was unsaf e. 3) I have been hurt on the job. 4) I have seen someone else get hurt on the job. 5) I have been hurt on the job so badly I had to go to the doctor. 6) I know someone who has been hurt so badly on the jo b they had to go to the doctor. Reflection: How do participants feel having done the exercise? What do they think about it? 3 ) UN K N O W N FA C T O R Y ST O R Y 3 0 M I N U T E S GOAL : This activity is intended to set the historical stage for worker safety and health issues, and to familiarize participants with phrases such a s “workplace safety,” “hazard,” and “occupational safety.” The handout [ Handout #1: Factory Story ] is the story of the historic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which occurred in 1911 near Washington Square Park in Manhattan. 3 Note: the participant handout does not include the date, the name of the factory, the location, or any details about the workers. Have participant s read the story aloud – and answer the discussion questions included on the handout and be low. This exercise is intended to show workers how worker safety and health risks continue – despite tragedies like this fire. Pass out Handout #1 to the group. If all participa nts are comfortable reading aloud, have each participant read 1-2 sentences, going around in a c ircle until the entire story is completed. If some participants are unable to read, ask for volun teers to read the story aloud. 3 For more detailed information about this event, se e http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/trianglefire/ .

What borough or neighborhood? 2) What kind of factory do you think it was? 3) What year do you think it happened? 4) How many days a week and hours a day do you think t hese workers worked? 5) Who do you think these workers were? Where were th ey from? Were the men or women? How old do you think they were? 6) What are some of the reasons this disaster happened ? As you facilitate a discussion, fill in the actual facts of the tragedy: • The fire took place in New York City on March 25, 1 911. • The factory was located at 23-29 Washington Place, between Greene Street and Washington Square East in Manhattan, New York City (Greenwich Village). • The Triangle Waist Company was one of the largest b louse makers in New York City, specializing in “shirtwaists,” the very popul ar women's blouse of the era. • 146 people died as a result of the fire: 129 women and 17 men. • Many of the workers were young women, most of them Italian and European Jewish immigrants between 16 and 23 years old. Som e were as young as 14. • They worked nine hours a day on weekdays, plus seve n hours on Saturdays (notably less than many garment factory workers tod ay). Current Day Snap Shot [Handout #2] End by reviewing statistics about injury rates toda y, for example:4 /square4 In 2009, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics rep orted an average of 12 workers were killed every day on the job in the U.S. (Total 4,340 workers a yea r.) /square4 That same year, another 50,000 were killed from occ upational disease – diseases caused by conditions at work. /square4 Estimates suggest that about 8 million to 12 millio n job injuries or illnesses occur every year. /square4 Latino workers continued to have a greater risk of job fatalities. There were 668 fatalities among Latino workers. Of those, 59% (39 3) were born outside the U.S. /square4 The first federal law to protect workers’ health an d safety on the job was not passed until 1970 – nearly 60 years after the Triangle Shi rtwaist Factory Fire. Discussion : Spend a few minutes asking workers to comment on why so many workers are still hurt on the job and why the rates of fatalities are higher for Latino workers. 4 Statistics taken from the AFL-CIO Report Death on the Job: The Toll of Neglect , April 2001.

GROUP BRAINSTORM: Ask for volunteers to give exampl es of a “hazard” on the job that might cause harm to a worker’s safety or health. They ca n use examples from their own jobs, or using their imagination. If participants give an example of an injury, e.g., a burn, ask them to give the cause of the injury, e.g., hot oil or an open flame. Explain that the c ause of the injury is the workplace hazard. As the list of examples grows, point out that hazar ds fall in to different categories: Safety hazards: these are physical conditions that can cause harm, such as slippery floors, broken ladders, or high heat. Chemicals exposure: hazardous chemicals (cleaning p roducts, chemicals used in production, etc.) are common in many jobs. Biological hazards: workers may get exposed to viru ses or bacteria, blood, insects, or other biological hazards on the job. Misc. hazards: this can include things like workpla ce violence. Next, divide group up again into small groups of ma ximum 4 participants per group. You can either keep groups the same as earlier, or mix part icipants up. Tell participants they all work together at the ABC Garment Factory and that they a re meeting after work one day to talk about some of the health and safety problems they a re having on the job. Distribute: /square4 Handout #3 – drawing of the ABC Garment Factory (on e per participant) /square4 Handout #4 – the health & safety checklist Review the example provided in the checklist to exp lain how to use the chart. If people still seem uncertain, ask them to share another example o f a hazard with the group, and the effect or injury it might cause.

What kind of safety risks are th ere? What might threaten their health? Ask them to write down every possible HAZARD or UNSAFE CONDITION that they think exists in the factory. Emphasize that they should use their: /head2right EYES: imagine looking around at the factory /head2right EARS: imagine listening to the typical sounds /head2right NOSE: imagine what smells might be present Each group should choose a name for their group and a Secretary to take notes. After about 15-20 minutes, reconvene as a large group. Taking turns, have each group read out one of the hazards they identified. On butcher paper at the f ront, write up the answers. Keep going around until all groups have shared all their hazar ds. Explain that you will return to this exercise in a little while. B R E A K – 1 5 M I N U T E S

These hazards are sometimes identifiable more from the symptom than the hazard – you feel dizzy, your eyes water, your nose runs or itches, you get a headache, etc. Transition from the factory exercise by explaining that workers are often exposed to “invisible” hazards – for example, chemical or biological expos ure. Distribute Handout #5, Maria’s Nail Salon. Ask eve ryone to imagine that they work in this nail salon, six days a week, 10 hours a day. Have them study the drawing, taking note of possible hazards in the picture. Teaching trick /barb2right You can also bring a bottle of hairspray to class and spray a bit and/or a bottle of nail polish and nail polish remover tha t you simply open and leave sitting out for a few minutes. Activity: explain that participants will each have the oppor tunity to act out, without using words, how they think they would feel after working in the nail salon for a few weeks. Ask for 4-5 volunteers to come to the front of the room to act out how they feel. Have the rest of the group guess what the symptoms are. Some examples c ould be: holding your head because it hurts; rubbing your eyes; blowing your nose: acting dizzy, etc. You can act out one to get the group started. Questions: (1) What might be causing these symptoms? (2) How is this caused? (Skin contact, breathe in chem icals or fumes, drink it)

Participants will identify both short-term problems – cuts, burns, accidents – as well as long er-term health impacts of hazards. Provide each participant with a large piece of butc her paper, markers, and dot stickers in different colors. Ask them to draw the outline of their own body and label their page at the top with (1) their name and (2) their job. Ask them to take 10 minutes to put stickers on their body map indicating where they have pain, stress, or inj uries from their job. Encourage them to note both immediate pains – from cuts or burns – as well as longer-term pains – muscle aches, breathing problems, etc. If you prefer, you can ask participants to complete Handout #6 for the body mapping. Report-back : depending on the group, you can have workers repo rt-back in small groups divided by type of job or industry. If the large g roup is very diverse, in terms of types of jobs, create mixed groups and ask workers to spend 2 minu tes per person explaining their body map to the group. Large group discussion: Ask participants to share any reactions to what the y learned from the activity. Did they see any patterns? What kinds o f health impacts did participants notice most frequently? In leading the discussion, help the gr oup identify and discuss longer-term health consequences of workplace hazards, such as long-ter m respiratory problems, ergonomic issues, etc. * * 1 0 MI N U T E BR E A K * *

Explain to participants that now that they have sta rted identifying the hazards at the ABC Garment Factory and at Maria’s Nail Salon, they are going to brainstorm ways to lessen or get rid of these hazards. Explain that their goals, in order of importance should be to: REMOVE, CONTROL & PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. This means: 1) Removing the hazard . The best option is to completely get rid of the hazard altogether. For example, you could substitute non- toxic materials or replace broken equipment. But…. 2) Controlling the hazard . It is not always possible to completely remove a hazard. In that case, your next question should be: how can yo u control it? How can you minimize it? Consider both administrative and engineering controls . a. There might be physical changes – mats for slippery floors; guards on machines, that help lessen the danger. b. There might be way to train workers to work more sa fely, etc. 3) Protecting against the hazard . The last line of defense is to protect against t he hazard by providing workers with personal protectiv e equipment (“PPE”) – like gloves, masks, etc. Write (1) REMOVE, (2) CONTROL, (3) PPE on butcher p aper at the front of the room.

(4) Flag the 3-4 best solutions to a hazard that they a re proposing. Report back : each group should spend 5 minutes reporting back on the 3-4 best solutions they brainstormed as a group. GROUP DISCUSSION : Ask for commentaries from the group based on the activity. Ask them in particular to talk about what solutions workers can implement on their own, and what solutions require the employer’s involvement. As the facilit ator, you should help manage the conversation – challenge the group when solutions a re not realistic, raise other ideas that occur to you but that do not come out in the group discus sion, etc. B R E A K F O R T H E D A Y .

To start, have participants sit in a circle in a large group and going around, say their name a nd one thing that they learned or that impacted them from the first day’s activities. 9 ) WO R K E R S ’ LE G A L RI G H T S 4 5 M I N U T E S GOAL : To orient the group to their basic legal rights u nder federal and state law to work in a safe and healthy workplace. Remind participants about the activities they did a t the end of the prior day: they identified hazards, and proposed solutions. Remind participan ts that some of the most important solutions they proposed require the employer to tak e steps. Poll participants: what do you think the boss would do if you made these suggestions at work? Explain that you will now review workers’ basic leg al rights. Ask the group to share: 1) the name of the federal law that protects workers’ safety and health on the job 2) the name of the federal agency that enforces this l aw /barb2right Write up on the board or on paper “OSHA” – explain that OSHA, which is part of the Department of Labor, enforces the federal Occupatio nal Safety and Health Act, the main law that protects workers on the job. /barb2right Ask the group to guess what year the law was passe d: answer is 1970. Explain that the OSH Act applies to: 1) Basically all workers and 2) It applies to workers regardless of their immigrati on status. 5 OSHA works to: 1) develop rules about workplace safety; 2) enforce those rules through inspecting workplaces; 3) track workplace accidents; and 5 Workers typically not covered by OSHA include the self-employed; immediate family members of farm emp loyers who do not employ any outside employees; and worker s covered under another federal law (such as minewo rkers or those in the Coast Guard).

Explain that you have 5 basic rights under OSHA . Ask group to brainstorm what these rights might be – write ideas up on the board. Then revie w the 5 key rights: 1) A healthy and safe workplace; 2) Information; 3) Training; 4) To request that an unsafe workplace situation be ch anged (and to file a complaint with OSHA about it); and 5) Protection from retaliation for reporting unsafe wo rking conditions. /head2right Distribute Handout #8, workers rights under OSHA. Go back one by one to discuss them in more depth. 1) Healthy and safe workplace : a. You have the legal right to work free from known ha zards that can cause death or serious physical harm to you. This includes hav ing tools and equipment that is in good condition an regularly maintained. b. Where an unsafe condition exists, an employer must first attempt to reduce a hazard to a safe level by using engineering or admi nistrative control, for example by substituting less hazardous materials or work pr actices. c. If engineering and administrative controls cannot a dequately reduce the hazard of the working condition, then an employer must pro vide a worker personal protective equipment (PPE) at no cost to the worker . 2) Information : a. Your rights as a worker – the OSHA poster. Distrib ute copies of the poster and ask if participants have seen it posted at their jo b. b. Information on dangerous chemicals used in your job . i. Explain that employers must have Material Safety Da ta Sheets for all hazardous chemicals used. Distribute the sample MS DS for review. ii. Employers are to provide training on hazardous chem icals that can be understood by the worker (including in the worker’s primary language). c. Information on injuries or illnesses that happen at your worksite. i. If there are more than 10 workers on the job, the e mployer must keep an OSHA 300 log of all injuries and illnesses. d. Copies of your own medical records, if kept by the employer.

It does not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the U.S. Departmen t of Labor, nor does mention of trade names, commercial products, o r organizations imply endorsement by the U.S. Gover nment. 15 3) Training : your employer must train you to perform your job safely, according to the OSHA rules that apply. 4) Reporting unsafe working conditions . You can: a. Ask your employer to correct unsafe working conditi ons; b. File a complaint with OSHA anonymously about the co ndition; c. Participate in the OSHA investigation and get infor mation about the resolution. d. Workers should call OSHA immediately (1-800-321-OSH A) to report imminent dangers. To count as an “imminent” danger, there m ust be: i. A threat of death or serious physical harm (meaning such severe harm to a part of your body you will lose use or not be abl e to use it well). ii. Exposure to a health hazard (e.g., a chemical) that will shorten the worker’s life or substantially reduce the worker’s physical or mental abilities (harm does not have to happen immediately ). 5) Protection against retaliation :6 a. Your employer can’t retaliate against you for repor ting an unsafe condition or participating in an OSHA investigation. Report ins tances of retaliation to OSHA immediately, but no later than 30 days after it hap pens! QUESTION : When can a worker refuse to do unsafe work and be protected against retaliation? /square4 OSHA does not necessarily protect a worker who refu ses to do work as ordered by the employer, even if that work may be unsafe. Ref using work can result in discipline by the employer. /square4 However, if a worker reasonably believes, in good f aith, that they are being exposed to an imminent danger , the worker may refuse to perform the work as orde red. o "Good faith" means that even if an imminent danger is not found to exist, the worker had reasonable grounds to believe that i t did exist. o As noted above, “imminent dangers” are serious, imm ediate dangers that are likely to cause serious injury. /square4 While you may have a right to refuse to engage in w ork that presents an imminent danger, you do not have the right to walk off the j ob. 6 The information on retaliation is drawn nearly ver batim from OSHA’s guide, found at: www.osha.gov/dte/outreach/intro_osha/intro_to_osha_ guide.pdf .

Your right to refuse to do a task is protected if all of the following conditions are met: (1) Where possible, you have asked the employer to elim inate the danger, and the employer failed to do so; and (2) You refused to work in "good faith." This means tha t you must genuinely believe that an imminent danger exists. Your refusal cannot be a disguised attempt to harass your employer or disrupt business; and (3) A reasonable person would agree that there is a rea l danger of death or serious injury; and (4) There isn't enough time, due to the urgency of the hazard, to get it corrected through regular enforcement channels, such as reque sting an OSHA inspection. When all of these conditions are met, you should ta ke the following steps: (1) Ask your employer to correct the hazard; (2) Ask your employer for other work; (3) Tell your employer that you won't perform the work unless and until the hazard is corrected; and (4) Remain at the worksite until ordered to leave by yo ur employer. /barb2right If your employer discriminates against you for ref using to perform the dangerous work, contact OSHA immediately . When you file your complaint, you must demonstrate that: 1) You were engaged in activity protected under the Act, such as notifying your employer of an unsafe working condition; 2) Your employer knew about your protected activity ; and 3) It was because of your protected activity that t he employer took adverse action against you. Adverse action is generally defined as any action t hat would dissuade a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity. Depending upon the circumstances of the case, "adverse" action can include: • Firing or laying off • Blacklisting • Demoting • Denying overtime or promotion

Explain that each small group will have 25 minutes to prepare a skit that incorporates what they have learned from the training. Participants are f ree to choose the focus on their skit: they can revisit earlier activities/examples and use those f or the substance of the skit; they can “invent” a workplace; or they can use an example from their own lives. Emphasize that the groups will have limited time to develop their full skit, so th ey should focus on building the skit rather than spending time choosing a topic. The skits should be 8-10 minutes long. Each skit s hould: 1) Illustrate a group of workers dealing with some kin d of hazard at their job; 2) Make clear what the hazard is that is a problem; 3) Show what harm that hazard is causing; 4) Illustrate tactics the workers can use to lessen th e risk of the hazard. Give the groups 25 minutes to prepare and practice their skits. You can reconfigure groups so that there are 4 small groups who will then perform their skit to the large group. Have each group perform their skit, and give 5 minutes after the skit for group feedback.

Have participants go around in a circle and share w ith the group, in one minute or less: /barb2right One thing they learned at the training; /barb2right One thing they will do differently in their job bas ed on what they learned; and /barb2right One idea about how they can share what they have le arned with other workers. Distribute the Post-Test and ask participants to sp end 10 minutes completing it. Collect the tests. After collecting the tests, spend 5-10 minutes taki ng questions from participants. Was there anything they didn’t remember or had questions abou t, especially after taking the test? Any areas where they would like more information? Next: distribute Handout #9, the Plan of Action. E xplain to participants that they should now each spend 10 minutes on their own, thinking about what commitment they can make to sharing the information they learned with their com munity. Have participants break up in to their small groups and spend 15 minutes presenting their Plans of Action to each other. Come back as a large grou p, and ask participants to share any last thoughts or ideas with the large group. If you have prepared certificates ahead of time, di stribute certificates to participants. (If not, tell participants you will mail them their certific ate.) End with a Unity Clap. Have participants stand in a circle, and begin clapping in unison slowly. Slowly increase the speed of clapping, and as the m omentum builds, the group converges in the middle with a shout of “Sí se puede!” or “Yes we ca n!” E N D O F T R A I N I N G .

A fire breaks out in a factory in a 10-story building. There is no fire alarm in the factory, which occupies the 8 th , 9 th , and 10 th floors. Workers on the 8 th floor phone upstairs to workers on the 10 th to warn them. But there is no way to contact work ers on the 9 th floor. Workers begin to panic, desperate to escape the spr eading fire. But there is only a small elevator located in the back of the building and on e stairway. Every day, the managers lock all the other doors, exits, and the front elevator to p revent employee “theft.” The building has only one fire escape, which is poo rly built and in disrepair. It quickly gives way, causing workers to fall nearly 100 ft. The fire department arrives on the scene, but their ladders only reach the 6 th floor. They unwind their hoses, but water pressure is weak – an d the stream of water only reaches the 7 th floor. Their nets are weak, and fail to hold worke rs leaping from the burning building. The building doors open inwards, rather than out, c ausing further chaos as panicked workers try to flee. By the end of the disaster, 146 of the approximatel y 500 workers in the factory died that day. Sixty-two of those who died had jumped, fallen or w ere pushed from the top floors windows. Tragically, there had already been four fires repor ted in this factory previously. Investigations later showed the fire started when a cigarette was thrown in a waste bin that had accumulated over two months’ worth of trash. Questions for Discussion: Where in New York City do you think this took place ? What borough or neighborhood? What kind of factory do you think it was? What year do you think it happened? How many days a week and hours a day do you think t hese workers worked? Who do you think these workers were? Where were th ey from? Were the men or women? How old do you think they were? What are some of the reasons this disaster happened ?

Comienza un incendio en una fá brica localizada en un edificio de 10 pisos. No hay alarma de incendios en la fábrica, qu e ocupa el octavo, noveno y décimo piso. Los trabajadores en el octavo piso llaman por teléfono a los trabajadores del décimo piso para advertirles. Sin embargo no hay forma de contactar a los trabajadores del noveno piso. Los trabajadores entran en pánico, desesperados por escapar del incendio que se va extendiendo por toda la fábrica. Pero sólo hay un a scensor pequeño localizado en la parte de atrás del edificio y unas escaleras. Todos los días , los gerentes cerraban las demás puertas, salidas y el otro ascensor en la parte frontal al e dificio para prevenir que los empleados “robaran” mercancía. El edificio sólo tiene una escalera de incendios, q ue está mal construida y en mal estado. Rápidamente se descompone, provocando que los traba jadores caigan desde una altura de casi 100 pies. El departamento de incendios llega al lugar, pero s us escaleras sólo llegan al sexto piso. Utilizan sus mangueras, pero la presión de agua es débil, y la corriente de agua sólo llega el séptimo piso. Las redes son débiles, y no logran para atrap ar a las personas que van cayendo desde el edificio en llamas. Las puertas del edificio abren hacia adentro en vez de hacia afuera, causando aún más caos mientras los trabajadores están desesperados por sa lir. Al final de la catástrofe, 146 de los aproximadame nte 500 trabajadores en la fábrica murieron ese día. 62 de las víctimas saltaron, se cayeron o fueron empujados desde las ventanas del edificio. Trágicamente, ya habían ocurrido cuatro incendios e n esta fábrica anteriormente. Al hacer una investigación del incidente, se cree que el incendi o comenzó al echar un cigarrillo en un cubo de basura que tenía acumulada la basura de aproximadam ente 2 meses. Preguntas de discusión ¿En qué lugar de Nueva York crees que ocurrió este evento? ¿En qué barrio o vecindario? ¿Qué tipo de fábrica crees que era? ¿En qué año crees que sucedió? ¿Cuántos días a la semana y horas al día crees que estos trabajadores trabajaban? ¿Quiénes crees que eran estos trabajadores? ¿De dón de eran? ¿Eran hombres o mujeres? ¿Qué edades crees que tenían? ¿Cuáles son algunas de las razones por las cuales s ucedió este desastre?
