See Administrative Reco rd (“AR”) at 240. He remained eligible for special education under these two categories for the duration of his school career, including the time periods that are relevant for purposes of this lawsuit, namely 2003-2006. During that relevant time period, plaintiff attended Hillsdale High School as a freshman during the 2002-03 school year, and as a sophomore for part of the 2003-04 school year. AR at 242, 251. During plaintiff’s 9th grade year at Hillsdal e, in fall of 2002, defendant San Mateo Union High School District conducted plaintiff’s tr iennial review. The tr iennial review refers to the process of assessing and determining a student’s eligibility and placement needs once every three years. AR 852. As part of the 2002 triennial review, defendant conducted several assessments of plaintiff. These a ssessments included administration of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT”), a Bruckner diagnostic math test, and the Peabot Individual Achievement Test (“PIAT”). AR at 587-88. On the WRAT, plaintiff demonstrated weakness in math and spelling, and high level decoding skills. Id . at 589. On the Bruckner, plaintiff scored very well in addition and subtraction, but was weak in multiplication and division. AR at 591. Pl aintiff performed above grade level on the PIAT. Id. Plaintiff was also observed in the classr oom by an educational assistant, in order to assess how plaintiff interacted with others in the classroom environment. The educational assistant reported that plaintiff did not r equire assistance, was not easily distracted by others, and did not distract ot hers, although he at times appeared le thargic. AR at 594-95. Finally, a District psychologist reviewed plaintiff’s student records and spoke with plaintiff’s teachers. AR at 852-53. Based on this review, she determined that no further psychological testing of plaintiff was needed. Id . She sent plaintiff’s mother, XXXXXXX XXXXXX, a confirming letter. Id . Ms. XXXXXXX did not request further assessments. Id .Case 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

Following the completion of these triennial assessments, plaintiff’s Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) team convened on October 4, 2002 for the triennial review. AR 1145-63. Among others, plaintiff and his mother were present at the meeting, as well as Ms. Pam Rianda, plaintiff’s special education t eacher, and Ms. Lisa Fox, plaintiff’s speech and language therapist. AR 1148. The IEP team noted plaintiff’s areas of strength and weakness, with plaintiff’s written language and ma th skills included in the latter category. AR 1145. The team also noted that plainti ff was experiencing problems with punctuality and attendance, and was demonstrating some “defi ant behaviors” and a “level of anger that contribute[d] to [plaintiff’s] not being successf ul in school.” AR 1148, 1223-25. The IEP team recommended that plaintiff continue to be placed in a Special Day Class (“SDC”) for 3 to 4 periods a day, and in order to address plaintiff’s observed speech and language problems, it recommended that plaintiff be given 3 periods per month of direct speech and language therapy. AR 1146-48. The team also recommended that plaintiff participate in Hillsdale’s anger management program. Id . Ms. XXXXXXXX received notice of the Procedural Safeguards, indicated she understood her rights, and consented to the IEP. AR 306; 1148. On November 12, 2002, plaintiff’s IEP t eam convened again, in order to draft a Behavior Support Plan (“BSP”). AR 1243-49. Prior to the meeting, the defendant had requested consent to conduct an environmental assessment, which examines a student’s behavior, discipline and school functioning. AR 601-02; 1242. The purpose of the environmental assessment was to determine if plaintiff needed more support or services, and to determine if plaintiff needed a BSP. AR 602-03. It appears that the environmental assessment never took place. Nonethele ss, based on plaintiff’s general behavior and school performance, the IEP team developed a BSP on November 12. AR 603-05, 1249. The BSP noted that plaintiff was exhibiting “inappropriate classroom behavior” that was impeding plaintiff’s learning, and that the behavior was being caused by “anger,”Case 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

To that end, the BSP outlined certain interventions that were to be undertaken by defendant in an effort to modify plaintiff’s behavior. The interventions consisted of specific teaching strategies, positive reinforcement, one-to-one assistance when nec essary, a tutorial study period, anger management counseling, and weekly progress re ports. AR 604-05; 1170; 1249. The BSP did not, however, address any truancy issues that plaintiff was having, which had beenremarked upon earlier by the School Safety Advocate. AR 1240. Plaintiff and his mother participated in t he November 2002 IEP meeting, received the Notice of Procedural Safeguards, indicat ed she understood her rights, and consented to the IEP. AR 308; 1246. De fendant then implemented the BSP. AR 605. While plaintiff continued to receive disciplinary referrals and suspensions after the creation of the BSP, they were less frequent than the disciplinary refe rrals that plaintiff received prior to the implementation of t he BSP. AR 652; 977. Several months later, on April 8, 2003, Ms. XXXXXXX wrote to Marvin Meyers, the District’s Director of Special Education, and requested a change of placement for her son, due to plaintiff’s continuing behavior problem s and his inability to benefit in his current placement. AR 248-49; 1252. In response, an IEP team meeting was thereafter held on May 1, 2003. AR 1257-66. As the reports s ubmitted in connection with the May 2003 IEP stated, plaintiff was continuing to exhibit negative behaviors, including tardiness, defiance of authority, and use of profani ty, among other things. AR 1265. Plaintiff’s behavior was described as “totally distracting to the class and instruction.” Id . Nonetheless, based on the information discussed with plaintiff’s teacher s at the IEP team meeting, plaintiff’s mother “rescinded her request for change in plac ement,” and the May 2003 IEP resulted in no changes to the October 4, 2002 and Novem ber 12, 2002 IEPs that were already in place. AR 249; 1258; 1262. Shortly thereafter, on May 13, 2003, plainti ff was arrested for stealing beer from a San Mateo supermarket during school hours. AR 995; 1285.

On November 13, 2003, plaintiff’s IEP team once again convened, this time for plaintiff’s annual review. AR 1268-81. The IEP team noted that plaintiff’s “greatest weakness [was] his truancy.” AR 1274. The t eam further noted that it was difficult to gauge whether plaintiff’s current placement wa s effective, due to excessive absences on his part. AR 695; 974. In the area of s peech and language, plaintiff’s truancy prevented the IEP team from formally assessing pl aintiff. However, the speech and language pathologist, Ms. Fox, was also plaintiff’s tr eating therapist for the past two years, and therefore was able to review records and refl ect on her observations of plaintiff during therapy sessions, in order to identify speech and language needs, and draft accuratepresent levels of performance. AR 695; 974; 1279. Ms. Fox also recommended modifying plaintiff’s speech and language goals, and changing to consultation speech services,because of plaintiff’s frequent truancy. AR 690- 91. Specifically, Ms. Fox was concerned about the effect of pulling plaintiff out of hi s academic classes for speech, given his truancy and poor grades. By switching to speech and language services on a consultation basis,the idea was to afford plaintiff a chance to improve his attendance. Id . In the area of academics, the November 200 3 IEP team – which included plaintiff’s general education and special education teacher s – developed accurate present levels of performance based on current observations of plai ntiff in the classroom. AR 616-22; 969; The team noted that plai ntiff’s strengths included reading comprehension, vocabulary, and creative writing. Weaknesses incl uded attendance, expository writing, and mathematics. AR 743-45. The IEP team recommended placement in SDC for three periods per day. AR 968. The IEP team also found that the Nove mber 2002 BSP was no longer appropriate, as plaintiff’s primary struggle was now with tr uancy. Accordingly, the IEP team developed a new BSP at the November 2003 meeting. Th is revised BSP provided for daily planner checks, one-one-one assistance during tutorial at least twice a week, weekly progressCase 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

AR 748; 750; 975. The November 2003 BSP also required plaintiff’s s pecial education teacher to personally call plaintiff on his cell phone when he did not appear in class, or to call Ms. XXXXXXX. AR751. Plaintiff was not referred to the County Mental Health Department. Ms. XXXXXXX participated in the November 2003 IEP team m eeting, received the notice of procedural safeguards, and consented to the IEP. AR 315-16. In the first two months following impl ementation of the BSP, between November 2003 and January 2004, plaintiff’s grades improv ed. AR 752. In December 2003 and January through February 2004, however, plaint iff received suspensions for truancy from school, and for disrupting activities and defying school policies. AR 1237-38; 1250. On March 4, 2004, plaintiff’s May 2003 arrest was adjudicated by the Alameda County Juvenile Court. The court adjudged plaint iff a ward of the court and ordered plaintiff to serve 60 days in juvenile hall. AR 1000. However, as an alternative to this sentence, the court approved plaintiff’s enrollment in a wilderness program called the Rocky Mountain Academy, in Colorado – at his parent’s expens e. AR 998-99; 1287. Ultimately, Ms. XXXXXXX enrolled plaintiff in the Ascent program in Idaho, a six week wilderness intervention program. AR 281; 380; 2006. Plaintiff began the program at some point between March 18 and March 21, 2004. AR 998; 1002. On March 22, 2004, Ms. XXXXXXX informed plaintiff’s special educat ion teacher, Ms. Hahn, that plaintiff was attending the Ascent program. AR 837. S he made no request that the District fund the program. AR 325-26. Plaintiff attended Ascent from March 22, 2004 through May 5, 2004. AR 998; 1411. While there, he made progress with certain ma ladaptive behaviors. AR 384-85. Upon his completion of the program at Ascent, it wa s recommended by Ascent staff that plaintiff attend a residential CEDU High School in San Bernardino. AR 998; 1301.

AR 997; 1006; 1333. While at CEDU, plaintiff earned a 2.60 GPA. AR 1335. After the CEDU school’s closure, plaintiff was sent home while an appropriate school placement could be located. Plaintiff’s probation officer noted in her report that no pub lic or private schools met plaintiff’s needs in the surrounding area. AR 1296. Court records indicate that, after weighing the options, plaintiff and his parents concluded that the M t. Bachelor Academy in Oregon was the best placement, and that the court allowed plaintiff to be placed there at the parents’ expense. AR 1006; 1296; 1304. Plaintiff enrolled at Mt. Bachelor on May 11, 2005, where he finally graduated with a High School Diploma in June 2006. AR 1401. Wh ile at Mt. Bachelor, plaintiff earned As, Bs, and Cs, although he also continued to demonstrate behaviors such as truancy, lowgrades, refusal to participate in class, and alcohol and tobacco abuse.

The ALJ Decision The due process hearing occurred on December 18-20, 2006. See AR 228; 2106. The Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”), Suzanne Brown, considered the following issues at the hearing: Did the District deny plaintiff a FAPE from July 19, 2003 through the 2005-06 school year by failing to: (a) assess plainti ff’s behavioral needs; (b) meet plaintiff’s unique needs for behavioral and mental health services; Did the District deny plaintiff a FAPE from November 12, 2003, through the 2005-06 school year by failing to: (a) have a school psychologist attend the November 13, 2003 IEP team meeting; (b) assess plaintiff in the areas of behavior, speech and language, and academics; (c) provide adequate present leve ls of performance in the November 13, 2003 IEP in the areas of behavior, speec h and language, and academics, which deniedCase 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

ALJ Brown issued a decision on February 8, 2007. With respect to the first issue, the ALJ concluded that plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the District denied him a FAPE from July 19, 2003 through the 2005-06 school year . AR 158. Specifically, the ALJ found that the District had not failed to assess plai ntiff’s behavioral needs, and furthermore did not fail to assess plaintiff’s unique behavioral and mental health needs. Id . Similarly, on the second issue, the ALJ also found that plaintiff had failed to establish that the District denied him a FAPE from November 12, 2003 through t he 2005-06 school year, and made specific findings with respect to each of the sub-iss ues presented. AR 158-59. Finally, the ALJ found that, with respect to the last issue, plai ntiff’s mother is not entitled to reimbursement for the private school placements or rela ted transportation costs. AR 159. Plaintiff now seeks reversal of the ALJ’ s decision, reimbursement for educational expenses, and attorneys’ fees and costs. De fendant, by contrast, seeks an order affirming the findings of the ALJ in their entirety. DISCUSSION A.

Material facts are those which may affect the outcome of the case. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc ., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A dispute as to a material fact is genuine if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Id . The court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and give it the benefit of all reasonable inferences to be drawn from those facts. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp ., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986). IDEA ClaimsThe IDEA requires school districts to provide disabled children with a “free appropriate public education” (“FAPE”). 20 U. S.C. § 1412(1). The education to which access is provided must be “reasonably calculated to enable the child to receiveeducational benefits.” Bd. of Educ. of Hendr ick Hudson Central Sch. Dist. Westchester County v. Rowley , 458 U.S. 176, 207 (1982). To that end, the IDEA requires school districts to create an “individualized education program” (IEP) for each disabled child. Id . It further authorizes parents challenging their child ’s IEP to request an “impartial due process hearing.” See id . at § 1415(f). The party that has requested the hearing bears the burden of proof at the hearing. See Schaffer v. Weast , 126 S.Ct. 528, 537 (2005). A party aggrieved by the findings and decis ion made in a state administrative due process hearing has the right to bring an original civil action in a state court of competent jurisdiction or in federal district court in or der to secure review of the disputed findings and decisions. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2). The party challenging the decision bears the burden of persuasion on its claim. See Clyde K. v. Puyallup Sch. Dist. No. 3 , 35 F.3d 1396, 1399 (9th Cir. 2004). In reviewing the administr ative decision, the district court “shall receive the records of the administrative pr oceedings; shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party; and basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(B).

S ee Ojai Unified School District v. Jackson , 4 F.3d 1467, 1471 (9th Cir. 1993). However, “becaus e Congress intended states to have the primary responsibility for formulating each indivi dual child’s education, [courts] must defer to their ‘specialized knowledge and experience’ by giving ‘due weight’ to the decisions of the states’ administrative bodies.” Amanda J. Ex rel. Annette J. v. Clark County Sch. Dist ., 267 F.3d 877, 888 (9th Cir. 2001). This review requires the district court to carefully consider the administrative agency’s findings . See Susan N. v. Wilson Sch. Dist ., 70 F.3d 751, 758 (3d. Cir. 1995). “The amount of defer ence accorded the hearing officer’s findings increases where they are thorough and care ful.” Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist. v. Wartenberg , 59 F.3d 884, 891 (9th Cir. 1995). After such consideration, “the court is free to accept or reject the findings in part or in whole.” Susan N ., 70 F.3d at 758. When the court has before it all the evidence r egarding the disputed issues, it may make a final judgment in what “is not a true summary judgment proc edure [but] a bench trial based on a stipulated record.” Ojai , 4 F.3d at 1472. B. The Parties’ Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment The parties’ cross-motions raise the followi ng issues for resolution: (1) whether the ALJ properly concluded that the District did not deny plaintiff a FAPE from July 19, 2003 through the 2005-06 school year; (2) whether t he ALJ properly concluded that the District did not deny plaintiff a FAPE from Novem ber 13, 2003, through the 2005-06 school year; and (3) whether the ALJ properly conclude that Ms. XXXXXXX was not entitled to reim- bursement for private school plac ements from March 2004 to June 2006. Preliminarily, however, the cour t notes that in addition to these issues, plaintiffs raise others that defendant has correctly noted are time- barred. For example, plaintiffs argue in their papers that the November 2002 IEP that was drafted constituted denial of a FAPE,2Case 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

United States District Court For the Northern District of California1 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728 3The ALJ noted July 19, 2006 as the operat ive date of filing for statute of limitations purposes. 4A Behavior Intervention Plan is usually developed following a Functional Analysis Assessment (“FAA”) or Functional B ehavioral Assessment (“FBA”). See Cal. Code. Regs. Tit. 5, § 3001 (aa, f). 11and that a FAPE was further denied when defendant District failed to include necessary members at the November 12, 2002 and May 1, 2003 IEP meetings. See Pl. Mot. Summ. Judgm. at 22:24-23:10; 25:24-26:19. Neither party disputes, however, that plaintiff’s claims, which were administratively filed on July 20, 2006, are subject to a three year statute of limitations. See Cal. Educ. Code § 56505(l), eff. October 7, 2005 to October 8, 2006 (amended by Cal. Educ. Code § 56505(l), eff. Oc tober 9, 2006). Accordingly, plaintiff cannot assert any claims arising out of conduct occurring prior to July 20, 2003, and hisclaims relating to defendant’s denial of F APE in connection with the November 12, 2002 IEP and IEP meeting, and the May 1, 2003 IEP meeting, are barred. 3 Moreover, because the ALJ did not have occasion to pass upon these claims, they are furthermore barredbecause plaintiff failed to exhaust all administr ative remedies in connection with the claims. The court now turns to the substantive issues before it. 1. Whether the District denied plaintiff a FAPE from July 19, 2003 through the 2005-06 school year Plaintiff contends that the District denied him a FAPE for the above-referenced period when it (a) failed to properly assess hi s behavioral needs; and (b) failed to meet his behavioral needs. With respect to the former, plaintiff argues that the District failed to conduct an environmental assessment in c onnection with the November 12, 2002 IEP meeting, leading to an ineffective BSP that fail ed to meet plaintiff’s needs, and furthermore, that the District failed to offer a Behavior Intervention Plan.4 See Pl. Mot. Summ. Judgment at 21-23. With respect to the latter, plaintiff argues that the District failed to meet his unique behavioral needs when it failed to refer plaintiff for County Mental Health Services, despiteCase 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

See id . at 25; see also Pl. Opp. to Summ. Judgm. at 8-10. For the reasons that follow, however, the court finds that plainti ff’s arguments are without merit. a. District’s failure to assess plaintiff’s behavioral needs The issue before the court is whether t he District failed to conduct an environmental assessment and a FAA or FBA leading to a Behavior Intervention Plan, and if so, whethersuch failure constituted a denial of a FAPE. In the underlying administrative decision, the ALJ found that it was unclear whether the District conducted an environmental assessment in November 2002, as witness testimony on the matter was not conclusive. However, the ALJ found that the team member s present at the November 2002 IEP did identify plaintiff’s behavior problems and adopted a BSP to deal wit h those problems, which BSP actually resulted in a decrease in frequency of those behav ior problems. AR 149. As for whether defendant District was obligated to provide a F AA or FBA, the ALJ found that plaintiff’s behavior, as noted in the IEP meeting notes , did not constitute a “serious behavior problem” requiring an FAA, which would have resulted in a Behavior Intervention Plan. While acknowledging that plaintiff’s truancy problem did become a behavior problem in fall of 2003, the ALJ concluded that this was deal t with by defendant District in the November 2003 IEP and BSP. Id . Plaintiff has not pointed to any evidentiary dispute that demonstrates error on the ALJ’s part. First, even assuming that the Dis trict failed to undertake an environmental assessment before the November 2002 BSP wa s developed and implemented, this failure did not constitute a denial of a FAPE. Procedural violations – such as the failure to conduct the environmental assessment – only constitute a denial of a FAPE if the violation caused a loss of educational opportunity to the student or significantly infringed on the parents’ right to participate in the IEP process. See, e.g., R.B., ex rel. F.B.v. Napa Valley Unified School Dist., 496 F.3d 932, 938 (9th Cir. 2007).

And, as the ALJ found, the BSP actually succeeded in decreasing plaintiff’s disruptive behaviors by the beginning of the 2003-04 school year. AR 652; 977. Moreover, pl aintiff and his mother were present at the November 2002 IEP team meeting at which t he BSP was developed. Plaintiff’s mother did not object, and even consented to the November 2002 IEP and BSP. AR 306. Accordingly, even if the District fail ed to conduct an environmental assessment in connection with the November 2002 IEP, this did not rise to the level of a denial of a FAPE. Plaintiff asserts that his behavior – spec ifically, plaintiff’s truant behaviors – nonetheless deteriorated following the November 2002 IEP, such that plaintiff’s truancy became the target behavior by the time t he November 13, 2003 IEP was prepared and conducted. Yet the District continued in its failu re to conduct proper assessments, resulting in an ineffective November 2003 BSP that failed to properly address plaintiff’s truancy, and therefore also denied plaintiff a FAPE. While plaintiff contends that his truant behaviors were ignored, the testimony of certain Nove mber 2003 IEP team members was that the November 2003 BSP was developed with the express purpose of targeting plaintiff’s truant behaviors, and that this focus had shifted from the prior BSP entered in November 2002. AR 748. The November 2003 IEP also expressl y noted that plaintiff’s “greatest weakness” was truancy, and set forth increased attendance as a goal and objective. AR 966, 969,971. To that end, the revised BSP that was developed at the November 2003 IEP team meeting set forth several proposed adjustments in plaintiff’s educational services in order to address the truancy issues. Specifically, the revised BSP required daily planner checks,one on one assistance, referral to a truancy pr obation officer, and phone calls to plaintiff from plaintiff’s teacher and mother when he was not in attendance at school. AR 748-51; According to testimony given at the hear ing, implementation of this revised BSP did, in fact, help improve plaintiff’s attendance after it was implemented. AR 752. Thus, not only was the BSP adopted in November 2003 tailor ed to meet plaintiff’s unique behavioral needs in the area of truancy – the primary tar get behavior identified at the time – but theCase 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

Accord ingly, there is no evidence that a failure to properly assess plaintiff’s needs in c onnection with the November 2003 IEP and subsequent BSP resulted in a loss of educational oppor tunity for plaintiff, or the denial of a FAPE. Finally, with respect to plaintiff’s content ion that the District’s wrongfully failed to conduct an FAA or FBA and to implement a B ehavior Intervention Plan, the ALJ properly concluded that no FAA or FBA – and theref ore no Behavior Intervention Plan – was necessary. California law requires that a FAA be undertaken whenever a student develops a “serious behavior problem,” which is defi ned as a student’s actions exhibiting self- injurious, or assaultive tendencies, or a student’s actions in causing serious property damage or other pervasive and maladaptive tendencies. See Cal Code Regs., tit. 5 § Plaintiff, however, has not pointed to any affirmative evidence in the record that demonstrates, prior to November 2002, either plaintiff’s self-injurious or assaultive tendencies, or plaintiff’s actions causing se rious property damage, or defendant District’s knowledge of such. Accordingly, there is no evidence that supports the existence of a “serious behavior problem” that would hav e warranted a FAA, FBA, or Behavior Intervention Plan. b. District’s failure to meet plaintiff’s behavioral needs Plaintiff also asserts that the District deni ed him a FAPE by refusing to refer him for County Mental Health Services. The ALJ found that no referral to Mental Health Services was necessary. AR 149-51. This was bas ed on the finding that the only significant, frequent behavior preventing plaintiff from benef itting from his education – and possibly triggering a mental health referral – was truan cy. AR 149. Yet the ALJ found that the District attempted to address the truancy behavior through the November 2003 revisedBSP, which in part referred plaintiff to a truancy officer. AR 150. This, combined with the testimony of plaintiff’s teachers stating that they did not think plaintiff exhibited a need for mental health services, led the ALJ to conclude t hat the District’s failure to refer plaintiff didCase 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

AR 151. Accordingly, their testimony was speculative. 15not constitute a denial of FAPE.5 AR 151. In general, the ALJ correctly noted that a local educational agency (“LEA”) such as defendant District may refer a student for comm unity mental health services when the student has emotional or behavioral characteri stics that: (1) are observed by qualified educational staff in educational and other settings, as appropriate; (2) impede the pupilfrom benefitting from educational services; (3) ar e significant, as indicated by their rate of occurrence and intensity; (4) are associat ed with a condition that cannot be described solely as a social maladjustment as demonstrated by deliber ate noncompliance with accepted social rules, a demonstrated abilit y to control unacceptable behavior and the absence of a treatable mental disorder; and (5 ) are associated with a condition that cannot be described solely as a temporary adjustment problem that can be resolved with less than three months of school counseling. See AR 157; see also Cal. Gov’t Code § 7576 (b)(3). The LEA must also first have provided appropriate services, however, such as counselingor behavioral intervention, and the IEP team mu st have determined that the services do not meet the student’s individual needs. See id . at § 7576 (b)(5). Here, plaintiff does not actually identify the emotional or behavioral characteristic that he contends warranted a referral to mental health service. Plaintiff states only that the District should have made such a referral “based on [plaintiff’s] behavior and the District’sown failed BSPs of November 2002 and Novem ber 2003,” and that plaintiff “failed his classes, became a habitual truant and had numerous referrals for discipline.” See Pl. Opp. to Summ. Judgm. at 9. Even assuming, however, that truancy, failed classes, and discipline referrals constituted qualifying em otional and/or behavioral characteristics as outlined above, it has not been dem onstrated that the District attempted to provide services that were unable to meet plaintiff’s indi vidual needs. Indeed, as discussed above, theCase 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

United States District Court For the Northern District of California1 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728 6Defendants point out in their motion for su mmary judgment that the ALJ’s opinion sometimes states that the No vember 13, 2003 IEP meeting o ccurred on November 12, 2003. This appears to be a confusion wit h the November 12, 2002 IEP me eting. Accordingly, all references herein are to the November 13, 2003 IEP meeting, not withstanding the ALJ’s statement to the contrary. 16evidence demonstrates the opposite – i.e., that the November 2002 and November 2003 BSPs actually did succeed in improving the maladaptive behaviors that were noted in plaintiff’s respective IEPs. Furthermore, a Behavior Intervention Plan was not mandated, based on the record presently before the court. In sum, the ALJ’s finding that no referral to County Mental Health Services was required, is supported by the record. See also AR 150-51; 375-394; 530-32; 553-54; 750- 52; 760-63; 965-975; 989. The court therefore affirms the ALJ’s findings and conclusions with respect to the first issue before the court – i.e., whether t he District denied plaintiff a FAPE from July 19, 2003 through the 2005-06 school year, by failing to properly assess and/or meet plaintiff’s behavioral needs. Defendant’s motion for summary judgment as to this issue isaccordingly GRANTED, and plaintiffs’ cro ss-motion for summary judgment on the same issue is DENIED. Whether the District denied plaintiff a FAPE from November 13, 2003 through the 2005-06 school year6 Plaintiff contends that the District denied him a FAPE for the above-referenced period for several reasons. Each issue considered by the ALJ, is addressed in turn. a. failure to have a school psychologist attend the November 13, 2003 IEP team meeting The November 2003 IEP meeting consis ted of: general education teacher Ms. Rianda, special education teacher Ms. Hahn, speech and language pathologist Ms. Fox, plaintiff, and plaintiff’s mother.

Plaintiff, however, contends that the District violated procedure and denied plaintiff a FAPE, because it did not have a school psychologist attend the meeting.Case 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

United States District Court For the Northern District of California1 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728 17The federal IDEA and the California Educati on Code require that IEP team meetings include: parents, at least one regular educati on teacher, at least one special education teacher, a representative of t he public agency who is qualified to provide or supervise the provision of instruction designed to meet the needs of children with disabilities, an individual who can interpret the implications of evaluat ion results, and the child if appropriate. The last individual may already be a member of the team. See 34 C.F.R. § 300.344(a)(1999); Cal. Educ. Code § 5634. The ALJ noted that California law provides that where a student is suspected of having a learning disability, at least one mem ber of the team shall be qualified to conduct individual diagnostic examinations of childr en, such as a school psychologist, speech- language pathologist, or remedial reading teac her. The Code of Federal Regulations further clarifies that a school psychologist’s attendance is required only when determining eligibility under the learning disab ility category. Accordingly, since plaintiff here had already had his eligibility under the law determined, t he ALJ concluded that no school psychologist was required to attend the November 2002 IEP meeting. Furthermore, the ALJ noted that in addition to the attendance of speech and language pathologist Ms. Fox at the November 2002 IEP meeting, Ms. Rianda and Ms. Hahn both gav e testimony at the hearing that their education and training included training in dra fting BSPs. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that while helpful, a school psychologist was not required by either state or federal law. Not only are the ALJ’s observations with respect to the law thorough and accurate, but plaintiff has not introduced any law or evi dence here that contradicts these conclusions. Accordingly, the court concludes that the ALJ was correct in deciding that the District did not deny plaintiff a FAPE by not having a school psychologist attend the November 2003IEP meeting. b. failure to assess plaintiff in the areas of behavior, speech and language, and academics The ALJ concluded that the District did not deny plaintiff a FAPE by failing to assessCase 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

United States District Court For the Northern District of California1 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728 7Plaintiff does contend that the District fa iled to offer plaintiff direct speech language therapy when it switched to consultation services as part of the November 2003 IEP. However, this is more properly construed as an argument that defend ant failed to provide proper services, rather than an argument relating to defendant’s failure to assess plaintiff, and is addressed below, in connection with defendant’s pur ported failure to meet plaintiff’s unique speech and language needs. 18plaintiff in the areas of behavior, speech and language, and academics. With respect to behavior, and as mentioned above, the ALJ concl uded that the District assessed plaintiff’s behavioral needs when it modified plaintiff’s BSP in November 2003. With respect to speech and language, as well as academics, the ALJ concluded that the District wasrequired by law to assess plaintiff in all areas related to his disability at least once every three years, unless the parent and the school agree in writing that a reassessment is unnecessary. AR 152. And since the District c onducted its triennial assessment of plaintiff in fall 2002 with three diagnostic tests – the WRAT, Bruckner math test, and the PIAT –there was no need to reassess plaintiff between fall of 2002 and March of 2004, when plaintiff left Hillsdale. AR 152, 587. Fu rthermore, the ALJ noted that plaintiff had introduced no evidence warranting reassessment in November 2003, nor did the record reflect that plaintiff’s mother had requested reassessment. AR 152. As is repeatedly the case in the motion paper s, plaintiff has failed to present any evidence that presents a dispute of fact on the re levant issues. Plaintiff mentions almost no evidence 7 relating to the District’s purported failure to assess plaintiff academically, and as for the District’s speech and language assessment, plaintiff also fails to point to any evidence that would indicate a failure to asse ss plaintiff as required by law. Moreover, plaintiff’s mother never requested reassessm ent as to the District’s speech and language assessments. AR 316. In sum, there is no dispute present that calls into question the ALJ’s conclusion that the district properly assessed plaintiff’s behavioral, academic, and speech and language needs from July 19, 2003 through the 2005-06 school year. c. failure to provide adequate present levels of performance in theCase 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

As defendants acknowledge, t he IDEA requires that a student’s annual IEP contain a statement of the student’s present levels of academic achievement and performance, including the manner in which t he student’s disability affects his or her involvement and progress in the gener al education curriculum. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i); Cal. Educ. Code § 56345(a)(1)(A). The ALJ noted that the November 2003 IEP contained limited information about plaintiff’s present levels of performance. While it listed some information, such as plaintiff’s strengths and preferences, his scores on some te sting, and his areas of need, the IEP did not contain specific information regarding ac ademic assessments, or regarding the goals and objectives for plaintiff. AR 152. This was because of plaintiff’s excessive truancy. The IEP states: “current testing has not been performed due to excessive absences...”. Id .; see also AR 969. Nor did the November 2003 IEP contain any “baseline” data from which plaintiff’s student performance may be assessed. AR 152. The ALJ found, however, that because plaintiff’s teachers and speech therapist established that they were familiar with plaintiff’s needs from working with him in the past and seeing him occasionally in fall 2003, they were able to make knowledgeable recommend ations about plaintiff’s IEP program. Id . Now, plaintiff contends that the AL J’s conclusion was error, because the District’s failure to assess his present academic levels made it (a) impossible to determine if the goals proposed adequately addressed plaintiff’s academic needs, and (b) made it impossible for Ms. XXXXXXX to determine if t he District’s offered program met plaintiff’s needs. These arguments fail to persuade. As to t he former, while true that the November 2003 IEP expressly stated that current test ing could not be performed due to “excessiveCase 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

AR 1274. The IEP also states that until plaintiff “attends school regul arly, the current placement will continue to be the least restrictive and most appropriate environment for [plaintiff.]” Id . Moreover, the IEP that was left in place was designed, as the ALJ found, by teachers with knowledge of plaintiff’s needs and past performance, and t he BSP that was newly revised at the November 2003 IEP meeting was specifically done with the purpose of aiding the truancy problems so that plaintiff could get back on tr ack academically. Therefore, even though the District was admittedly unable to assess plai ntiff’s present levels of performance thoroughly, the District was still able to ma ke knowledgeable recommendations regarding plaintiff’s proposed IEP, and to recommend a BSP that would target plaintiff’s truancy and allow him to benefit from his education. As for plaintiff’s argument that the lack of present levels of performance made it impossible for Ms. XXXXXXX to partici pate and determine whether the District’s educational offerings met plaintiff’s needs, plaint iff does not dispute that Ms. XXXXXXX was present at the November 2003 IEP team meeting, or that Ms. XXXXXXX subsequently consented to the November 2003 IEP without rais ing any objections, either at the meeting or afterwards. AR 315-16. Nor does plaintiff s ubmit any legal authority that suggests that a parent’s lack of meaningful participation in the IEP process occurs under factual circumstances similar to the case at bar. In sum, to the extent that the District fa iled to include present levels of performance in connection with the November 13, 2003 IEP, it did not constitute a denial of a FAPE. d. failure to include adequate goals in the November 13, 2003 IEP in the areas of behavior, speech and language, academics, and mental health This issue is related to the preceding issue. Plaintiff contends that, since the DistrictCase 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

United States District Court For the Northern District of California1 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728 21failed to ascertain plaintiff’s present levels of performance in connection with the November 2003 IEP, then the District also failed to prov ide adequate goals, as required by IDEA. See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(II); Cal. Educ. C ode § 56345(a)(2). For the following reasons, plaintiff is incorrect. First, as discussed above, the District’s failure to include present levels of performance did not constitute a denial of FAPE. Accordingly, plaintiff’s argument that the same led to a failure to provide adequate goals, fails. Second, the evidence demonstrates that the November 2003 IEP did include goals that were adequately tailored to plaintiff’s needs. Specifically, the IEP included a st atement of goals related to academic performance (through improved attendance), lit eracy skills (through the writing of expository essays), in math skills (through completion of math homework), and mental health skills (BSP stated goal of “cooperative and positive attendance”). AR 966-67; 976. Plaintiff, moreover, does not dispute that these goals were included. Accordingly, the ALJ’s conclusion that t he District’s purported failure to include adequate goals in the November 13, 2003 IEP in the areas of behavior, speech and language, academics, and mental health did not constitute a denial of a FAPE, is well- founded. The court hereby affirms the ALJ’s decision in this regard. e. failure to meet plaintiff’s unique speech and language needs in the areas of dysfluency, and expressive receptive and pragmatic languageskills Finally, plaintiff contends that the District denied him a FAPE when it failed to meet his unique speech and language needs, and expressive receptive and pragmatic languageskills. Specifically, plaintiff asserts that the Dis trict failed to do so when it adjusted plaintiff’s direct speech therapy to a consultation based service as part of the November 2003 IEP. Plaintiff was receiving direct speech l anguage therapy until the No vember 2003 IEP. At the November 2003 IEP, plaintiff’s teac hers determined that the best therapy would be via consultation services. This was in part bec ause of plaintiff’s truancy.

She wanted speech “to be the place [plaintiff] comes to ... towork on goals.” AR 691. Furthermore, plainti ff was missing so many classes that he was failing, and it would be “counterproductive” from “an educational point of view,” to have plaintiff show up on the rare occasion, only to have to pull him out of general education classes for speech therapy. To that end, t he recommendation was made to switch plaintiff to consultation services, to “hopefully give the behavior plan a chance to work, get himback into school more regularly so that [the speech-language therapist] could re-engagewith him in a productive way.” AR 690. Otherwis e, plaintiff’s therapist continued, “it was a totally unproductive, unworkable therapeutic plan.” Id . The ALJ found that plaintiff’s speech and language therapist, who testified to the above, was a “credible and persuasive witness,” and that her testimony established the fact that direct speech therapy “no longer facilitat ed [plaintiff’s] overall educational needs.” AR Furthermore, because plaintiff had already benefitted from years of speech therapy, the pause in direct therapy sessions would only minimally impact plaintiff’s ability to improve his speech fluency. Finally, the ALJ found that plaintiff had presented no contrary evidence on the issue. Here, plaintiff argues only that the Distric t’s decision to switch to consultation services was akin to “giving up” on its student – precisely what Congress sought to prevent when it enacted the IDEA. However, plaintiff offers no authority or contrary evidence in support of this argument. Indeed, the only evi dence in the record – Ms. Fox’s testimony – established that the District was not giving up on plaintiff, and that it was attempting everything possible to ensure plaintiff’s cont inued improvement. In sum, plaintiff has not presented evidence that warrants reversal of the ALJ’s holding on this issue. In conclusion, and with respect to the se cond issue presented before the ALJ – i.e., whether the District denied plaintiff a FAPE fr om November 13, 2003 through the 2005-06Case 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

Whether Ms. XXXXXXX was entitl ed to reimbursement for private school placements from March 2004 to June 2006 Having concluded that the ALJ’s decision is to be affirmed, the court also concludes that Ms. XXXXXXX was not entitled to reim bursement for private school placements from March 2004 to June 2006. For without proof that plaintiff was denied a FAPE, no reimbursement for such denial is appropria te. See Burlington v. Dep’t of Educ ., 471 U.S. 359, 374 (1985)(“If the courts ultimately det ermine that the IEP proposed by the school officials was appropriate, the parents would be barred from obtaining reimbursement for any interim period in which their child’s placement violated § 1415(e)(3)”). Moreover, as the ALJ noted, for the entire length of plaintiff’s attendance at private schools, Ms. XXXXXXX failed to notify the Distric t of any intent to seek reimbursement. AR The IDEA provides that reimbursement may be denied or reduced if the parents do not give the school district notice of their int ent to remove a child from public school before they do so. See, e.g. , 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I). Generally, parents must provide such notice at the most recent IEP meeting t hat the parents attended prior to the removal of the child from the public school, or by writt en notice ten business days prior to the removal of the child from public school. Id . Here, plaintiff was arrested in May 2003. AR 995. Several months later, the November 2003 IEP meeting took place. Ar ound that time (in November or December 2003), plaintiff’s private therapist first recommended that plaintiff attend the Rocky Mountain Academy as an alternative to Hillsdale. AR 345-46. Yet there is no evidence that plaintiff or his mother informed the District of ei ther plaintiff’s arrest or the private therapist’s recommended education placement, at the November 2003 IEP team meeting, or thereafter. Subsequent to 2003, plaintiff appeared in court in January 2004, at which appearance the court stated that plaintiff c ould go to Rocky Mountain Academy, which isCase 3:07-cv-02360-PJH Document 36 Filed 07/03/2008 of 24

Two mont hs later, in March 2004, plaintiff was adjudged a ward of the court. AR 996. Still, throughout all this time, there is no evidence that plaintiff or his mother informed the Distric t of the potential private placement. In fact, Ms. XXXXXXX did not contact the District to info rm them of plaintiff’s private placement until March 22, 2004, after plaintiff had been adjudged a ward of the court and after plaintiff had already left for private placement at Ascent [plaintiff went to Ascent instead of Rocky Mountain Academy]. AR 837, 998, 1002. Ev en then, Ms. XXXXXXX never requested reimbursement from the District. The first ti me the District learned of the request for reimbursement was when she filed the due process complaint in the underlying administrative action. On balance, these facts demonstrate a co mplete failure to provide adequate notice to the District of plaintiff’s private placemen t. Accordingly, even if a denial of a FAPE had been demonstrated, no reimbursement would be appropriate. For all the foregoing reasons, therefore, the court also affirms the ALJ’s decision that reimbursement is not warranted. Defendant’s motion for summary j udgment on this ground is GRANTED. The court DENIES plaintiffs’ cross-motion with respect to the reimbursement issue. C. Conclusion The ALJ’s decision is thorough, organized, and detailed, warranting a higher level of deference. To that end, the decision is affi rmed in all respects. Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, and plainti ffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
