3 ASCAC11/2014 - Bland CORAL System Our Science requires that we continue to advance OLCF’s computational capability over the next decade on the roadmap to Exascale. Since clock- rate scaling ended in 2003, HPC performance has been achieved through increased parallelism. Jaguar scaled to 300,000 cores. Titan and beyond deliver hierarchical parallelism with very powerful nodes. MPI plus thread level parallelism through OpenACC or OpenMP plus vectors Jaguar: 2.3 PF Multi- core CPU 7 MW Titan: 27 PF Hybrid GPU/CPU 9 MW 2010 2012 2017 2022 OLCF5: 5- 10x Summit ~20 MW Summit: 5 -10x Titan Hybrid GPU/CPU 10 MW

5 ASCAC11/2014 - Bland Scientific Progress at all Scales Fusion Energy A Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory team led by C.S. Chang was able to simulate and explain nonlinear coherent turbulence structures on the plasma edge in a fusion reactor by exploiting increased performance of the Titan architecture. Turbomachinery Ramgen Power Systems is using the Titan system to significantly reduce time to solution in the optimization of novel designs based on aerospace shock wave compression technology for gas compression systems, such as carbon dioxide compressors. Nuclear Reactors Center for the Advanced Simulation of Lightwater Reactors (CASL ) investigators successfully performed full core physics power -up simulations of the Westinghouse AP1000 pressurized water reactor core using their Virtual Environment for Reactor Application code that has been designed on Titan architecture. Liquid Crystal Film Stability ORNL Postdoctoral fellow Trung Nguyen ran unprecedented large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on Titan to model the beginnings of ruptures in thin films wetting a solid substrate. Earthquake Hazard Assessment To better prepare California for large seismic events SCEC joint researchers have simulated earthquakes at high frequencies allowing structural engineers to conduct realistic physics-based probabilistic seismic hazard analyses. Climate Science Simulations on OLCF resources recreated the evolution of the climate state during the first half of the last deglaciation period allowing scientists to explain the mechanisms that triggered the last period of Southern Hemisphere warning and deglaciation.

6 ASCAC11/2014 - Bland Two Architecture Paths for Today and Future Leadership Systems Hybrid Multi -Core (like Titan) •CPU / GPU hybrid systems •Likely to have multiple CPUs and GPUs per node •Small number of very powerful nodes •Expect data movement issues to be much easier than previous systems – coherent shared memory within a node •Multiple levels of memory – on package, DDR, and non- volatile Many Core (like Sequoia/Mira) •10’s of thousands of nodes with millions of cores •Homogeneous cores •Multiple levels of memory – on package, DDR, and non- volatile •Unlike prior generations, future products are likely to be self hosted Power concerns for large supercomputers are driving the largest systems to either Hybrid or Many -core architectures
