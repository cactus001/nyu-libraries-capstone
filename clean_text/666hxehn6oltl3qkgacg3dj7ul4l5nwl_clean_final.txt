Thisfiling may be viewed on the web athttp://www.ferc.gov using the ‘‘RIMS ’’ link, select ‘‘Docket # ’’ from the RIMS Menu and follow the instructions (call(202) 208 –2222 for assistance). Texas Gas states that it has entered into an agreement with ATP wherebyTexas Gas will, upon Commission approval, transfer by sale to ATP certainsupply lateral facilities consisting ofapproximately 4.436 miles of 12-inchdiameter pipeline, measurementfacilities, and various valves andequipment, located in West CameronArea Block 237 and terminating in WestCameron Area Block 250, offshoreLouisiana. Texas Gas indicates that the proposed abandonment will permit Texas Gas todivest itself of a supply lateral, which isremote from, and not integrated with, itsmainline transmission system, andwhich was constructed to support itsformer merchant function. Texas Gasavers that it no longer requires thesubject supply lateral to access gassupplies, and that these facilities are notintegral to Texas Gas ’ current role as an open-access transporter. Texas Gasasserts that abandonment of the subjectfacilities will enable Texas Gas tostreamline its transmission operationsby eliminating certain operating costsassociated with maintaining facilities that are not part of Texas Gas ’ contiguous system. Texas Gas states that the transfer of the subject supply lateral facilities willnot adversely affect any of their currentcustomers. Texas Gas declares that thereare no firm transportation commitmentsinvolving utilization of those facilities.Texas Gas avers that after the transfer,ATP indicates that it will provide non-jurisdictional service on a non-discriminatory basis. Texas Gas assertsthat availability of service through thesefacilities will not be impaired as a resultof Texas Gas ’ transfer of these facilities to ATP. Texas Gas states that ATP will pay Texas Gas the sum of $100 for TexasGas’ interest (100%) in the facilities. Texas Gas indicates that in recognitionof the costs associated with any futureretirement of these facilities by ATP, anagreement provides for Texas Gas to payATP actual and reasonable costsassociated with retirement up to$100,000. Any questions regarding this application should be directed to DavidN. Roberts, Manager of Certificates andTariffs, Texas Gas TransmissionCorporation, P.O. Box 20008,Owensboro, Kentucky 42304, at (270)688–6712. There are two ways to become involved in the Commission ’s review of this project.

A party must submit 14 copiesof filings made with the Commissionand must mail a copy to the applicantand to every other party in theproceeding. Only parties to theproceeding can ask for court review ofCommission orders in the proceeding. However, a person does not have to intervene in order to have commentsconsidered. The second way toparticipate is by filing with theSecretary of the Commission, as soon aspossible, an original and two copies ofcomments in support of or in oppositionto this project. The Commission willconsider these comments indetermining the appropriate action to be taken, but the filing of a comment alonewill not serve to make the filer a partyto the proceeding. The Commission ’s rules require that persons filingcomments in opposition to the projectprovide copies of their protests only tothe party or parties directly involved inthe protest. Persons who wish to comment only on the environmental review of thisproject should submit an original andtwo copies of their comments to theSecretary of the Commission.Environmental commenters will beplaced on the Commission ’s environmental mailing list, will receivecopies of the environmental documents,and will be notified of meetingsassociated with the Commission ’s environmental review process.Environmental commenters will not berequired to serve copies of fileddocuments on all other parties.However, the non-party commenterswill not receive copies of all documentsfiled by other parties or issued by theCommission (except for the mailing ofenvironmental documents issued by theCommission) and will not have the rightto seek court review of theCommission ’s final order. The Commission may issue a preliminary determination on non-environmental issues prior to thecompletion of its review of theenvironmental aspects of the project.This preliminary determinationtypically considers such issues as theneed for the project and its economiceffect on existing customers of theapplicant, on other pipelines in the area,and on landowners and communities.For example, the Commission considersthe extent to which the applicant mayneed to exercise eminent domain toobtain rights-of-way for the proposedproject and balances that against thenon-environmental benefits to beprovided by the project. Therefore, if aperson has comments on communityand landowner impacts from thisproposal, it is important either to filecomments or to intervene as early in theprocess as possible. Comments, protests and interventions may be filed electronically via theInternet in lieu of paper. See, 18 CFR385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructionson the Commission ’s web site under the ‘‘e-Filing ’’ link.
