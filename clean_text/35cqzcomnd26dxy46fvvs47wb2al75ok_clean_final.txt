- 1 - UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA INDIANAPOLIS DIVISION VICTOR GEORGE , Plaintiff , vs. JUNIOR ACHIEVEMENT OF CENTRAL INDIANA , INC., et al. , Defendants. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) 1:10-cv-0220-JMS-MJD ORDER ON MR. GEORGE’S MOTION TO STAY Presently pending before the C ourt is Plaintiff Victor Geor ge’s Motion to Stay Consid- eration, [dkt. 173], of Defendant Junior Achi evement of Central Indiana, Inc.’s (“JA ”) Bill of Costs, [dkt. 167], and Motion for Attorney’s Fees , [dkt. 169]. For the following reasons, the Court grants Mr. George’s reque st for a stay on the Court’s consideration of both motions. On September 28, 2011, the Court entered par tial summary judgment in favor of JA on Mr. George’s ERISA claim and di smissed Mr. George’s remaining state law claims without pre- judice. [Dkt. 159.] Mr. George filed a no tice of appeal on October 7, 2011, [dkt. 161], and represents that his appella nt’s brief is due later th is month, [dkt. 173 at 4]. On October 12, 2011, JA filed a Bill of Costs, [dkt. 167], and a Mo tion for Attorney’s Fees, [dkt. 169]. The following day, Mr. George filed a Motion to Stay the Court’s Considera- tion of both motions. [Dkt. 173.] Mr. George contests both motions but argues that in the inter- ests of judicial economy and to avoid piecemeal lit igation, the Court should stay consideration of the motions pending the outcome of his appeal. JA does not contest the stay re quest on its Motion for Attorney’s Fees. [Dkt. 175 at 1.] JA does, however, object to the Court staying a ruli ng on the Bill of Costs. JA argues that there

[Dkt. 175 at 2- ] Costs are appealable separately from the mer its, and a district cour t may award costs even while a substantive appeal is pending. Barton v. Zimmer, Inc. , 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59936, *2 (N.D. Ind. 2010). The Court has di scretion, however, to stay ruling on a bill of co sts until after the merits appeal is decided. Id. at *3. Piecemeal appeals are disf avored in the federal system. Continental Cas. Co. v. Anderson Excavating & Wrecking Co. , 189 F.3d 512, 518 (7th Cir. 1999). If the Court grants the stay request on the mo tion for attorney’s fees (which the parties agree it should do) but denies the stay request fo r the bill of costs, it is possible that two more appeals could result in addition to the appeal of the Court’s partial summa ry judgment order that is already underway. And if the Court denies Mr . George’s motion to stay, the parties will have to brief the issues surrounding the fee petition an d the bill of costs before the Court can rule on the merits of those requests. Because Mr. George’s appellant’s brief in the pending appeal is due later this month, [dkt. 173 at 4], there is not e nough time for the parties to brief the merits of the pending motions and the Court to rule on the same before Mr. George’s a ppellate deadline. Ei- ther way, disfavored piecemeal litigation could result. Moreover, as Mr. George points out, the issue he raises in th e pending appeal is an issue of first impression in the Seventh Circuit, and there is a 3-2 split of authority between the federal circuits that have addressed the i ssue. In addition to suggesting th at Mr. George’s position in this litigation may have been substa ntially justifie d, the outcome of the novel issue on appeal may eliminate any entitlement JA has to costs and fees and moot JA’s pending motions.

- 3 - Finally, Mr. George contends that discovery will be necessary to determine the reasona- bleness of JA’s requests. [Dkt. 173 at 4.] JA do es not dispute this conten tion. It is inefficient for the parties to engage in discovery and the Cour t to rule on issues that may ultimately be moot after the Seventh Circuit decide s Mr. George’s pending appeal. For the reasons stated herein, the Court GRANTS Mr. George’s Motion to Stay. [Dkt. ] The Court’s consideration of JA’s Bill of Costs, [dkt. 167], and Motion for Attorney’s Fees, [dkt. 169], will be stayed until Mr. George ’s appeal from the C ourt’s partial summary judgment order is final.
