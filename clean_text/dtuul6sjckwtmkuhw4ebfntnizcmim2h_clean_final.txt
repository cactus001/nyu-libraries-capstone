I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s Statem ent of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Phlx proposes to adopt the proposed fees described below for the trading of equity securities on the Exchange in connection with its ne w equity system (“XLE”).6 With XLE, the Exchange no longer operates a physical trading fl oor for equity securities or the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Autom ated Communicat ion and Execution (“PACE”) system .7 Therefore, the Exchange proposes to ad opt a new fee schedule to accomm odate th e trad ing of equity securities on XLE and to am end Appendix A of the Exchange ’s fee sch edule to ado pt XLE-rela ted fees, delete obsolete fees, and modify other fees that will no longer apply to eq uity trading.8 The text of the proposed rule change is av ailable on the P hlx’s W eb site at http://www.phlx.com , at the Phlx’s Office of the Secretary, and at the Comm ission’s Public Reference Room .9 II. Self-Regulatory Organ ization’s Statemen t of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, Phlx incl uded statem ents concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and di scussed any comments it re ceived on the proposal. The text of these statem ents m ay be exam ined at the places sp ecified in Item IV below. Phlx has 6 XLE is designed to pr ovide the opport unity for entire ly autom ated executions to occur within a central matching s ystem accessible by Exchange me mbers and me mber organizations and the ir Sponsored Pa rticipants. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 54538 (September 28, 2 006), 71 FR 59 184 (October 6, 2 006) (SR-Phl x-2006-43). 7 PACE was the Exchange’s order routi ng, deliv ery, execution and r eporting s ystem for its equity trading flo or. The Commission notes tha t XLE co mmenced lim ited operations o n Novem ber 10, 2006 . 8 Although the fees proposed herein have been file d to beco me immediately effective, the fees will not becom e operative until the Exchange discon tinues its phy sical equities trading floor and commences o peration of X LE. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 54538 (Septem ber 28, 2006), 71 FR 5918 4 (Octob er 6, 200 6) (S R-Phlx-200 6-43) (order ap provin g XLE rules). The Commission notes that XLE commenced lim ited operations on No vember 10, 2 006. 9 The Stock Cl earing Corpor ation of Ph iladelphia (“SCCP”) filed a separate proposed rule change with the Commission to amend its fee s chedule to re flect fee s asso ciated with the trade proces sing of equity securities through SCCP in connection with XLE.

prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the m ost significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organ ization’s Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory B asis for, the Proposed Rule Change Purpose The purpose of the proposed ru le change is to adopt a f ee schedule for the trading of equity s ecurities on the Excha nge in connection with XLE. The XLE fee schedule includes transaction fees (execution and routing fees), covered sale fees , and system fees, as well as a market data revenue sharing proposal. Changes to Appendix A of the Exchange’s fee schedule include perm it fees, application fees, and a m odified exam ination fee, as well as the d eletion of certain f loor-based f ees. All the p roposed f ees will be a ssesse d on Exchange m embers or member organizations, which m ay include Sponsoring Mem ber Organizations,10 (collectively referred to herein as “m ember organizations ”). Sponsoring Mem ber Organizations are responsible for the fees generated by their Sponsored Participant’s activities. Transaction Fees With respect to securities trading at or above $1.00, the Exchange intends to charge member organizations an execution fee, ra nging from $0.0026 to $0.003 per share, depending on the num ber of total sh ares executed monthly,11 for orders that rem ove liquidity from XLE. 10 A Sponsoring Mem ber Org anization is a mem ber organization that has authorized access to XLE for a Sponsor ed Participant (a person who has acce ss to XLE which is authorized by a Sponsor ing Mem ber Org anization). See Phlx Rules 1(jj) and 1(kk). 11 The “total m onthly shares” executed includes executions resulting from removing and providing liquidity on XLE and crosses exe cuted on XLE, as well as share s executed when routed via X LE to an away trading center and executed on that aw ay trading center, except for li quidit y provided by incom ing NMS Linkage Orders or ITS Commit ments. The tot al monthl y shares will be calculated s eparately per XLE Participant Organi zation, which, for purposes of this proposal, refers to Sponsored Participants, Sponso ring Me mber Organizations, and m ember organization s without Sponsored Participants. Thus, Sponsored Part icipant activity will accrete towards that Sponsored Pa rticipant’s v olume tier and not towards t he Sponsori ng Mem ber Organization’s 3

--- Page 3 ---
Additiona lly, the Exchan ge intend s to offer an execution credit to m ember organizations, ranging from $0.002 to $0.0026 per share, for orders that provi de liquidity to XLE. Any available credits would be applied to the m ember organization’ s monthly invoice. Excess credits would be carried over into subsequent m onths or rebate d to the applicable m ember organization, as requested by the m ember organization. The purpose of adopting the volum e tiers in connection with the assessm ent of transaction fees is to encour age XLE Participan t Organizatio ns to send and execute orders on XLE. The volum e tiers are based on the m onthly shares executed per XL E Participant Organiza tion; for Tier 1 (less than or equa l to 10 m illion shar es execu ted), the Exchan ge proposes to assess a fee of $0.003 pe r share executed to rem ove liq uidity and give a credit of $0.002 per s hare executed for providing liquid ity; for Tier 2 (greater th an 10 m illion and less than or equ al to 50 m illion shares ex ecuted ), the Exchange proposes to as sess a fee of $0.0028 per share executed to remove liquidity and give a cred it of $0.0025 per share executed for providing liquidity; for Tier 3 (g reater than 50 m illion and less than or equal to 200 m illion shares executed), the Exchange proposes to assess a fee of $0.0027 per share executed to rem ove liquidity and give a credit of $0.0026 per share executed for providing liquidity; and for Tier 4 (greater than 200 m illion shares ex ecuted), the Exchange pro poses to as sess a fee of $0.0026 per share executed to rem ove liquidity and give a credit of $0.0026 per share executed for providing liquid ity. For each of th e four volum e tiers desc ribed abov e, the Exchange proposes to charg e a flat routing fee of $0.0036 per share executed when an order is routed via XLE to an away trading center and execu ted on that away trading center. volum e tier. Once a specif ic tier has been reached in a m onth, all transactions for that m onth will be subject to t he fee that corresponds with that vo lume tier. See also infra notes 15 and 16. 4

--- Page 4 ---
In addition, in lieu of the above-referenced execution fees , the Exchange proposes to adopt a separate execution fee for securities executed on XLE at a per share price below $1.00 that rem ove liquidity. For these securiti es, the E xchange would charge 0.1% ( i.e., 10 basis points) of the total dollar value of the transaction. The Exchange is not proposing an execution fee credit for providing liquidity for shares with a per share price below $1.00. Such executed volum e for securities trading below $1.00 will a ccrete towards the volu me tier breakpoint per XLE Participant Organization. Additional transaction f ees are set f orth on the proposed fee schedul e under the heading “Miscellaneous Transaction Fees.” Miscellan eous Transaction Fees would be assessed in lieu of the general transaction f ees desc ribed above. The Exchange propos es to adopt an execution fee of $0.0023 per share per side for Imm ediate or Cancel (“IOC”) Cross Orders and Mid-Point Cross Orders entered over technology provided by Phlx.12 The Exchange is not proposing to adopt any transaction fees ( i.e., execution fee for rem oving li quidity or execution credit for providing liquidity) for execu tions of IOC Cross Orders13 and Mid-Point Cross Orders14 with respect to orders entered over technology that is not provided by the Exchange. There also would be no execution credit for any IOC Cro ss or Mid-Point Cross transactions, whether 12 Phlx inten ds to prov ide opt ional technol ogy to XLE P articipants for the entr y of two-sided ord ers into XLE. 13 IOC Cross Orders are two-sided orders that match i mmediately and autom atically on XLE the identified buy-side with the identified sell-side. Specifically , an IO C Cross Orde r is a two-sided order that executes, in its entirety, at the speci fied price, provided that XLE will cancel an IOC Cross Order at the tim e of order entr y under certain conditi ons. See Phlx Rules 185(c) and 185(c)(2). 14 A Mid-Point Cross Order is a two-sided order that executes, in its entirety, at the midpoint of the best Protected Bid and the best Protected Offer in a security . These orders will match immediately and autom atically on XLE the identifie d buy -side wit h the identifie d sell-side. See Phlx Rules 185(c) and 185(c)(1). 5

--- Page 5 ---
entered over technology provided by Phlx or not.15 In addition, in conne ction with IOC Cross Orders and Mid-Point Cross Or ders entered over technology provi ded by Phlx, there would be a $50 m aximum fee per trade side. The execution fee for Odd Lot Orders16 would be $0.003 per share executed, which applie s to or ders in itially enter ed as Odd Lot Or ders and executed in XL E. There would be no execution cr edit f or ord ers initially e ntered as Odd Lot Orders and executed on XLE. Also, for incom ing NMS Linkage Orders or ITS Comm itments routed to Phlx and executed on XLE, the Exchange proposes to charge $0.003 per share for rem oving liquidity.17 The Exchange is proposing to delete from its Summ ary of E quity Charges the Outbound ITS fee and Net Inbound ITS Credit, since the Exchange will no longer assess an Outbound ITS fee or give a Net Inbound ITS Credit. Covered Sale Fee The Exchange will con tinue to cha rge a Covered Sale Fee. Each m ember and m ember organization engaged in executing sale tr ansactions on the Exchange or executing transactions, which were routed over the Interm arket Trading System or pursuant to the NMS Linkage Plan, 15 Executed vol ume for IOC Cross and Mid-Point Cross Orders, whether entered over technolog y provided by the Exchange or not, will accrete towards the volum e tier breakpoint per XLE Participant Organization that is a party to the execution. 16 An Odd Lot Order means an order for l ess than a round lot, which is defined for purposes of XLE as a unit of tr ading that is 100 shares. See Phlx Rules 1(w) and 1(g g). Executed volum e for orders initially entered as Odd Lot Orders a nd execu ted on XLE will accr ete towards the volum e tier breakpoin t per XLE Participant Organization. 17 This fee will be assessed o n the m ember orga nization sponsoring the NMS Linkage Order or ITS Commitment or, if there is no m ember organi zation sponsorin g the NMS Linkag e Order or ITS Commitment, on the excha nge or the Par ticipant in the National Association of Se curities Dealers, Inc. Alternative Display Facilit y (“ADF Part icipant”) sending the ITS C ommit ment or NMS Linkag e Order. The arrangem ent to charge other exchanges or ADF Partici pants was par t of separate pr oposed rule c hanges that were approved by the Commission. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 545 48 (Sept ember 29, 20 06), 7 1 FR 59 159 (October 6, 20 06) (SR- Phlx-20 06-58) and 54 555 ( October 2, 20 06), 7 1 FR 59 577 (October 10, 2 006) (S R-Phlx-200 6­ 60). 6

At this tim e, how ever, the Exchange does not intend to charge for monthly Drop Copy Feeds,21 Monthly Phlx System s,22 or Depth of Book Data Feeds.23 Marketing Data Revenue Sharing In addition, the Exchange is proposing to adopt a quarterly m arket data revenue sharing program that would provide for 50% of gross m arket data revenue to be sh ared with th e member organization responsible fo r providing the liquidity portion of the trade. Sponsored Participant trades will be credited to the applicable Sponsoring Mem ber Or ganization. Any m arket data revenue would be paid to the applicable member organization on a quarterly basis. 18 See Phlx Rul e 607 and Sec urities Exchange Act Release No. 54555 (October 2, 2006), 71 FR 5957 7 (Octob er 10, 20 06) ( SR-Phlx-200 6-60) (am ending Phl x Rule 607). See also Partial Amendment No. 1, supra note 3 (m aking conform ing edits to the C overed Sale Fee rule text to reflect the amended version of Phlx Rule 607). A Sponsoring Member Organization is responsible for the Covered Sale Fees generated in connection wit h its Sponsored Participant’ s sale trans actions. 19 The Financial Inform ation eXchange (“FIX”) Protocol is a messaging standard de veloped specifically for the real-time electronic exchange of securities tran sactions. 20 A port is defi ned as an Internet Protocol (“IP”) address assigned by the Exchange for connectivit y to XLE. 21 The Drop Copy Feed provides real-ti me inform ation c oncerning tra des executed by an XLE Participant Organization and will be pr ovided on a subscription bas is. 22 The Monthl y Phlx S ystem s Fee refers to the use of opt ional Phlx technolo gy to enter in two-sided orders and related clearing inform ation. 23 The Depth of Book feed dis plays ever y order, except the undispla yed porti on of a Reserve Order, within XLE at each price level and will be provide d, on a subscription basis, at no charge to anyone who s ubscribes to receive this information. 7

The m arket data revenue sharing will apply to all securities: T ape A, Tape B, and Tape C. Although there is a difference in the m anner in which the underlying Tape A and Tape B, revenue versus Tape C revenue is distributed to Phlx and the other na tional secu rities exchanges24 there is no d ifference in the m anner in which m ember organization s will share in Tape A and B revenue v ersus Tape C revenue because the p roposed ru le language bases the credits on revenue attributable to the executions of a m ember organization. Thus, a m ember organization responsible for providi ng the liquidity portion of the trade will receive 50% of the revenue attributable to its executions reported to each of the three tapes.25 Deleting Ob solete Fees In connection with adopting the XLE fee schedul e for the trading of equity securities on the Exchange, the Exchange proposes to delete the obsolete fees curren tly listed on the Summ ary of Equity Charges,26 which includes deleting references to license fees assessed in connection with the trading of certain produc ts. Although the Exchange m ay curre ntly, or in the future, be a party to a license fee agreem ent with a lic ensor in connectio n with the tr ading of certain products, the Exchange does not pr opose to assess license fees in connection with X LE at this time. The Exchange would subm it a separate propos ed rule c hange if it decides to ass ess license fees in the f uture. 24 Tape A and Tape B revenue is currently distributed to Phlx and national securities exchanges based on the number of tra des reported, while Tape C revenue is distributed based on an avera ge of num ber of trades and nu mber of shares reported. 25 The Exchange states that t he proposed market data revenue sharing program is sim ilar to program s implemented by other self-regulator y organizations. See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 53860 (May 2 4, 2006), 71 FR 3125 0 (Ju ne 1, 20 06) ( SR-NSX-2006-07). 26 The Covered Sale Fee, however, will conti nue t o be assessed in connection wit h XLE. 8

The Exchange also proposes to delete refere nces to SCCP custom er and specialist fees on the Exchange’s Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking S tockSM Fee Schedule27 to reflect chang es that were proposed in a separate S CCP fee filing.28 Appendix A Appendix A of the Exchange’s fee schedule co ntains general fees that a re curren tly assessed on m embers, foreign curre ncy options (“FCO”) participan ts, m ember organizations, or FCO participant organizations that are not transaction-based, such th at many of the fees relate to gaining access to trading on the Exchange or be ing physically present on the trading floor. As set forth below, the Exchange intends to adopt, m odify, or delete, as appr opriate, several fees to accomm odate the trading of equity securities on XLE. The Exchange proposes to adopt perm it fees rela ted to the trading of equity securities on XLE. Currently, the Exchange assesses a perm it fee to ac cess trad ing on th e Exchange. Perm it fees are ass essed based o n how each perm it is use d. Specifica lly, th e Exch ange will ch arge an Order Flow Provider a perm it fee of $200 per m onth to subm it orders to X LE only and $300 per month to subm it orders to m ore than one trading venue ( i.e., XLE, foreign currency options trading floor, or options trad ing floor). Mem bers who are reg istered as Market Mak er Authorized Traders29 will be charged $ 1,200 per month fo r the first perm it and $1,000 per m onth 27 The Nasdaq- 100®, Nasdaq-100 I ndex ®, Nasdaq®, The Nasdaq Stock Market®, Nasdaq-100 Shares,SM Nasdaq-100 Tru st,SM Nasdaq-100 In dex Tr acking Stock,SM and QQQSM are trade marks or service marks of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.

for each add itional permit for m embers in the same mem ber organiz ation. If a m ember organization only sponsors a Sponsored Partic ipant and does not have any other trading functions, the perm it holder associated with that member organization wi ll be charged a perm it fee of $1,200 per m onth and $1,000 per m onth for additional perm its for m embers in the sam e member organization. The perm it fees will be assessed consistent with current practices. For example, any member who is associated with one or more member organizations and uses a perm it in more than one category will pay the higher of the applicable fees each m onth for such perm it.30 In addition, perm its m ay not be transferred from one perm it holder associated with one m ember organization to a perm it holder associated with a different m ember organi zation, thus a Transfer Fee is in applicable f or permits rela ting to XLE tra ding.31 Excess perm it fees32 will c ontinue to a pply, but will be expande d to inc lude XLE users. Therefore, perm it holders m ay be de signated as “excess” perm it holders in cases where perm it holders in the sam e organization, other than the perm it holder who qualifies the m ember organization, are either: (1) not floor brokers, specialists, ROTs (including RSQTs and SQTs), Off-Floor Traders, Market Maker Authorized Traders, or an XLE Spons oring Mem ber Organization whose only function is to sponsor a Sponsored Participant; or (2) not associated with a m ember organ ization th at meets th e defi nition of an O rder Flow Provider, which now Participant Authorized User means an in dividua l authorized b y a mem ber organization or a Sponsored Pa rticipant to en ter or ders, on its behalf, on XLE. See Phlx Rules 1(m ) and 1(x). 30 See Securities Exchange Act Release No . 49157 ( January 30, 2004) , 69 FR 5883 (February 6, 2004) (SR-P hlx-200 4-02). 31 Permits, how ever, may be transferred within a member organization without i ncurring a Transfer Fee. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 49157 (January 30, 2004), 69 FR 5883 (Febr uary 6, 20 04) (SR- Phlx-20 04-02). 32 See Securities Exchange Act Release No s. 49856 (June 15, 2004), 69 FR 34411 ( June 21, 2004) (SR-Phlx-200 4-32) and 53043 (Decem ber 29, 20 05), 71 FR 95 9 (January 6, 2006) (SR-Phlx­ 2005- 72). 10

include s sub mitting orde rs to XLE. The rate remains unchan ged. Thus, m ember organiza tions that have excess perm it holders will continue to be assessed $200 for each “excess” perm it. The Exchange also proposes to charge Spons oring Mem ber Organiza tions an application fee of $1,850.00 for each Sponsored Pa rticipant that it proposes to sponsor to help offset the costs associated with th e processing of the application, incl uding adm inistrative costs associated with reviewing the application a nd creating the appropriate accounts.33 The Account Fee also will conti nue to apply to m ember organi zations that trade on XL E. Currently, th e Exchange charges m ember organization s a monthly fee of $50.00 for each accoun t beyond the num ber of perm its billed to that m ember organization.34 Therefore, if a m ember organization sponsors a Sponsored Participan t and estab lishes a new acco unt, each account beyond the num ber of perm its billed to that m ember organization would be subject to the $50.00 fee. In addition, any equity floor-based fees, such as p ost and booth space fees, would no longer app ly to m embers or m ember organization s due to th e fact that th ere will no lon ger be a physical equity trading floor.35 The Exchange will not assess these equity floor-based fees for 33 This fee is the same am ount as the Exchange ’s curre nt application ($350.00) and initiation fees ($1,50 0) combined for m embers and mem ber organizations. 34 Each account may have 22 suffixes or s ub-accounts. For exam ple, account number 202 can actually be us ed as account s 202-A, 20 2-B, etc. There is no additi onal charge for suffixes assigned within the sam e account. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 53046 (Januar y 3, 2006), 71 FR 1459 (January 9, 2006) (S R-Phlx-200 5-89). 35 Exam ples of these floor-based fees inclu de trading post/booth spac e, controller space, floor facility , direct wire to the floor, telephone sy stem line extension, trading fl oor per sonnel registration, com puter equipment services, repa irs or replacements, and com puter relocation requests. These fees will remain on Appendix A to reflect that they will still be assessed on mem bers, participants, and mem ber or particip ant orga nizations on t he optio ns and/or foreign currency options trading fl oors. 11

any part of the m onth in which XLE is launched.36 These f ees will r emain on the f ee sc hedule as applicable to the Exchange’s other trading floors. The Exchange proposes to delete from the f ee schedule any f ees applicable only to the equity trading floor, such as the stock execution machine registration fee, due to the f act th at there will no longer be a physical equity trading floor. Additiona lly, the E xchange proposes to delete all Re mote Specia list fees,37 since Rem ote Specia lists will not exis t in XLE. Apart from the launch of XLE and merely to update th e fee s chedule, the Exchange also proposes to delete the “Equity, Option or FC O Transm ission Charge” and the “FCO Pricing Tape” fees b ecause the E xchange will no longer b e provid ing these serv ices. Thus, a charge for these se rvices will no t be assess ed. The Exchange also proposes to delete its Off-Floor Exam inations Fee of $30.00 per month per off-floor trader and, in turn, am end its Exam inations Fee. The implem entation of a tiered m onthly Exam inations Fee will rep lace the Off-Floor Exam inations Fee. Curre ntly, th e Exchange assesses a m onthly fee of $30.00 per off-fl oor trader for off-floo r traders associated with m ember organizations for whom the Exch ange is the Designated Exam ining Authority (“DEA”).38 With the closing of the E xchange’s equ ity trading floor, traders that previously physically traded on the floor of the Exchange (and for whom the Exchange was the DEA for their m ember organizatio n) will no lo nger be cons idered “on-f loor trade rs,” but will no w be 36 For exam ple, if XLE is launched in m id-November, no equity floor-based fees fr om Appendix A will be assessed for the m onth of November. 37 Specifically , these fee s include the Re mote Speci alist System Fee, Remote Speci alist Security Routing Fee, Rem ote Speci alist Teleco mmunica tions Installation Fee, Rem ote Sp ecialist Teleco mmunications Fee, Re mote Speci alist Equipm ent Installation Fee, and Rem ote Speciali st Equipm ent Rental Fee. 38 See Securities Exchange Act Release No . 53643 (A pril 13, 2006), 71 FR 20151 ( April 19, 2006) (SR-Phlx-200 6-23). 12

designated as “off-floor traders” and therefor e would now fall under and be assessed the Off- Floor Exam inations Fee.39 To address the unintend ed conseque nces tha t XLE would now cover add itional trade rs that previously were not covered under the O ff-Floor Exam inations Fee, the Exchange is proposing to delete the O ff-Floor Exam inations Fee and adopt a tiered Exam inations Fee based on the num ber of off-floor trad ers in a m ember organization.40 Specifically, a member organization will be assessed a m onthly fee of $2,100 for one to ten off-floor trad ers; $2,600 for eleven to fifty off-floor trad ers; $5,000 for fifty-one to two hundred off-floor traders; and $12,500 for over two hundred off-floor traders in th e sam e member organization. The following member organiza tions w ill continu e to be exem pt from the Exam inations Fee, consis tent with curren t practice: (1) inactive organizations;41 and (2) organizations operating through one or more Phlx trading venues that dem onstrated that 25% or m ore of its revenue as reflected on the most recen tly subm itted FOCUS Report or trans actions as reflected on its purchase an d sales blotter are derived from securities transactions on the Phlx. The Exchange proposes to elim inate the followin g exem ptions to clarif y and sim plify the application of the Exam inations Fee: (1) the exem ption category for m ember organizations f or any m onth where they incur transaction or clearing fees charged d irectly by the Exchange or by its register ed clearing subsidiary, provided 39 The Exam inations Fee is applicable to member/participant organi zations for whom the Exchange is the DEA, unless an exe mption to the asse ssment of the Exam inations Fee applies. See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 46392 (August 21, 2002), 67 FR 552 94 (August 28, 2002) (SR-Phlx-200 2-45) and 42562 (March 2 2, 2000), 65 FR 1644 5 (M arch 28, 20 00) (SR-Phlx-0 0­ 18). 40 For purposes of assessing the proposed t iered Exam inations Fee, Sponsored Part icipants are not included in the calculation of the num ber of off-floor traders in a Sponsoring M ember Organization. 41 In connection with am ending the Exam inations Fee as described above, the definition of an inactive organization is being m odified slightl y so that it will be defined as an organization that had no securities transaction revenue, as deter mined by FOCUS reports or other financial filings, as long as the organization continues to have no such revenue each month. 13

that the fees exceed th e exam ination fee for that m onth and (2) the exem ption for m ember organiz ations affiliated with a m ember organ ization exem pt from the Exam ination Fee due to the exem ption listed imm ediately above or the ex emption if that m ember organization is affiliated with a m ember organization operating from the Phlx trading floor or as a Re mote Specialist which have dem onstrated that at least 25 % or more of their incom e as reflected on the m ost recen tly sub mitted FOCUS Report was derived fr om floor activ ities or rem ote specialis t activ ities. The proposed revised Exam inations Fee, which would apply to m any of t he members currently covered by the Off-Floor Exam inations Fee, should more efficiently and effectively assess m ember organizations for recovery of re gulatory-related costs related to conducting exam inations and should clarify how the Exam inations Fee will be assessed in connection with the m ember organization s that trad e equity securities on XLE.42 Finally, the Exchange proposes to renum ber the footnotes on the Exchange’s fee schedule to reflect the changes described above. Statutory Basis The Phlx believes that the proposed rule change to am end its schedule of fees is consistent w ith Section 6(b) of the Act,43 in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,44 in pa rticular, in th at it is de signed to assu re the equ itable alloca tion of reasonable fees and other charges among its m ember s and other persons using its facilities. 42 The proposed Exam ination s Fee would be im plement ed the first full m onth after XLE is launched. For exam ple, if XLE is launched in m id-Novem ber, the current off-floor Exam inations Fee will apply for the m onth of Novem ber and the Exam inations Fee set forth in this proposal would be assessed beginning with the m onth of Dece mber. 43 15 U.S.C. 7 8f(b). 44 15 U.S.C. 78f (b)(4). 14
