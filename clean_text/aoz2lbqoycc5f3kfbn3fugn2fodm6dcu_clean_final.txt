1 Final Report 1 October 2011 – 30 September 2013 Project Title : A Retrospective Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Growth and Abundance of Juvenile Anadromous Fis hes in the Maryland Chesapeake Bay NOAA Grant Number : NA11NMF4570219 NOAA Funds Awarded : $52,000 Project Duration : 24 months; 1 October 2011 to 30 September2013 Co-Principal Investigators : William J. Connelly, Edward D. Houde Institution : University of Maryland Center fo r Environmental Science, Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, P.O. Box 38, Solomons, MD 20688 SYNOPSIS Recruitment success of anadromous fishes (s triped bass, white perch and alosines) in Maryland tributaries to Chesapeake Bay vari es dramatically from year to year. Additionally, the tributar ies and their watersheds differ in the degree of human development and impact that may affect reproductive success and productivity of anadromous fishes. In this project we undertook a retros pective analysis of data on abundance, sizes, growth rates, and production of young-of-the-year (YOY) anadromous fishes based on data from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Juvenile Striped Bass Seine Surv ey that has been conducted since 1959. Additionally, data on taxable structures located within three watersheds (Choptank, Nanticoke, and Patuxent rivers) were analyz ed as a proxy for level of human activity and anthropogenic stress to eval uate potential effects of watershed development on growth, distribution, and abundan ce of YOY anadromous fishes . Significant increases in the combined-taxa abundance and biom ass of YOY anadromous fishes were detected in the subestuaries t hat were sampled over the full time course of the DNR surveys. Abundances of the YOY alosines group declined significantly in the Choptank River but increased in the Potomac River, attributable to incr easing numbers of YOY American shad in the Potomac. Significant negative tempor al trends in mean lengths were detected for some YOY anadromous fish taxa. Despite the apparent trends in abundance and biomass, only a few of the tr ends in net production of anadromous fishes were judged to be significant. Shi fts in spatial distribution of some YOY anadromous fishes occurred during the 53-yr time series, with observed shifts in centers of abundance being primarily down- estuary in some tributar ies. Principal components analyses identified correlations and temporal patterns among water quality parameters, freshwater flow, anadromous fish abundanc es and their centers of abundance.

2Research initiated in this project is being continued under funding from Maryland DNR via the Atlantic States Mari ne Fisheries Commission. Analyses on a suite of biotic and abiotic variables to identify and evaluate s ources of interannual variability in abundance, sizes, and growth rates of YOY anadrom ous fishes are being conducted in the continuing research. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND This is the Final Report for NOAA Gr ant NA11NMF4570219. The research was conducted in response to a NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office RFP priority requesting retrospective analyses of l ong-term monitoring data to dev elop resource management products. The project was initiated on 1 October 2011 and was funded for a single year. A one-year no-cost extension wa s granted that extende d the project to 30 September 2013. This research is cont inuing under a contract from Maryland Department of Natural Resources (Contract Number K00B3400024) via the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission for t he period 16 July 2012 to 15 July 2014. Anadromous fishes, including striped bass, white perch, and alosines (American shad, hickory shad, alewife, and blueback herring) are ecologically and economically important in Chesapeake Ba y. Recruitment success of many anadromous fishes exhibits more than 10-fold in ter-annual variability in the Bay. While the recruitment levels of these fishes are correlated among Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay tributaries (Kraus and Secor 2005; Wood and Austin 2009), the contribution of YOY recruits by each tributary depends on numerous factors in addition to watershed size or areal extent of available habitat. Watersheds of each of the tributaries have experienced different land use patterns and nutrient loading regimes that can affect carrying capacity and production potential (Carlisle et al. 2013). The proximity of many of the spawning and nursery grounds in Maryland to urbanized areas makes these species especial ly sensitive to anthropogenic influences (Schaaf et al. 1993; Uphoff 2008). Analyses c onducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) indicated negativ e relationships between the area of impervious surface (IS) within a watershed, dissolved oxygen concentrations, and abundance of juvenile anadromous fishes in several small Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River tributaries (McGinty et al . 2006; Uphoff 2008; Uphoff et al. 2011). Furthermore, the occurrences of white perch and yellow perch eggs, larvae, and adults were diminished in the Bush River watershed in 2006 (IS coverage = 13%) relative to 1973 (IS coverage = 9%) (Uphoff et al. 2007). Re lationships among long-term trends in nutrients and dissolved oxygen (Hagy et al. 2004; Kemp et al. 2005; Testa et al. 2008; Prasad et al. 2010; Williams et al. 2010) and changes in land use and agricultural practices in Chesapeake watersheds and the Bay have been documented (Cronin and Vann 2003; Kemp et al. 2005; McGinty et al . 2006; Uphoff et al. 2011; Williams et al. 2010). The research conducted by DNR on watersheds differing in IS coverage was limited to data collected during a 3-year per iod. We evaluated relationships among long-term trends in abundance, growth, and production of young-of-the-year (YOY)

OBJECTIVES • Quantify differences and trends in abunda nce, size, and growth rate among YOY anadromous fishes in Maryland’s upper Chesapeake Bay and tributaries. • Document shifts in distributions of YOY anadromous fishes in Maryland’s upper Chesapeake Bay and tributaries and relate to human habitation/land-use. • Compare the historical abundance of zooplankton and benthic prey organisms for YOY anadromous fishes across tribut aries and quantify temporal trends. • Evaluate relationships between YOY fish, their zooplankton/benthos prey, environmental variables, and land use metrics. METHODS AND APPROACHES Monitoring Data The Maryland Department of Natural Re sources Juvenile Striped Bass Seine Survey ( http://www.dnr.state.md.us/fisheries/juvindex/) has collected, enumerated, and measured YOY anadromous fishes in the Ma ryland tributaries of the Bay since 1957 (Figure 1). The systems sampled since init iation of the survey include the Potomac River, the Choptank River, the Nanticoke River, and the head of the Bay. The Patuxent River has been sampled since 1983. Ther e are multiple permanent and auxiliary sampling sites in each system. Each site is sampled once each month in July, August, and September using a 30.5-m x 1.24-m bag- less beach seine of untreated 6.4-mm bar mesh. The time series is sufficiently long to capture shifts in abundance that appear to be related to changes in freshwater flow patterns, other environ mental variables, and adult spawning stock biomasses. These dat a were analyzed to compare trends and differences in abundance, growth rates and biomass across tributaries under varying environmental conditions. With the except ion of the Choptank River, only the sites sampled continuously in each tributary since the beginning of the survey were used in the analyses. In the Choptank River, only one site was sampled continuously since the beginning of the survey. However, replacem ent sites were selected in close proximity to the original sites and these were assu med to be representative of the respective regions of the Choptank River. The Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) has monitored water quality, species composition and abundance of mesozooplankton (through 2002), and the species composition and abundance of benthi c organisms at fixed stations in Maryland since 1984 (Figure 1). Additional water qualit y data collected by the Chesapeake Bay

4Institute dating back to 1949 are available. These data are being analyzed in the continuation phase of the pr oject (with MD DNR and ASMFC support) to evaluate the potential of each tributary to support YO Y anadromous fishes and to compare trends and patterns in the seine survey data. Figure 1. Map of the Maryland portion of Chesapeake Bay and tributaries. Sampling sites included in the analyses described in this report are represented by symbols. The sites are seine-sampling sites from the Maryland DNR Striped Bass Juvenile Index Survey (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/ fisheries/juvindex/) Data on taxable structures from the Maryland State Department of Assessment and Taxation (SDAT) were incorporated into an analysis that examines anthropogenic alteration of the watershed and its relationship to abundance and growth of YOY anadromous fishes, shifts in water quality, and changes in land-use. The taxable structures data were selected for analysi s because SDAT has collected data annually on the number and foundation foot print area of structures in each Maryland county since 1950. Additionally, area occupied by ta xable structures has been reported to be strongly, positively correlated with estimates of impervious surface coverage (J. Uphoff, unpublished data). Analyses Annual mean abundance (number per 100 m 2) and biomass (grams wet weight per 100 m2) estimates were calculated for alewife ( Alosa pseudoharengus ), blueback herring ( Alosa aestivalis) , American shad ( Alosa sapidissima ), striped bass ( Morone saxatilis ), and white perch ( Morone americana ). Area swept by the MD DNR seine in a deployment was estimated using a quarter ci rcle sweep or an approximately-trapezoidal sweep depending on the fraction of the seine’s length that was deployed in a seine set (Martino and Houde 2012). The density (num ber per square meter) of each species was estimated for each sampling site duri ng the survey each y ear, and the annual mean

--- Page 4 ---
5density was then calculated for each tribut ary (upper Chesapeake Bay, Choptank River, Nanticoke River, Patuxent River, and Po tomac River). Length-to-wet-weight conversions were used to obtain a relative bi omass estimate for each species at each sampling site. The number of ye ars in the biomass time series differs for each species. Striped bass was the only species for which l ength was measured from the beginning of the seine survey (1957). White perch lengths were recorded since 1971 and the lengths of the alosines (alewife, Americ an shad, and blueback herring) since 1991. Abundance and biomass for each species were estimated using only the survey sites at which a species occurred at least twice sinc e the beginning of the survey. Prior to analysis, one-half of the minimum, non-zero abundance or biomass estimate for each tributary-species combination was added to all ze ro-catch sites in the tributary to allow inclusion of zero abundance values in a log- transformed data analysis. Trends in the transformed abundance and biomass data were identified and quantified using linear regression. Trends in the sizes of YOY anadromous fi shes over the survey years were quantified by examining median total lengths in September . Median lengths, rather than mean lengths, were analyzed because medians tend to be less sensitive to outliers. The analysis of growth rates was based on diffe rences in median length of fish between the August and September surveys. An index of net production of each s pecies from August to September was calculated for each tributary by subtracti ng the mean relative biomass estimated in August from the mean relative biomass in September and then di viding by the number of days between the two sampling events. Patterns or trends over years in the spatial distribution of each species were evaluated by estimating the center of abundanc e of each species in each system for the entire seine survey time series. The cent er of abundance was calculated as a weighted mean location (distance from t he mouth of each tributary to each survey sampling site), with the location weighted by the abundance of each species collected at each site. A principal components analysis was c onducted to examine and evaluate relationships among fish density for each s pecies with respect to their centers of abundance, freshwater flow, water quality variables, and the nu mber of taxable structures in each watershed. Monthl y mean freshwater discharge data for the Susquehanna, Choptank, Nanticok e, Patuxent, and Potomac rivers were retrieved from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information Survey (USGS 2012). Water quality data, including water tem perature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll a, dissolved nitrate + nitrite, and di ssolved phosphate, collected from 1985 to 2010, the first and last available full years of data, were downloaded from the Chesapeake Bay Progr am (CBP) website (http://www.chesapeakebay.net/data/downl oads/cbp_water_quality_database_1984_pr esent ). These variables were chosen because they provide biologically relevant information about environmental conditions wit hin each tributary and because there were few missing observations (less than 10% ). Mean values for each water quality

--- Page 5 ---
6variable and the flow data from each tributary were calculated for spring (March, April, May) and summer (June, July, and August) because conditions during these two seasons strongly influence the survival and growth of anadromous fish larvae and juveniles (North and Houde 2001, 2003, 2006; Martino and Houde 2010, 2012). Data on taxable structures were available only for the Choptank, Nanticoke, and Patuxent river watersheds. PROGRESS Abundance and biomass There were several significant trends in the abundance of anadromous fishes included in the analysis. Herein, we firs t report on the abundances and biomasses of combined groups of taxa and species and t hen on the individual species. Striped bass and white perch data were combined into a moronid group while the data for American shad and the river herrings were combined into an alosine group. Finally, the data for all five species were combined into an anadromous group. Abundance Combined Groups While there were periods of below-a verage abundance (i.e., density) for each of the groups from 1957 to approximately 1960, and again in the 1980s, the abundances of YOY anadromous fishes, most notably the moronid group, tended to exhibit positive trends since the beginning of the time series , which is consistent with patterns reported by Martino and Houde (2012) for striped bass and Wood and Austin (2009) for a suite of species. Conversely, with the exception of the Potomac River where YOY alosine abundances increased, alosine abundances were declining throughout the time series (Figure 2). The trends in abundance were fa irly consistent among tributaries and within species groups, although slopes often were not st atistically different fr om zero (Table 1). Alosine abundance was more variable t han the moronid or anadromous groups because of frequent extreme high and low ca tches. Trends in the anadromous group abundance appear to be mostly driven by t he moronid group, with absolute abundance scaled upwards by large alosine catches. N egative trends in abundance across groups within the Choptank River may be a consequence of the spatial distribution of survey sites in this tributary, which included only one site in the tidal fresh region. This site was excluded from our analysis because it was not sampled until 1984.

9Abundance Species-specific The significant, positive trend in Poto mac River alosine abundance (Table 1) reflects a concurrent significant incr ease in Potomac River YOY American shad abundance over the time series (Table 2; Figur e 3). Similarly, decreasing trends in alosine-group abundance follow dec reasing trends in the constituent species across the systems investigated (Table 2). Except in the Head of Bay, YOY alewife decreased across systems, although the trend was only significant within the Choptank. YOY blueback herring was the most variable in abundance of the alosines investigated, differing three orders of magnitude among year s. Bluebacks declined significantly in the Choptank River but not in the ot her systems (Table 2; Figure 3). YOY white perch exhibited the most significant abundance trends. With the exception of the Choptank, in which a s light, but not significant, negative trend was observed, trends in abundance were positive and comparatively large (Table 2; Figure 4).Trends in YOY striped bass abundance were cons istently flat, with little evidence of any significant, long-term change in abundance in these systems.

Biomass Combined Groups With the exception of the Patuxent River , which had the shortest duration in the DNR survey, there were significant, positive trends in the biomass of YOY moronids. Biomass of YOY alosines, which could on ly be estimated since 1990, exhibited no significant trends in any of the systems (Figur e 5, Table 3). No slopes of the trends in biomass for the combined YOY alosine or anadr omous fishes differed significantly from zero in any of the systems for the period 1990 to present. There were fewer significant trends in the biomass data than in the abundance data, primarily becau se of the shorter period of data availability on fish sizes in the survey.

15Biomass Species-specific YOY American shad had significant pos itive trends in biomass within the Nanticoke and Potomac Rivers (Figure 6, Table 4). There were, however, no significant trends in biomass in any of the systems for YOY alewife or blueback herring. YOY white perch had strongly significant positive tr ends in biomass in all systems except the Choptank River. The slopes for the significant trends were similar, ranging from 0.0260- 0284 log 10 grams wet weight 100 m-2 year-1 (Figure 7, Table 4). Conversely, slopes of the trends in YOY striped bass biomass over the time series were near-zero and not significant, indicating that the trends in white perch biomass drove the observed biomass trends in the combined moronid group.

Length, growth, and production Length The analysis of median lengths in Sept ember indicated six significant negative trends (Figure 8, Table 5) and no significant positive trends in length over the survey period. Only YOY striped bass and American shad exhibited significant negative trends in more than one tributary. No signific ant trends in length were observed for YOY alewife or blueback herring.

--- Page 17 ---
18Growth There were no strong or consistent trends in growth rates of the YOY anadromous fishes. Only three close-to-signi ficant trends in August-September growth rates were observed (Table 6). One (whi te perch, Potomac) was positive and two (white perch, Patuxent and American shad, Poto mac) were negative. Trends in growth rates were more variable than trends in medi an length because too few individuals were collected (<5) in several survey years to pr ovide robust estimates. Additionally, there were many years when small individuals cont inued to recruit (become available) to the seine gear in September, which resulted in lo wer or negative estimates of growth rates. We will conduct a modal length progression analysis in the continuation of this research that may provide better and more cons istent growth rate estimates. Table 5.

Alewife, in all systems with the exception of in the upper-Bay, experienced substantial down-estuary shifts of 0.16 to 0.60 km year -1 since the beginning of the survey. Shifts in the center of mass that o ccurred for other species were not consistent, though most up-estuary shifts were not st atistically significant. All species had significant down- estuary shifts in the Choptank River , ranging from 0.45 to 0.75 km year-1. Most trends in the upper Bay were up-bay. Since sites sampled by the DNR seine survey include only one or two stations in upper-Bay tri butaries, the survey design may be inadequate to detect down-estuary shifts.

The first two prin cipal components (PCs) captur ed between 39.6% and 46% of the variance (Figures 9-13). As expected, there were positive correlations in each tributary between freshwater flow and nut rients in both spring and summer. The abundances of YOY anadromous fishes we re generally positively correlated with freshwater flow and loaded highly on PC1, indi cating that freshwater flow and nutrients were important sources of variability in the data. Additionally, there were temporal

--- Page 22 ---
23trends in all five tributaries, due in part to the abundance trends of anadromous fishes during the survey period (described above). However, there also were some differences in the patterns among tributaries. The definitions of variables in the PCA are provided in Table 9. Table 9.

However, the center of abundance for the alosines loaded on PC2, indicating that the centers of abundance for alosines were uncorrelated with their abundances. The center of abundance for striped bass also loaded on PC2 but was negatively correlated with the centers of ab undance for the alosines. The center of abundance for white perch was negatively correlated with white perch abundance, suggesting that the center of abundance for white perch shifts down-estuary in years of higher abundance. The temporal trend for the upper Bay oriented along PC1, indicating that spring and summer flow s, spring and summer nutrient levels, and abundances of YOY anadromous species generally increased from 1985 until 2003. Since 2004, PC1 scores have tended to shift back toward negativ e values similar to those in the late 1980s.

24Choptank River YOY striped bass and white perch abundance s were positively correlated with spring and summer flows and spring (N and P) and summer (N) nutrient levels (Figure 10). However, alewife abundance was negatively correlated with those variables. The center of abundance for striped bass shifted down-estuary in year s of higher striped bass abundance while the cent er of abundance of white perch tended to move up- estuary with increasing white perch abundance. The tempor al trend for the Choptank River progressed from the lower left hand co rner of Figure 10 to the upper right hand corner, toward conditions of higher su mmer nutrient levels, higher summer water temperature, and increasing num bers of taxable structures.

29Strategy and plan for remaining analyses Analyses that we conducted with support fr om the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office evaluated trends in abundance, biomass, l ength, growth, production, and spatial distribution of YOY anadromous fishes. Under the continui ng contract from Maryland DNR and ASMFC, we are analyzing abundanc e trends and patterns of the YOY anadromous fishes and other species (e.g ., Atlantic menhaden) to document inter- annual variability, analyze its causes, and evaluat e effects of variability in abundance on sizes and growth rates of the YOY anadromous fishes. In an extension of analyses completed to date, abundances of YOY and age- 1+ fish of all common species in the DNR seine survey will be included in our prin cipal components analysis. Water quality, zooplankton prey abundance, and benthic pr ey abundance data from the Chesapeake Bay Program will be included in our multivaria te analyses to identify and quantify drivers of interannual variability in growth and production of YOY anadromous fishes.
