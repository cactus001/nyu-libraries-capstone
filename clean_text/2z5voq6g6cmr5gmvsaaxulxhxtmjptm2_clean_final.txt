Other Defense Activities/ Security and Safety Performance Assurance/Overview FY 2007 Congressional BudgetStrategic Context Following publication of the Administration’s National Energy Policy, the Department developed a Strategic Plan that defines its mission, four strategic goals for accomplishing that mission, and seven general goals to support the strategic goals. As stated in the Departmental Strategic Plan, DOE’s Strategic and General Goals will be accomplished not only through the efforts of the major program offices in the Department but with additional effort from offices which support the programs in carrying out the mission. SSA performs critical functions, which directly support the mission of the Department. These functions include developing and promulgating security policies, training, and technology throughout DOE; assisting the United States and other governments track the use and movement of nuclear material; and providing information to the Secretary and other DOE managers regarding the status and effectiveness of the Department’s security and safety program implementation. Mission SSA provides for the development, promulgation, and evaluation of security programs, and the independent oversight of security; cyber security; emergency management; and environment, safety, and health programs throughout the Department; and provides security-related services to DOE Headquarters. SSA also provides administrative support to the Departmental Representative to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. As stated in the Departmental Strategic Plan, DOE’s Strategic and General Goals will be accomplished not only through the efforts of the major program offices in the Department but with additional effort from offices which support the programs in carrying out the mission. SSA performs critical functions that directly support the mission of the Department.

Other Defense Activities/ Security and Safety Performance Assurance/Overview FY 2007 Congressional Budget/squarecent assisting Departmental and other U.S. Governmental organizations in providing adequate protection to national security assets; /squarecentproviding specialized security support services to the Department associated with the development and dissemination of security awareness information; maintenance of various security-related data base systems; management of the foreign ownership, control, or influence and foreign visits, assignments, and travel programs; and conduct of vulnerability assessments in support of the implementation of the Design Basis Threat Policy; /squarecentconducting performance appraisals to verify that the Department’s security interests are protected; the Department can effectively respond to emergencies; and site workers, the public, and the environment are protected from hazardous operations and materials; and, /squarecentproviding support for centralized leadership in resolving Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board issues. Benefits DOE must implement effective security programs in an increasingly challenging threat environment. The primary focus of SSA is on effectively and efficiently implementing protection programs that fully respond to the evolving Design Basis Threat Policy by addressing programmatic and technical uncertainties and establishing cooperation and useful dialog between managers and security professionals at all levels. Towards this end, and in support of the unprecedented security initiatives announced by the Secretary in May 2004, SSA is: 1) streamlining existing security policies to remove ambiguity in roles, responsibilities, and requirements; eliminate conflicts; and incorporate recent updates; 2) emphasizing the deployment of innovative security technology to transition from manpower intensive to engineered systems that provide greater security at reduced lifecycle costs; 3) advancing the professional development of DOE security and safety personnel to ensure that their training is responsive to the needs of the DOE community; 4) increasing the capabilities and responsiveness of the protective force; and 5) improving the defensive posture of DOE. SSA also identifies and reports to senior DOE managers on site-specific and Department-wide issues regarding security, cyber security, emergency management, environment, safety, and health, classification and declassification programs and other programs using an efficient, systematic independent oversight process that emphasizes performance and performance testing; conducts follow- up activities to determine the effectiveness of corrective actions; and promotes line management self- assessment activities, thereby enhancing overall performance in these program areas. In addition, SSA provides cross-organizational support to DOE efforts to resolve Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board-related technical and management issues necessary to ensure public health and safety. Major FY 2005 Achievements /square4Design Basis Threat Site Assistance Visits – In partnership with the National Nuclear Security Administration and Energy, Science, and Environment program and field locations; and Headquarters policy organizations, SSA successfully completed site assistance visits at 11 DOE field sites with the purpose of developing resource-efficient, sustainable protection strategies and assist in the development of realistic budget submissions to support timely implementation of the revised Design Basis Threat Policy.

Other Defense Activities/ Security and Safety Performance Assurance/Overview FY 2007 Congressional BudgetMeans and Strategies SSA will achieve its mission by issuing clear, concise security policies, providing cutting-edge technology-based security solutions, providing world-class training programs for security and safety professionals, and applying rigorous independent oversight to departmental operations. The SSA vision is to provide a sound foundation for protecting the Nation’s nuclear and energy assets through advanced technology deployment and professional development. This vision captures the SSA role within the Department's overall security (including nuclear safeguards and security, cyber security, and information security) and safety (including emergency management, and environment, safety, and health) programs. It also emphasizes the two areas that are necessary for the Department to achieve its mission in the most efficient and effective manner, i.e., increased use of technology and effective management and development of human capital. In order to achieve its vision and perform its goals, it is necessary for SSA to maintain a highly qualified workforce with the expertise and skills necessary to support, manage, and conduct security and independent oversight operations now and in the foreseeable future. The SSA workforce is, and must be, comprised of world-class security and safety professionals grounded in science, engineering, and technology led by effective program and project managers with exceptional communications and marketing skills and supported by innovative resource management experts. SSA requires the technical support of national-level experts to perform all its security, safety, and independent oversight activities. Contractor support continues to be a pr acticable and cost–effective means to provide a surge pool of technical experts, as opposed to expanding the Federal employee base. The following external factor could affect SSA’s ability to achieve its strategic goal, revisions to the Design Basis Threat Policy. Revisions to the Design Basis Threat Policy based on changing geopolitical conditions have the greatest potential for affecting SSA’s mission, priorities, and stated performance targets. Type and number of training courses developed and conducted, type and numbers of technologies deployed, and scope of independent oversight appraisals performed are all dependent and reliant upon current Design Basis Threat Policy timelines and depth of coverage. SSA places a high degree of emphasis on working with DOE program and other staff offices to ensure that security and safety issues are identified and adequately addressed. SSA also interfaces with organizations external to DOE to enhance the security posture of the United States as well as other foreign states that maintain inventories of nuclear material. SSA maintains strong relationships with the following DOE organizations: /squarecentOffice of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) /squarecentOffice of Environment, Safety and Health (EH) /squarecentOffice of Intelligence (IN) /squarecentOffice of Counterintelligence (CN) /squarecentNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) /squarecentOffice of Energy, Science, and Environment (ESE) /squarecentDOE Inspector General (IG)

Significant Policy or Program Shifts /squarecentCivil Penalties for Classified Information Security Violations Implementation : The Secretary of Energy directed SSA to be responsible for implementing Section 234B to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as specified in the final rule in 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 824. The rule implements the requirements for issuing civil penalties for any person who enters into a contract or subcontractwith the Department and who violates any applicable rule, regulation, or Order issued by the Secretary of Energy relating to the safeguarding or security of Restricted Data or other classified or “sensitive information.” Currently security directives are being reviewed to identify and insert appropriate language to account for this activity. SSA is also in the process of developing the means and strategies for full implementation using the current Price Anderson Enforcement program as a model. /squarecentIncreased Emphasis on Technology Deployment : The deployment of security technologies is a key strategy to avoid significant manpower increases that would otherwise be required to conform to the Department’s updated Design Basis Threat Policy. Towards that end, funding will be directed for the purchase and installation of systems determined to have a positive impact on security effectiveness as determined through the Design Basis Threat Site Assistance Visit analysis process.The chosen technologies to be procured will be coordinated with the National Nuclear SecurityAdministration and other DOE program offices to ensure that security and safety requirements are being addressed, that training and systems effectiveness procedures are in place, and that promulgation of lessons learned throughout the complex is accomplished.

Funding provides security awareness coordinators the tools and information needed to communicate information to employees regarding threats to security and the individual’s role within the security program as protection levels and strategies change or are increased. The President’s electronic Government initiative concepts are incorporated into this activity by utilizing electronic information systems for the delivery of required security briefings and other security information. Funding provides for monthly teleconferences, an annual workshop, and a group web site. Information used throughout the DOE security complex regarding security issues related to policy implementation is maintained in the Safeguards and Security Information Management System, a centralized database that serves as the master repository of current and historical DOE security deficiencies, from both internal and external sources, and associated corrective actions. This system allows for the trending and analysis of security issues in order to identify systemic security issues and areas that may require additional oversight, or indicators of continuing or future security concerns within DOE. The database also maintains facility security ratings, a listing of facility security offices for more than 2,000 cleared DOE facilities, classified mailing addresses for over 500 facilities authorized to receive classified matter, and classified contracts and surveys. Funding supports operational and basic maintenance of the database and upgrades to the secure communication hardware. Information regarding incidents involving unauthorized disclosures and compromises of classified information is maintained in the Incident Tracking and Analysis Capability database. Funding supports the operation of the system and routine trending and analysis reports for use by various departmental entities. Funding also provides for field assistance activities associated with the continued rollout of remote incident tracking and analysis terminals at field locations. The electronic foreign ownership, control, or influence (e-FOCI) database system supports the FOCI program designed to determine whether potential or existing contractors of the Department are owned, controlled, or influenced by a foreign entity and, as a result, the potential for undue risk to

Other Defense Activities/ Security and Safety Performance Assurance/Security Investigations FY 2007 Congressional BudgetThe Program Goals of the Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance will be accomplished not only through the efforts of the (GPRA Unit) programs but with additional efforts from subprograms which support the GPRA Units in carrying out their mission. Security Investigations performs the following functions in support of the overall mission of the Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance. Benefits This subprogram provides for the centralized management of access control authorizations (clearances) that allow employees and contractors access to sensitive information, facilities, and material entrusted to DOE thus ensuring national security. Background investigations are performed in accordance with DOEOrder 470.4, Safeguards and Security Program, August 26, 2005, which replaced DOE Order 472.1C Personnel Security Activities, March 25, 2003, by either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Office of Personnel Management, as required by law or Departmental regulations. The Accelerated Access Authorization Program provides a method for granting qualifying new DOE employees and contractors interim “Q” access authorizations within 21 days while the 150 to 300-day background investigation is completed. This allows new hires to begin productive work while affording additional assurances that the national security is being safeguarded. The management of access authorization data is performed in a cost effective, efficient, manner via the use of electronic databases and Internet capable tools that comprise the electronic DOE Integrated Security System (e-DISS+). These electronic tools support and track the adjudication process from the beginning to the disposition of the access authorization request.

The process o f investigating, granting, and subsequent management and tracking of access authorizations is data intensive and requires the maintenance of large amounts of data for long periods of time, both for personnel who are granted access authorizations and for those who are not. The primary system for performing this function is the electronic DOE Integrated Security System (e-DISS+), which consists of a series of interrelated electronic databases and associated client applications and web pages that automate the processing and tracking of access authorization requests and integrate the access control process. An automated Applicant User Interface allows applicants to complete and submit their Questionnaire for National Security Positions (Standard Form-86) over a secure web- based system. The Personnel Security Interface facilitates the collection of SF-86 data for review and allows DOE security personnel to receive, process, review, and submit the information to OPM.This process greatly reduces the amount of time spent on managing and preserving the integrity of the data as the information flows between physical locations and organizations. The e-DISS+ also includes the Central Personnel Clearance Index database that maintains access authorization data at the site and national level. The Visitor Access Database and Classified Visitor Control System contain data in centralized databases for nationwide access by DOE personnel and contractors concerning access authorizations and inter-site visits for use in providing access to facilities and information. The e-DISS+ supports the President’s Management Agenda in the electronic Government initiative, but does not duplicate the e-Clearance authorization initiative managed by OPM. Funding provides for the continued operation and maintenance, as well as modest upgrades in the functionality of these systems, and for the maintenance of system user information. /squarecentAccelerated Access Authorization Program (AAAP) .. 1,200 1,491 2,312 The Accelerated Access Authorization Program (AAAP) provides a mechanism for granting qualified new DOE (and Department of the Navy, via a Memorandum of Understanding) employees and contractors interim “Q” access authorizations while the required Single Scope Background Investigations are completed.

In FY 2007, 4 FTEs will be transferred to the National Nuclear Safety Administration for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Continuity of Operations activities. Salaries and benefit estimates are based on the economic assumptions provided by the Office of Management and Budget. Funding for full-timepermanent employees includes salaries and other personnel benefits, such as cash incentive awards, lump sum payments, Senior Executive Service and other performance awards, and worker’s compensation, and provides for the skills and expertise required to carry out the mission of SSA. Federal employees (40 FTEs) are also located at NBL in Argonne, IL. NBL serves as the central authority for nuclear material safeguards measurements and measurement evaluations and is the U.S. Government’s certifying authority for nuclear reference materials. NBL provides certified reference materials and maintains accurate standards and comprehensive procedures to ensure DOE’s nuclear materials accounts are based on defensible measured values; reducing costs associated with investigating discrepancies and supporting treaty compliance. NBL personnel support DOE and other U.S. Government Agencies and Departments in global nonproliferation efforts by participating in the

An A-76Competitive Sourcing study of NBL was initiated in FY 2005. The results of the study will be announced in March 2006. Federal personnel at Headquarters (268 FTEs) perform the independent oversight mission, support the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board liaison functions, and serve as the operational element for security policy, technology deployment, executive protection, and Headquarters security. Activities include the security training mission at the National Training Center in Albuquerque, NM; plutonium, uranium, and special material control and accountability; classification and declassification operations; tracking of foreign national visits, assignments and travel; Headquarters security operations; executive protection operations; security investigations; Department-wide security policy, to include the development and issuance of security directives for the Department; and DOE Continuity of Government programs. Staff members also serve on interagency working groups and task forces in the development of U.S. Government-wide security policy in the form of Executive Orders, National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Decisions, Directives, and other policy issuances. Travel ................................................................................... 2,567 2,433 2,688 Travel includes all costs of transportation, subsistence, and incidental travel expenses incurred by SSA Federal employees in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations. SSA domestic and foreign trips are necessary to conduct essential security activities. These activities include national security assistance, and interface with field offices, laboratories, and local, state, and foreign governments. Additionally, extensive travel is required for SSA personnel to perform executive protection activities for the Secretary, and other dignitaries as assigned, and to accomplish the independent oversight mission, conducting evaluations across the DOE complex. Support Services ................................................................. 18,745 18,671 18,611 SSA has analyzed its use of support services and has established specific criteria for its efficient use. While SSA has some unique national-level experts, technical contractual services continue to be more practical and cost-effective. The evolving need for national-level expertise in a multitude of disciplines can best be met through the use of contractors who can rapidly respond to the continually changing skill mix required to perform security and independent oversight activities across the DOE complex.Contractor support provides a practical and cost-effective method of providing a surge pool of personnel with technical expertise in a wide range of safety and security disciplines. Support services are utilized as follows. /squarecentSecurity Activities ......................................................... 6,012 5,530 4,365 Security support services utilize highly specialized technical and analytical expertise and management support personnel essential to its mission success. In support of the overall DOE security mission of protecting the U.S. nuclear deterrence capabilities from a spectrum of diverse threats, this activity develops and promulgates clear and consistent security strategies and policy governing the protection of national security and other critical assets entrusted to the Department.

Other Defense Activities/ Security and Safety Performance Assurance/Program Direction FY 2007 Congressional Budget(dollars in thousands) FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Mission areas include: 1) nuclear safeguards and security, which includes the National Training Center, nuclear materials accountability, information security, Headquarters security, specialized security support, foreign visits, assignments and travel, security policy, and classification / declassification; 2) security investigations; and 3) program-specific staffing resources to support the protection of Headquarters assets. /squarecentIndependent Oversight Activities ................................ 12,116 12,575 13,596 Independent oversight activities of security, cyber security, emergency management, and environment, safety, and health programs throughout the Department directly relate to DOE national security strategic and general goals. Independent oversight appraisals are conducted to verify that the Department’s security interests are protected, that the Department can effectively respond to emergencies, and that site workers, the public, and the environment are protected from hazardous operations and materials. These appraisals provide accurate, comprehensive information and analysis regarding the effectiveness, vulnerabilities, and trends of the Department’s security; cyber security; emergency management; environment, safety, and health programs; and other critical functions of interest to the Department Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, the Under Secretary, the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, Congressional committees, and othe r stakeholders, such as the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. As required by DOE Order 470.2B, Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance Program , dated October 21, 2002, the independent appraisal function is performed by personnel organizationally independent of the DOE offices that develop and implement policies and programs and, therefore, can objectively observe and report on these policies and programs as they relate to departmental operations. These appraisals complement but do not replace DOE line management’s responsibility for security and safety program oversight and self-assessments, as required by integrated security management and integrated safety management systems implemented throughout the Department. The appraisal processes utilized are governed by documented, formal protocols addressing all phases of appraisal activities. These processes are also conducive to changing conditions and the needs of the Department. Additionally, SSA continues to be actively involved in the development of Department-level directives that establish overarching principles for oversight and identify DOE oversight activities that involve assessing Federal and contractor performance. These directives are closely linked to the Department’s response to Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Recommendation 2004-1, Oversight of Complex High-Hazard Nuclear Operations. Funding provides for contracted national-level experts to complement the Federal staff, to implement the appraisal process, which emphasizes performance testing. Appraisal personnel observe operations and conduct performance tests to validate the effectiveness of safety and security programs and policies. Reports are developed documenting the assessment activities conducted, the results of those assessments, and opportunities for improvement or findings. Unclassified appraisal reports and classified appraisal report titles are maintained on the SSA web site in order to share the information throughout the Department. Classified reports are maintained in a document control

The final products of the appraisal process are corrective action plans, as required. The corrective action plans are developed by the programs under review and are reviewed and commented on by SSA staff to ensure proposed corrective actions adequately address findings and other issues; and promote the protection of security interests, workers, the public, and the environment. Events and activities that have an impact on security and safety are proactively evaluated and evaluation methods and procedures are continuously revised and refined to better evaluate the principal elements of the independent oversight program. •Security Appraisals ................................................. 5,849 6,033 6,625 Security appraisals are conducted at DOE (primarily, National Nuclear Security Administration) sites that have significant amounts of special nuclear material, classified information, or other security interests. The scope of the appraisals include: physical protection of special nuclear material, accountability of special nuclear material, protection of classified and sensitive information, personnel security, protective forces, foreign visits and assignments, and protection program management. Performance tests are conducted using weapons simulation systems to perform realistic tactical security engagements between a specially trained composite adversaryforce and the inspected site protection force to assess overall security performance effectiveness (e.g., force-on-force exercises). These reviews have directly contributed to significant reductions in the recurrence of security issues, and effectively support the maintenance of a safe, secure, and reliable weapons stockpile. As a direct result of the experiences and expertise developed, tools and information (e.g., handbooks, videotapes, and lessons learned) have been shared with numerous organizations within the Department. SSA’s current safeguard and security independent oversight activities have been shaped by events over the recent past regarding use and management of controlled removable electronic media, revision to the Design Basis Threat Policy, and advancement of DOE Secretarial initiatives. The effect of these events will be reflected in security independent oversight activities over the next several fiscal years. SSA continues to review implemented procedures and processes for controlling accountable controlled removable electronic media and conducts site visits to assist in developing resource-efficient, sustainable protection strategies to support timely implementation of the revised Design Basis Threat Policy. SSA will conduct more frequent evaluations and testing of sites with significant holdings of special nuclear materials, nuclear weapons, and sensitive information facilities. SSA will also increase the number of force-on-force performance tests from 4 to 5 per year. Training for the Composite Adversarial Team that acts as the opposing force during force-on-force exercises will continue semi- annually. Additionally, SSA will conduct special reviews and analyses to assess the effectiveness of site Design Basis Threat Policy implementation plans. Insights on DOE security program strengths and weaknesses gained as a result of independent oversight activities will be published in lessons learned reports for distribution to security and senior departmental management.

Internal and external network penetration testing is conducted in support of inspection activities in order to fully understand a site’s cyber security protection posture. Penetration testing focuses on identifying network vulnerabilities that could be exploited, evaluating the effectiveness of firewalls, evaluating intrusion detection and system monitoring capabilities, and evaluating other aspects of network security. Cyber security assessments require the maintenance of a state-of-the-art cyber security testing network for external testing and a suite of deployable cyber security testing equipment for internal testing of DOE site networks. Cyber security independent oversight activities also include programmatic reviews to evaluate essential management processes that are critical to an effective cyber security program. These reviews assess the direction and sustainability of the program as well as to identify any underlying causes for weaknesses that are discovered during penetration testing. SSA’s current cyber security independent oversight activities have been shaped by focus on compliance with Federal Information Security Management Act requirements, advancement of DOE Secretarial security initiatives, and protection of DOE information systems against ever increasing threats. The effect of these events will be reflected in cyber security independentoversight activities over the next several fiscal years. SSA is responsible for conducting the annual evaluation of classified information systems security program, as required by Federal Information Security Management Act, for both DOE and the Office of Intelligence. SSA also provides critical input to the DOE Office of Inspector General on the annual evaluation of unclassified information systems security program. There are a number of Federal Information Security Management Act focus areas, such as certification and accreditation, which continue to influence the scope of SSA cyber security inspections. In May 2004, the Secretary announced a series of initiatives to improve DOE security including one initiative focused on SSA cyber security testing activities that mandates an active unannounced penetration testing program for the Department, continuous scanning of the DOE network perimeter, and enhanced testing of DOE classified networks. Finally, SSA continues to focus on protection of DOE information systems across the breadth of the Department to ensure that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of important systems are appropriately protected. This includes cyber security assessments of critical infrastructure, national security, science, environmental protection, and other departmental sites. •Emergency Management Appraisals .................... 800 800 800 Appraisals of critical emergency management operations are conducted at DOE Headquarters and DOE field sites having significant amounts of special nuclear material or other hazardous materials and/or operations. These appraisals evaluate the effectiveness of all aspects of emergency management programs, including hazards assessment, protective actions, emergency

Other Defense Activities/ Security and Safety Performance Assurance/Program Direction FY 2007 Congressional Budget(dollars in thousands) FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 response, emergency public information, and offsite interfaces by conducting limited scope performance tests and evaluating full-participation exercises at the inspected sites. Additionally, reviews of crosscutting emergency management topics of increased concern in the heightened terrorist threat environment are performed. Appraisal results have significantly contributed to improvements in emergency management readiness and response at individual sites, within program and field offices, and across the DOE complex. Independent oversight of departmental emergency management program activities has been expanding to include a broader spectrum of reviews in consideration of the post 9/11 threat environment and the implications of the revised Design Basis Threat Policy. At the site implementation level, new emergency management reviews will be conducted jointly with security force-on-force evaluations to test integrated incident command in response to malevolent acts, including response to the release of hazardous materials. Joint reviews of siteenvironment, safety, and health programs will also be conducted to ensure they effectively support emergency response. Cross-cutting special reviews will be expanded to evaluate capabilities required to meet the new directives for the National Response Plan and the National Incident Management System. New reviews will be conducted to assess the Department’s national response assets capabilities in support of potential or actual radiological materials releases. In partnership with line program management, lessons learned site visits will be conducted to share knowledge of effective program implementation practices, and to share independent oversight feedback to the Emergency Operations Training Academy to foster corporate-wide improvement. •Environment, Safety and Health Appraisals ........ 4,000 4,000 4,000 Environment, safety, and health (ES&H) evaluations focus on Integrated Safety Management implementation; ES&H performance; and relevant ES&H topics such as radiation protection, criticality safety, industrial hygiene, and occupational medicine. Integrated Safety Management reviews focus on management systems such as self-assessments, lessons learned, deficiency tracking, root cause analysis, and reporting of compliance deficiencies and events. Periodic independent oversight is also performed of ES&H performance during all phases of major projects, such as construction, recovery, and stabilization of hazardous materials, decommissioning, and environmental restoration. Environmental portions of inspections provideindependent evaluations of a wide variety of environmental protection and restoration activities, including the effectiveness of environmental programs in accordance with Executive Orders. Reviews are conducted of selected areas of current interest (i.e., focus areas), such as compliance with the implementation of environmental management systems, corrective action management, and safety system oversight. Also, reviews are conducted of selected essential systems to ensure that they can perform their safety functions. As a result, these evaluations provide a significant benefit to the Department by improving safety and promoting adherence to applicable Federal and State regulations and DOE and industry standards in such areas as safety and health, radiation protection, waste management, and fire protection. ES&H evaluations have evolved over the past several years to focus on persistent

--- Page 62 ---
Other Defense Activities/ Security and Safety Performance Assurance/Program Direction FY 2007 Congressional Budget(dollars in thousands) FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 implementation problems within DOE. This process has proven to be an effective diagnostic tool to quickly and efficiently identify weaknesses in Integrated Safety Management, and provides a means to ensure timely and effective corrective actions are implemented. SSA currently performs 6 ES&H evaluations each year, focusing on high hazard nuclear, and non- nuclear radiological and industrial facilities. The goal is to perform an evaluation at each of these facilities every 2 to 3 years. Lower hazard facilities will be evaluated as resources permit or events dictate. Sites with recurring weaknesses, high rates of accidents and injuries, or other special considerations may be reviewed more frequently. In addition to the safety evaluations, SSA will conduct more focused reviews of special topic areas, such as safety system oversight,lockout-tagout, chronic beryllium disease prevention, and environmental management. These reviews may be conducted separately or incorporated into ES&H evaluations. Results from ES&H evaluations and focused reviews will be summarized annually in a lessons learned report to safety and senior Department managers. In addition, special investigations maybe conducted to address as directed by the Secretary in important areas such as worker safety and health. •Special Reviews ....................................................... 500 500 500 Special reviews and studies are performed of policies, programs, and their implementation in the field to identify program corrections. These special reviews are often conducted in addition to regularly scheduled appraisal activities at the request of the Secretary and other senior departmental managers to examine issues derived from current events, e.g., the recent departmental stand-down of all operations involving accountable classified removable electronic media; and implementation of the revised Design Basis Threat Policy. In addition, special review activities include reviews of issues not normally covered by ongoing independent oversight functions (i.e., security, cyber security, emergency management, and ES&H), e.g., Investigation of Worker Exposures and Medical Services at the Hanford Site and River Protection Project; and Limited Scope Small Business Review. Finally, special reviews of crosscutting subjects, such as protective force, lock and key control, internet connectivity, chemical / biological agent use, and hoisting and rigging programs, are developed from site-specific investigations to provide DOE senior management an overview of programs and associated issues across the entire Department. The results of these special reviews and studies have been of particular interest to senior DOE managers and Congress, and their evaluation and analysis has resulted in substantial improvements to programs throughout DOE. /squarecentDefense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Liaison Activities ........................................................................ 617 566 650 Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) liaison activities are reported directly to the Deputy Secretary via the Office of the Departmental Representative to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DR), with administrative support provided by SSA.

DOE-STD-3020-97, Specifications for HEPA Filters Used by DOE Contractors , requires that each filter be test ed by both the manufacturer and FTF. Information Management is a critical component of corporate safety programs. The program manages and directs defense-related infor mation activities to maximize the sharing and efficient use of data and information to meet the requirements of Federal regulations and legislation as well as the President’s Management Agenda (PMA) initiative “Expanded Electronic Government”. This program provides both web pages and web-based database systems including access to the EH Corporate Reporting Systems (Occurrence Reporting and Processing System and the Computerized Accident and Illness Systems) as well as mission-specific systems. These systems will be re-engineered for efficiency by consolidating existing databases and utilizing the latest techno logical capabilities to distribute information, including health studies communications management capability and web-based health studies status. Further enhancement of the EH website with portal and workflow tools will enable EH to adhere to new OMB guidelines on Federal Website Administration and to support the newly-established Federal Health Line of Business. To address immediate ES&H issues in the Department, the Facility Safety Program performs evaluations including accident investigations, facility author izations bases, and safety allegations. Special safety reviews are conducted for nuclear hazards, criticality safety, seismic analysis, fire protection, occupational and construction safety, emergency operations, facility design, and the startup and restart of facilities. Safety Basis Corporate Support provides technical support for effective implementation of safety regulations (e.g., 10 CFR 830) for facility design, construction, operation, and decommissioning. Activities includes support of Critical Decision for nuclear facilities under design or major modification; support to RW on design and safety review of Yucca Mountain geological repository project; review of safety bases for nuclear facilities in operation and decommissioning phases including high hazard facilities such as ATR and HFIR; support for review of accident analysis of Environmental Impact Statements; evaluation of Unreviewed Safety Questions, and publication of lessons learned reports; and other studies or reviews as requested. EH conducts Type A investigations for the more serious incidents occurring within the DOE Complex, and reviews Type B investigation reports for investigations conducted by line program elements for less serious incidents. Inconsistencies observed in Type B investigations have highlighted the need for the office to conduct independent programmatic oversight during selected Type B Accident Investigations

Readiness Reviews are conducted at Category 1, 2, and 3 nuclear facilities prior to authorizing the startup or restart of those facilities. As the Office of Primary Interest for the Readiness Review process, EH and the DNFSB staff have identified inconsistencies and deficiencies in process implementation across the complex. Consequently, additional efforts will be focused on these areas before they result in a major site incident or become the basis for a new DNFSB Recommendation. Based on current line program projections, the office will participate as team members or in Independent Reviews during a number of ORRs/RAs, will sponsor ORR Team Member/Team Leader training sessions, and will provide technical support to line program management. The office will also draft revision “D” of DOE Order 425.1C and associated Standard 3006-2000. The Office of Facility Authorization Bases serves as the Dam Safety Coordinator for DOE. Under the provisions of a Memorandum of Agreement between DOE and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the FERC inspectors provide safety inspections of dams and other water impoundment structures owned by DOE across the DOE complex. The EH Enforcement program carries out the statutory mandate of the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 to enforce compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations for nuclear safety requirements at DOE sites and enforcement of worker safety. Corporate Safety Programs also includes funding for the Department of Energy Laboratory Accreditation Program and the Analytical Services Program (run by the Radiological and Environmental Sciences Laboratory) as follows: Radiological and Environmental Sciences Lab............. 4,174 4,132 2,450 The Radiological and Environmental Sciences Laboratory (RESL) is DOE’s Federal reference laboratory that conducts performance evaluation and accreditation activities, provides technical support and measurement, and quality assurance methodologies to programs such as the DOE Laboratory Accreditation Program, and the Mixed Analyte Performance Evaluation Program. These programs act as insurance policies against potential radiation exposure or D&D litigation or future worker compensation programs. The responsibility to operate RESL was transferred from EM to EH in FY 2004. Analytical Services Program.......................................... 1,309 1,296 1,188 The Analytical Services Program ensures that environmental analytical laboratory data is of high quality and reliability and assures that analytical data is technically and legally defensible. The program implements DOE’s Consolidated Audit Program thereby reducing redundant field audits of commercial analytical laboratories and Treatment, Storage & Disposal Facilities, resulting in significant cost savings for the Government.

Marshall Islands.............................................................. 6,000 6,000 6,000 This request funds Public Laws 99-239 and 108-188, the Compact of Free Association between the U.S. and Republic of the Marshall Islands. The Health program also includes a special medical care program for a small cohort of radiation–exposed individuals in the Marshall Islands and supports field science and radiological monitoring to assist decision-making on the resettlement of the displaced Atoll populations. In FY 2006 and FY 2007, the medical program will continue to provide annual examinations and cancer care, under the auspices of a new medical care provider, using a more cost effective approach; several major environmental missions to Bikini, Enewetak, and Rongelap Atolls will collect samples to assist atolls in resettlement decision-making. In FY 2007, there will be an advance contingent of resettled persons (around 150-200) at Rongelap Atoll and DOE’s program will provide whole-body counting and plutonium analyses for this population. Whole-body technologies will continue to be the centerpiece of the DOE’s environmental/radiological monitoring program at Majuro, Enewetak, & Rongelap. Other Health Programs.................................................. 34,841 25,989 20,772 Other Health Activities include the Former Worker Program, the Worker and Community Public Health Program, the Illness and Injury Surveillance program, International Health Studies program, and funding for the Radiation Emergency Accident Center/Training Site. Occupational Health................................................. 12,500 13,056 12,363 The Former Worker Program supports the Office of Health Studies’ mission and strategic response by offering specialized medical screening by external teams of health experts to former workers who may have been exposed to hazardous materials as a result of their work at DOE sites. Participants with significant findings are referred to their personal physicians for further attention, thus promoting early detection and intervention of occupational illnesses, and in some cases, submission of workers compensation claims under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA). In FY 2006, the Former Workers Program continued an expansion of services initiated in FY 2005 to workers not already covered by the original medical screening projects through a combination of new regional projects and a new national supplemental care screening program. In FY 2007, DOE will have implemented program enhancements within this congressionally mandated program to ensure the best and most cost-effective service to the largest number of former workers. The Radiation Emergency Accident Center/Training Site (REAC/TS) maintains the capability to provide rapid response medical expertise and training to address radiological accidents. In FY 2006, REAC/TS reinstitutes the capability to conduct cytogenetic studies to be able to quickly and accurately determine an individual’s radiation dose in the event of a radiological or dirty bomb event. In FY 2007, it is expected that REAC/TS will be certified as a reference cytogenetic biodosimetry laboratory and organize, provide training and quality assurance for a national consortium of clinical laboratories that will be able to provide analyses in the event of a radiological/nuclear incident.

These activities are conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) through three interagency agreements. In FY 2006, NIOSH communicated results to workers concerning four studies at five DOE sites. Study results provide information that is designed to enhance the understanding of risks associated with radiation-induced health effects to over 800,000 workers. In FY 2006, NCEH concluded an historical environmental dose reconstruction at one of DOE’s major production sites that evaluated the risk to the public of past releases of radiation and chemicals in communities around DOE sites. Results of historical dose reconstructions are used to estimate exposure-related health risks. In FY 2006, ATSDR finalized seven out of eight public health assessments of the Oak Ridge Reservation.In FY 2007, NIOSH will complete a worker mortality study at Fernald, as well as a study that identifies and describes potential external and internal radiation exposures in plutonium workers at two DOE sites. NCEH will complete a record review of Los Alamos National Laboratory, the last major DOE production site, to determine if an environmental dose reconstruction is warranted; and ATSDR will publish final Public Health Assessments for the Savannah River Site and the Oak Ridge facilities. Epidemiological Studies............................................ 3,100 3,057 3,056 Epidemiologic Studies collect both health and exposure data to document and demonstrate effects of radiation and other hazards to current DOE workers and the public and to validate current Departmental protection policies. The Illness and Injury Surveillance Program (IISP) evaluates potential health impacts of DOE operations on workers by monitoring the health of current contractor workers at 14 participating DOE sites. In FY 2007, capabilities to more rapidly perform disease outbreak investigations will be enhanced for quicker identification of health concerns in need of immediate attention. The Comprehensive Epidemiologic Data Resource (CEDR) is an electronic data base which allows investigators access to data from studies funded by DOE. The U.S. Uranium and Transuranium Registries (USTUR) provides independent, continuous improvement in DOE’s ability to estimate internal doses attributable to intake of long-lived radioactive materials by studying the distribution and possible biological effects of plutonium and other heavy metals in voluntarily donated human tissues. In FY 2006, USTUR will use its data to refine dosimetry models to account for wounds and effects of chelation therapy. In FY 2007, criteria for standardization of bioassay and health physics databases will be developed for in ternational use. The viability of stored USTUR tissue will be assessed for possible use in cellular/genetic studies. International Health Studies.................................... 3,300 3,255 3,255 The Russian Health Studies Program was developed to assess worker and public health risks from radiation exposure resulting from nuclear weapons production activities in the former Soviet Union. Presently, DOE supports radiation dose reconstruction studies, epidemiologic studies, molecular and radiobiological studies, a tissue repository, and data preservation and integration activities. In FY 2006, researchers will publish cancer risk estimates for Mayak workers and for the residents of

Thus, the “goal cascade” is the following: Department Mission ĺ Strategic Goal (25 yrs) ĺ General Goal (10-15 yrs) ĺ Program Goal (GPRA Unit) (10-15 yrs) To provide a concrete link between budget, performance, and reporting, the Department developed a “GPRA Unit” concept. Within DOE, a GPRA Unit defines a major activity or group of activities that support the core mission and aligns resources with specific goals. Each GPRA Unit has completed or will complete a Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART). A unique program goal was developed for each GPRA Unit. A numbering scheme has been established for tracking performance and reporting. The goal cascade accomplishes two things. First, it ties major activities for each program to successive goals and, ultimately, to DOE’s mission. This helps ensure the Department focuses its resources on fulfilling its mission. Second, the cascade allows DOE to track progress against quantifiable goals and to tie resources to each goal at any level in the cascade. Thus, the cascade facilitates the integration of budget and performance information in support of the GRPA and the President’s Management Agenda (PMA). Mission The mission of the Office of Legacy Management is to manage the department’s post-closure responsibilities and ensure the future protection of human health and the environment. This Office has control and custody for legacy lands, structures, and facilities and is responsible for maintaining them at levels suitable for their long-term use. Benefits The greatest benefit of the Office of Legacy Management is to serve as a visible demonstration of the Department’s resolve to honor its responsibilities for the communities near its remediated facilities and for the former contractor work force. The Office of Legacy Management programs provide benefits to the Department following mission change or site closure. For sites where cleanup is completed, Legacy Management programs ensure that the remediation measures implemented during closure are protecting human health and the environment, that labor responsibilities for the contractor work force are being satisfied, and that other Departmental legacy responsibilities are met. By managing the real and personal property assets that remain after cleanup and closure, Legacy Management helps the Department reduce the magnitude of its physical resource management, the costs associated with such management, and actively promotes the beneficial reuse of those mission excess properties. Strategic, General, and Program Goals The Department’s Strategic Plan identifies four strategic goals (one each for defense, energy, science, and environmental aspects of the mission plus seven general goals that tie to the strategic goals. The Other Defense Activities appropriation supports the following goal: Environment Strategic Goal: To protect the environment by providing a responsible resolution to the environmental legacy of the Cold War and by providing for the permanent disposal of high-level radioactive waste.

Other Defense Activities/ Legacy Management/ Overview FY 2007 Congressional BudgetGeneral Goal 6, Environmental Management: Accelerate cleanup of nuclear weapons manufacturing and testing sites, completing cleanup of 108 contaminated sites by 2025. The programs funded within the Other Defense Activities appropriation have one Program Goal that contributes to the General Goal in the “goal cascade”. This goal is: Program Goal 06.26.00.00: Legacy Management – By 2015, the Office of legacy Management will be responsible for: the cost effective management of land, structures, facilities and/or records for over 120 sites; employee benefits for the Department’s former contractor work force at seven sites; and the disposal of real property at five sites. Contribution to General Goal Within the Program Goal for the Legacy Management program, there are four subgoals that contribute to the general goal. These subgoals are: Protect human health and the environment through effective and efficient long-term surveillance and maintenance – Activities associated with this subgoal contribute to the general goal by managing the long-term surveillance and maintenance at sites where remediation has been essentially completed, allowing the Environmental Management program to concentrate its efforts on continuing to accelerate cleanup and site closure resulting in reduced risks to human health and the environment and reduced landlord costs. Preserve, protect, and make accessible legacy records and information – These activities assist the other activities by providing a central records management capability. This work directly supports the administration of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) and is responsive to Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act requests. This enables more efficient operation of the other activities and is needed to defend the Department against future liability claims. Support an effective and efficient work force structured to accomplish Departmental missions and assure contractor worker pension and medical benefits – The Legacy Management program manages the Department’s labor relations and oversees some pension and benefit programs to meet the Department’s contractual commitments. By managing these activities, the Office of Legacy Management enables the Office of Environmental Management to focus on further risk reduction by remediating other sites. Manage legacy land and assets, emphasizing protective real and personal property reuse and disposition – These activities promote more efficient management of remediated resources. This allows more resources to be focused on further risk reduction.

Other Defense Activities/ Legacy Management/ Overview FY 2007 Congressional BudgetMeans and Strategies The Legacy Management Program will use various means and strategies to achieve its program goal. However, various external factors may impact the ability to achieve the goal. The program also performs collaborative activities to help meet its goal. The Department will implement the following means: Long-term surveillance and maintenance will be performed in accordance with the regulatory decisions for each site. Activities range from maintaining records to routine inspections and maintenance at sites where remediation measures are substantially completed. Adequate staffing will be maintained to oversee the program. A large portion of the surveillance and maintenance and payment of the contractor pensions and benefits will be performed by contractors. The Department will implement the following strategies: The Office of Legacy Management (LM) will only accept responsibility for sites where remediation has been substantially completed. The following external factors could affect LM’s ability to achieve its strategic goal: Significant changes in remedy performance could cause the site to be returned to EM for further remediation. In conducting the program’s surveillance and maintenance functions, LM performs the following collaborative activities: Evaluation of remedy performance, as determined by surveillance and maintenance activities, is coordinated with regulators, local communities, and other stakeholders. Validation and Verification The Department is operating a performance tracking system to measure performance. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer has developed action plans for the primary functions. Quarterly updates for sites where surveillance and maintenance has been conducted are reported using an automated system. For payments of medical benefits or other activities not tracked by the automated system, the Office of Legacy Management will obtain quarterly updates to judge progress of the programs. The Legacy Management program has not performed a Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) evaluation to date but such a review and the measures resulting from it would also provide verification. The observed results of surveillance and maintenance activities will be documented as annual inspection and compliance reports and retained as long as specified in Federal requirements for records retention. To validate and verify program performance, LM will conduct various internal and external reviews and audits. LM’s programmatic activities are subject to continuing reviews by the Congress, the

Other Defense Activities/ Legacy Management/ Overview FY 2007 Congressional BudgetGovernment Accountability Office, the Department’s Inspector General, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, state environmental and health agencies, and the Department’s Office of Engineering and Construction Management. Additionally, LM Headquarters senior management staff conduct quarterly, in-depth reviews of cost, schedule, and scope to ensure projects are on-track and within budget. Significant Policy or Program Shifts By the start of FY 2007, the Office of Environmental Management (EM) will have completed active cleanup of several major sites throughout the Department of Energy complex. Management of these sites will be transferred to the Office of Legacy Management (LM). Management activities will include legacy functions of long-term surveillance and maintenance, long-term response actions, oversight and management of pension and benefit payments for former contractor retirees, and records management. The cumulative effect of these transfers will result in an increase of the LM budget by approximately 150 percent. However, this increase in the LM budget will be matched by a corresponding decrease in the EM budget. - The largest transfer will be for the Rocky Flats site near Denver, CO. Active cleanup will be completed and all other activities except for legacy function at this major site have ended. At this site, LM will be managing all activities identified above. - The Fernald Site near Cincinnati, OH, is another major transfer. Like Rocky Flats, active cleanup will be completed and LM will be managing all the legacy functions identified above. - A group of sites known collectively as the Nevada offsites, will be also be a major transfer. The sites involved in this category are: Amchitka site, AK; Rio Blanco and Rulison sites, CO; Gasbuggy and Gnome-Coach sites, NM; Salmon site, MS; and Project Shoal and Central Nevada Test Area, NV. LM will be managing the legacy functions of long-term surveillance and management, long-term response actions, and records management for these sites. There are no pension or benefit payments involved for any of these sites. At the same time that the program magnitude is significantly increasing, the Office of Legacy Management (LM) is involved in an internal evaluation of its own management needs. LM is evaluating the anticipated work load from the increased activities and its existing skill mix in an effort to effectively manage its activities. So far, this review has resulted in significant efficiencies for FY 2007 from FY 2006, despite the increase in the program scope and magnitude. To accommodate the records management functions, the FY 2007 request supports the centralization of Legacy Archives and Information activities from various sites across the country to a single location to ensure a more streamlined management approach.

Other Defense Activities/Nuclear Energy/ Overview FY 2007 Co ngressional Budget Preface The Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE) leads the Government’s efforts to develop new nuclear energy generation technologies to meet energy and climate goals, to develop advanced, proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel technologies that maximize energy from nuclear fuel, and to maintain and enhance the national nuclear technology infrastructure. NE serves the present and future energy needs of the Nation by managing the safe operation and maintenance of the DOE critical nuclear infrastructure that provides nuclear technology goods and services. NE has one program completely funded within the Other Defense Activities appropriation - Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and Security. In FY 2005 and FY 2006, NE has two programs that are partially funded within the Other Defense Activities appropriation - Idaho Facilities Management and Program Direction. Beginning in FY 2007 funds for these programs are solely requested in the Energy Supply and Conservation appropriation. This Overview will describe Strategic Context, Mission, Benefits, Strategic Goals and Funding by General Goal. These items together put the appropriation in perspective. The Annual Performance Results and Targets, Means and Strategies, and Validation and Verification sections address how the goals will be achieved and how performance will be measured. Strategic Context Following publication of the Administration’s “National Energy Policy”, the Department developed a Strategic Plan that defines its mission, four strategic goals for accomplishing that mission, and seven general goals to support the strategic goals. Each appropriation has developed quantifiable goals to support the general goals. Thus, the “goal cascade” is the following: Department Mission o Strategic Goal (25 yrs) o General Goal (10-15 yrs) o Program Goal (GPRA Unit) (10-15 yrs) To provide a concrete link between budget, performance, and reporting, the Department developed a “GPRA a unit” concept. Within DOE, a GPRA unit defines a major activity or group of activities that support the core mission and aligns resources with specific goals. Each GPRA unit has completed or will complete a Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART). A unique program goal was developed for each GPRA unit. A numbering scheme has been established for tracking performance and reporting.b The goal cascade accomplishes two things. First, it ties major activities for each program to successive goals and, ultimately, to DOE’s mission. This helps ensure the Department focuses its resources on fulfilling its mission. Second, the cascade allows DOE to track progress against quantifiable goals and to tie resources to each goal at any level in the cascade. Thus, the cascade facilitates the integration of budget and performance information in support of the GPRA and the President’s Management Agenda (PMA). a Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 b The numbering scheme uses the following numbering convention: Fi rst two digits identify the Gen eral Goal (01 through 07); second two digits identify the GPRA Un it; last four digits are reserved for future use.

Other Defense Activities/Nuclear Energy/ Infrastructure FY 2007 Congressional Budget Means and Strategies NE will use various means and strategies to achieve its program goals. However, various external factors may impact the ability to achieve these goals. NE also performs collaborative activities to help meet its goals. The Department will implement the following means: Continue planning activities to implement the 2005 Design Basis Threat (DBT) Policy to ensure appropriate protective measures are taken commensurate with risk and consequence. The Department will implement the following strategies: Provide physical protection and maintain operational security systems. Implement personnel identity verification and diskless workstation systems and conduct semi-annual and annual program reviews. The following external factors could affect NE’s ability to achieve its strategic goal: Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and Security Key External Factors: Annual review of the Design Basis Threat (DBT) policy, which is based on current inte lligence information and threat assessment, could result in significant changes in DBT requirements. This could affect NE’s ability to achieve goals on schedule. In addition, significant change in National Security Condition (SECON) level in response to a national security event would require re-prioritization of resources that could impact DBT implementation schedule. Finally, acquisition and testing of developmental high technology security systems have the potential to reduce the number of protective forces personnel, however, these systems have not been tested in a DOE laboratory environment. Validation and Verification To validate and verify program performance, NE will conduct various internal and external reviews and audits. NE’s programmatic activities are subject to continuing review by the Congress, the General Accountability Office, the Department’s Inspector General, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental and health agencies, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, and the Department’s Office of Engineering and Construction Management (including DOE Real Property Management Order). In addition, NE provides continual management and oversight of its vital field infrastructure programs. Periodic internal and external program reviews evaluate progress against established plans. These reviews provide an opportunity to verify and validate performance. Monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual reviews, consistent with program management plans, are held to ensure technical progress, cost and schedule adherence, and responsiveness to program requirements. NERAC subcommittees evaluate progress of NE’s research and development programs. NERAC similarly reviews specific program plans as they are being formulated. In early FY 2004, NERAC established a Subcommittee on Evaluations. The full NERAC and its subcommittees have provided independent evaluations in the past, but these evaluations never comprehensively covered the entire nuclear energy program. The new Subcommittee engages appropriate experts to monitor, on a continual basis designated NE programs and evaluate the progress of these programs against (a) direction and guidance provided by the full NERAC and (b) program plans and performance measures developed by

Other Defense Activities/Nuclear Energy/ Infrastructure/ Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and Security FY 2007 Congressional Budget Benefits This program is designed to support DOE’s Defense Strategic Goal to protect our national security. The Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and Security program provides protection of nuclear materials, classified matter, Government property, and other vital assets from unauthorized access, theft, diversion, sabotage, espionage, and other hostile acts that may cause risks to national security, the health and safety of DOE and contractor employees, the public or the environment. DOE will fully implement the 2003 Design Basis Threat (DBT) in FY 2006 by completing physical upgrades and reducing Category I facilities at INL to two co-located Category I facilities protected by a single Perimeter Intrusion Detection and Assessment System (PIDAS). Implementation is in accordance with the approved resource-loaded Idaho Site DBT Implementation Plan. DOE will continue planning activities toward implementation of the 2005 DBT policy requirements using a risk-informed approach to physical upgrades. Both the 2004 and 2005 DBT policy requirements increased the strength of the postulated adversarial threat over the 2003 DBT; although detailed vulnerability assessments have not yet been completed, significant security system physical upgrades are expected. DOE’s Office of Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance conducted a site assistance visit at Idaho to identify opportunities to increase security in a more cost effective manner through better integration of highly advanced security technology with site security operations. Pending the completion of vulnerability assessments, which will guide protection strategy, DOE believes that early investment in improved positions for defending forces, more capable detection systems, and technological deterrent devices at target locations will result in cost avoidance over the lifetime by relying more on technology and tactics than additional protective force members to counter the revised threat. DOE will also implement Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201, entitled Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors. FIPS 201 was developed to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-12. The new standard requires improving identity and authentication of Federal employees and contractors accessing Federal facilities and information systems. DOE would like to begin the transition to a diskless classified computing environment in FY 2007. This initiative would be funded by user programs.

Many of these programs seek to balance the interests of different and sometimes competing stakeholders. The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) provides legal adjudicatory services for the Department’s programs so that these conflicting interests may be decided in a fair, impartial and efficient manner. Within the Other Defense Activities Appropriation, OHA operates with three principal legal staffs – the Office of Legal Analysis, the Office of Financial Analysis and the Office of Economic Analysis. This Overview will describe Strategic Context, Mission, and Benefits. These items together put this Appropriation in perspective. Strategic Context Following publication of the Administration’s National Energy Policy, the Department developed a Strategic Plan that defines the mission, four strategic goals for accomplishing that mission, and seven general goals to support the strategic goals. As stated in the Departmental Strategic Plan, DOE’s Strategic and General Goals will be accomplished not only through the efforts of the major program offices in the Department but with additional effort from offices which support the programs in carrying out the mission. OHA performs critical functions which directly support the mission of the Department. These functions include ensuring, through its role in conducting hearings in Personnel Security cases, that only trustworthy employees are allowed access to classified information or controlled nuclear materials. Likewise, in its supervision of Whistleblower hearings, OHA insures that the Department has a workplace where employee concerns about health and safety, fraud, waste, abuse or mismanagement may be freely expressed to DOE or contractor management without fear of retaliation. OHA’s role in deciding Appeals and Applications for Exceptions supports the Department in ensuring that relevant regulations and statutes are applied properly and without undue disruption to the private sector. This directly benefits the public and reduces the Department’s litigation costs in Federal courts. a Reflects a 1% rescission in accor dance with P.L. 109-148, Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006.

Other Defense Activities/ Hearings and Appeals/ Overview 2007 Congressional Budget Mission OHA’s mission is to conduct fair and efficient hearings and to issue decisions of the Department with respect to any adjudicative proceedings that the Secretary may delegate. OHA’s jurisdiction includes, for example, security clearance hearings, hearings of complaints filed under the DOE Contractor Employee Protection Program as well as appeals requesting review of any determination reached by any official within the Department under OHA’s jurisdiction. As stated in the Departmental Strategic Plan, DOE’s Strategic and General Goals will be accomplished not only through the efforts of the major program offices in the Department but with additional effort from offices which support the programs in carrying out the mission of the Department. OHA performs critical functions which directly support the mission. These functions include ensuring, through its role in conducting hearings in Personnel Security cases, that only trustworthy employees are allowed access to classified information or controlled nuclear materials. Likewise, in its supervision of Whistleblower hearings, OHA insures that the Department has a workplace where employee concerns about health and safety, fraud, waste, abuse or mismanagement may be freely expressed to DOE or contractor management without fear of retaliation. OHA’s role in deciding Appeals and Applications for Exceptions supports the Department in ensuring that relevant regulations and statutes are applied properly and without undue disruption to the private sector. This directly benefits the public and reduces the Department’s litigation costs in Federal courts. Benefits In its adjudicatory mission for the Department, OHA offers a fair, impartial and customer-friendly process in which firms and individuals may seek review of agency actions. OHA is also charged with conducting hearings in Personnel Security cases. OHA issues timely, high quality decisions in cases involving DOE personnel security clearance adjudications that ensure only trustworthy personnel are allowed access to classified information and special nuclear materials. Thus, OHA directly supports the Department’s Defense Strategic Goal of helping ensure the security of the nuclear weapons stockpile. OHA also conducts investigations and hearings concerning whistleblower complaints filed by DOE contractor employees and for issuing final agency decisions resolving them. In these cases, OHA strives to balance the public interest in promoting a workplace where concerns may be freely expressed without retaliation against the need of DOE contractors to manage their resources efficiently. This is especially important with regard to the Department’s Environmental Strategic Goal to ensure that cleanup of the environmental legacy of the Cold War is effectively performed. OHA also analyzes and decides appeals requesting review of any determination reached by any other official within the Department under the jurisdiction of the Secretary, including initial determinations under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the payments-equal-to-taxes (PETT) provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the special assessment provisions for the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the reimbursement of costs of remedial actions at active uranium or thorium processing sites under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. OHA is responsible for deciding Applications for Exception from the generally applicable requirements of a rule, regulation or order of the Department. The Office also analyzes Petitions for Special Redress seeking "extraordinary relief" apart from or in addition to any other remedy provided in the Department's enabling statutes.

Other Defense Activities/Security Safeguards and Security Crosscut FY 2007 Congressio nal Budget Safeguards and Security Program Mission The mission of the Safeguards and Security (S&S) program at each Department of Energy (DOE) site is to protect DOE interests from theft, diversion, sabotage, espionage, unauthorized access, compromise, and other hostile acts which may cause unacceptable adverse impacts on national security, program continuity, the health and safety of employees, the public or the environment. This section of the budget provides summary budget estimates of the Department’s S&S programs. Details of the individual S&S programs and their budgets are found in the following program budget justifications: xNational Nuclear Security Administration xEnvironmental Management xSecurity and Safety Performance Assurance xInformation Management xScience xNuclear Energy Program Overview The budget for the Department’s direct funded S&S programs is organized to ensure consistency in program and budget execution and ensure adequate management, direction, tracking and monitoring of security costs throughout the Department. Each S&S program budget provides high visibility for S&S issues and helps the Department prioritize functions for effective and efficient S&S program implementation. Furthermore, the structure of the S&S budgets ensures consistency in budget execution across diverse programs, principally the National Nuclear Security Administration, Environmental Management, Science, and Nuclear Energy. For these Field Security programs, the budget structure takes the form of the following seven program elements: Protective Forces: Provides for the protection of special nuclear materials, information, employees, and government property from theft, diversion, sabotage, and malicious destruction. Security Systems: Addresses access control and interior/exter ior intrusion detection systems. Information Security: Ensures that individuals protect classified matter and sensitive unclassified matter, and establishes protection systems that require degrees of protection for each classification level. Cyber Security: Assures effective and efficient protection of computer and technical resources. Personnel Security: Supports activities associated with the access authorization program.
