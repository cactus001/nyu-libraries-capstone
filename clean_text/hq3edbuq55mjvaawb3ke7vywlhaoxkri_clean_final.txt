CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE June 20, 2008 H.R. 4199 A bill to amend the Dayton Aviation Heritage Preservation Act of 1992 to add sites to the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park As ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on June 11, 2008 SUMMARY H.R. 4199 would add two sites to the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park and would rename the park the Wright Brothers-Dunbar National Historical Park. The bill alsowould authorize the National Park Service (NPS) to make grants to local organizations forconstruction projects on private property within park boundaries. Based on information obtained from NPS and assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4199 would cost $15 million over the2009-2013 period and $1 million annually thereafter for ongoing operations. Enacting thelegislation would not affect direct spending or revenues. H.R. 4199 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandate s as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, ortribal governments. ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT The estimated budgetary impact of H.R. 4199 is shown in the following table. The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 300 (natural resources and environment).

BASIS OF ESTIMATE For this estimate, CBO assumes that the legislation will be enacted by the end of fiscal year 2008 and that the necessary amounts will be a ppropriated for each year. Estimated outlays are based on historical spending patterns for NPS programs. H.R. 4199 would amend the Dayton Aviation Heritage Preservation Act of 1992 to add Hawthorne Hill and the Wright Company Factory to the Dayton Aviation Heritage NationalHistorical Park. Based on information obtained from NPS, CBO expects that the currentowners of Hawthorne Hill and the Wright Company Factory would donate those propertiesto NPS. CBO estimates that site developm ent costs would be $3 million for Hawthorne Hill and $11 million for the Wright Company Factory. The Wright Family Foundation wouldcontinue to operate Hawthorne Hill under a cooperative agreement with NPS, which weestimate would contribute about $1 million for that purpose over the five-year period. Weexpect that the Wright Company Factory would begin operations after 2013, at an annual costof about $1 million. The bill also would authorize NPS to make grants to local partners for development and construction on nonfederal property within the boundaries of the Dayton Aviation HeritageNational Historical Park. Based on information provided by NPS, CBO estimates that thecost of those grants would not be significant. INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE-SECTOR IMPACT H.R. 4199 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.
