11Office of the Secretary, Interior §2.15 U.S. Department of the Interior, Wash- ington, DC 20240. (b) Form of requests. (1) Requests under this subpart shall be in writing and must specifically invoke the Act. (2) A request must reasonably de- scribe the records requested. A request reasonably describes the records re-quested if it will enable an employee of the Department familiar with the sub-ject area of the request to locate the record with a reasonable amount of ef-fort. If such information is available, the request should identify the subject matter of the record, the date when it was made, the place where it was made, the person or office that made it, the present custodian of the record, and any other information that will assist in locating the requested record. If the request involves a matter known by the requester to be in litigation, the re-quest should also state the case name and court hearing the case. (3)(i) A request shall — (A) Specify the fee category (commercial use, news media, edu-cational institution, noncommercial scientific institution, or other) in which the requester claims the request to fall and the basis of this claim (see §2.20(b) through (e) for definitions) and (B) State the maximum amount of fees that the requester is willing to pay or include a request for a fee waiver. (ii) Requesters are advised that, under §2.20 (f) and (g), the time for re- sponding to requests may be delayed — (A) If a requester has not sufficiently identified the fee category applicable to the request, (B) If a requester has not stated a willingness to pay fees as high as an-ticipated by the Department or (C) If a fee waiver request is denied and the requester has not included an alternative statement of willingness to pay fees as high as anticipated by the Department. (4) A request seeking a fee waiver shall, to the extent possible, address why the requester believes that the cri-teria for fee waivers set out in §2.21 are met. (5) To ensure expeditious handling, requests should be prominently marked, both the envelope and on the face of the request, with the legend ‘‘FREEDOM OF INFORMATION RE- QUEST. ’’ (c) Creation of records. A request may seek only records that are in existence at the time the request is received. A request may not seek records that come into existence after the date on which it is received and may not re-quire that new records be created in re-sponse to the request by, for example, combining or compiling selected items from manual files, preparing a new computer program, or calculating pro-portions, percentages, frequency dis-tributions, trends or comparisons. In those instances where the Department determines that creating a new record will be less burdensome than disclosing large volumes of unassembled mate-rial, the Department may, in its discre-tion, agree to creation of a new record as an alternative to disclosing existing records. [52 FR 45586, Nov. 30, 1987, as amended at 67 FR 4368, Jan. 30, 2002] §2.15 Preliminary processing of re- quests. (a) Scope of requests. (1) Unless a re- quest clearly specifies otherwise, re-quests to field installations of a bureau may be presumed to seek only records at that installation and requests to a bureau head or bureau FOIA officer may be presumed to seek only records of that bureau. (2) If a request to a field installation of a bureau specifies that it seeks records located at other installations of the same bureau, the installation shall refer the request to the other in-stallation(s) or the bureau FOIA officer for appropriate processing. The time limit provided in §2.17(a) does not start until the request is received at the in-stallation having the records or by the bureau FOIA officer. (3) If a request to a bureau specifies that it seeks records of another bureau, the bureau may return the request (or the relevant portion thereof) to the re-quester with instructions as to how the request may be resubmitted to the other bureau. (b) Intradepartmental consultation and referral. (1) If a bureau (other than the Office of Inspector General) receives a request for records in its possession VerDate 0ct<31>2002 04:19 Nov 23, 2002 Jkt 197172 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\197172T.XXX 197172T

1243 CFR Subtitle A (10 –1–02 Edition) §2.15 that originated with or are of substan- tial concern to another bureau, it shall consult with that bureau before decid-ing whether to release or withhold the records. (2) As an alternative to consultation, a bureau may refer the request (or the relevant protion thereof) to the bureau that originated or is substantially con-cerned with the records. Such referrals shall be made expeditiously and the re-quester shall be notified in writing that a referral has been made. A refer-ral under this paragraph does not re-start the time limit provided in §2.17. (c) Records of other departments and agencies. (1) If a requested record in the possession of the Department of the In-terior originated with another Federal department or agency, the request shall be referred to that agency un- less— (i) The record is of primary interest to the Department, (ii) The Department is in a better po- sition than the originating agency to assess whether the record is exempt from disclosure, or (iii) The originating agency is not subject to the Act. The Department has primary interest in a record if it was developed or pre-pared pursuant to Department regula-tions, directives or request. (2) In accordance with Execuctive Order 12356, a request for documents that were classified by another agency shall be referred to that agency. (d) Consultation with submitters of com- mercial and financial information. (1) If a request seeks a record containing trade secrets or commercial or financial in-formation submitted by a person out-side of the Federal government, the bu-reau processing the request shall pro-vide the submitter with notice of the request whenever — (i) The submitter has made a good faith designation of the information as commercially or financially sensitive, or (ii) The bureau has reason to believe that disclosure of the information may result in commercial or financial in-jury to the submitter. Where notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, such notification may be accomplished by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably calculated to accom- plish notification. (2) The notice to the submitter shall afford the submitter a reasonable pe-riod within which to provide a detailed statement of any objection to disclo-sure. The submitter ’s statement shall explain the basis on which the informa-tion is claimed to be exempt under the FOIA, including a specification of any claim of competitive or other business harm that would result from disclo- sure. The statement shall also include a certification that the information is confidential, has not been disclosed to the public by the submitter, and is not routinely available to the public from other sources. (3) If a submitter ’s statement cannot be obtained within the time limit for processing the request under §2.17, the requester shall be notified of the delay as provided in §2.17(f). (4) Notification to a submitter is not required if: (i) The bureau determines, prior to giving notice, that the request for the record should be denied; (ii) The information has previously been lawfully published or officially made available to the public; (iii) Disclosure is required by a stat- ute (other than the FOIA) or regula-tion (other than this subpart); (iv) Disclosure is clearly prohibited by a statute, as described in §2.13(c)(3); (v) The information was not des- ignated by the submitter as confiden-tial when it was submitted, or a rea-sonable time thereafter, if the sub-mitter was specifically afforded an op-portunity to make such a designation; however, a submitter will be notified of a request for information that was not designated as confidential at the time of submission, or a reasonable time thereafter, if there is substantial rea-son to believe that disclosure of the in-formation would result in competitive harm. (vi) The designation of confiden- tiality made by the submitter is obvi-ously frivolous; or (vii) The information was submitted to the Department more than 10 years prior to the date of the request, unless the bureau has reason to believe that it continues to be confidential.
