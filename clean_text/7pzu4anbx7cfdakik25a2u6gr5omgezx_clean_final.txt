Wasatch Front Imagery UpdatePosted by Rick Kelson - 2009/04/21 16:42 _____________________________________ The majority of the Salt Lake County 12.5cm imagery was collected today. Mapcon will be moving north to collect the other 12.5cm areas over the next few days. I looks as if weather may become a factor again by the end of the week. The flights will resume again after the weather clears. ============================================================================ Re:Wasatch Front Imagery UpdatePosted by Rick Kelson - 2009/06/25 16:39 _____________________________________ _*Image Acquisition:*_ All project areas have been flown and the data has been reduced to 6629 individual RGB files that are stored in an uncompressed straight TIFF format. The associated ABGPS/IMU data has been delivered to you. This portion of the project has been invoiced and payment has been received. _*Metadata:*_ Attached is a draft document as an example of the files to be delivered. I have indicated by highlighting the fields which require your input (yellow) and those that will change based upon the individual ortho tile attributes (cyan). We await your review and feedback. _*Aerial Triangulation/Orthophoto Production: *_The Salt Lake County block (1535 images) has been run and we are waiting for additional source imagery (2006 12.5 cm) to extend the existing control network. Delivery of the orthophoto tiles for this block should occur within 3 weeks of receipt of the above mentioned images. The Northern 12.cm block (2203 images) is in the initial AT process. Weber County has provided you with authorization to release the 2006 imagery. Weber County also placed additional survey control targets for the Upper Ogden Valley area, but we have not received the control list as of today. Davis County has indicated that release of the 2006 imagery should be forthcoming. We anticipate delivery of the orthophoto tiles for this block by the first week of August. The Wasatch Front 25 cm imagery (1517 images) would follow the completion of the 12.5 cm imagery with an expected delivery by the end of August. The control for the Dugway 25 cm imagery (1374 images) has been completed and I will deliver the source data to you next week. This area will use separate production resources from the Wasatch Front area and we anticipate completion prior to the end of August. ============================================================================ Re:Wasatch Front Imagery UpdatePosted by Rick Kelson - 2009/08/24 09:20 _____________________________________ The Salt Lake County 12.5 cm block (1535 images) is complete. Delivery of the orthophoto tiles occurred on August 8th. Two of the 2000 M tiles from this block will be re-delivered as four1000 M tiles. These tiles along with the relevant support data (metadata files, index sheet and shape file) will be delivered by August 27th. Attached is a preliminary AT report. The AT process for the Northern 12.5 cm block (2205 images) is complete. A preliminary AT report will be delivered by August 27th. We estimate delivery of the orthophoto for this block tiles by September 10th. Utah GIS Forum - Utah GIS Portal FireBoard Forum Component version: 1.0.4 Generated: 11 July, 2010, 09:19

The AT is underway for the Dugway 25 cm imagery (1374 images). We anticipate completion of this and the orthophoto process by September 4th. The AT process for the Wasatch Front 25 cm imagery (1517 images) is also in production. Delivery of these orthophoto tiles and the re-sampled 5 cm to 25 cm tiles will occur by September 30th. It is our intention to provide a single formal Aerial Triangulation report for entire project and deliver the same by the end of September. ============================================================================ Utah GIS Forum - Utah GIS Portal FireBoard Forum Component version: 1.0.4 Generated: 11 July, 2010, 09:19
