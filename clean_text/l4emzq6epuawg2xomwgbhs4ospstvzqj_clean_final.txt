The property is bordered to the north and west by remaining acres of the Turf Valley Golf Course a nd Resort, beyond which to the east are single-family residences. Bordering the property to the south is the maintenance area of the Turf Valley resort, and to the east is Interstate 70. The property is located in a groun dwater use area of Howa rd County and groundwater flow beneath the property is to the south. The clos est potable water supply wells located within a 0.5-mile radius of the property are to the west on the remaining acres of the Turf Valley Golf Course and Reso rt. The property is improved with three out-of-play golf hole complexes. Site History: Land title records indicate private ownership of th e property until 1996, when the current owners, Mangione Enterprises of Turf Valley Limited Partnership, acquired the property. Th e property was utilized as agricultural land until 1952, and as a golf course between 1990 and 2002. The property currently consists of woods, dense vegetation and out-of-play golf hole complexes with associated asphalt paved golf cart paths. Environmental Investigations and Actions: Several environmental investigations have been perf ormed at the property. Ph ase I environmental site assessments (ESAs) were conducted at the proper ty in March 2005 and September 2007, which identified nuisance debris piles on the property. In August 2004, a Phase II ESA was completed at the prop erty which included the analysis of surface soil samples from the golf course features on site for arsenic, lead mercury and pesticides. The analytical results from the samples collected from the existing tees, greens and fairways identified arsenic, mercury and lead at the property. In May 2005, soil samples were collected at the property that identified lead and ar senic in the surface soil located on site. Between November 2005 and January 2006, areas on the Phase 1 portion of the property were excavated. Soil samples were collected in the excavated areas loca ted at the property. The analytical results of the soil samples collected indicated the pres ence of metals at the propert y at concentrations below the Maryland Department of the Environment’s (MDE’s) Cleanup Standards for Soil and Groundwater. Between October 2009 and December 2009, an additional environmental investigation, which included the collection of groundwater and additional soil samples, wa s performed at the property. The analytical results of the groundwater samples collected at the property indicated the presen ce of metals at concentrations below the Environmental Protection Agency’s maximu m contaminant levels for all identified compounds.

In March 2010, mercury vapor samples were collected at the property in order to evaluate whether the concentrations of elemental mercury present in the surficial soils at th e property posed a risk from vapor intrusion to indoor ai r. Based on the analytical results of the mercury vapo r samples collected at the property, the Department determined that the concentratio ns of elemental mercury in the surficial soil did not pose a vapor intrusion to i ndoor air risk at the site. Current Status: Two entities, Mangione Enterprises of Turf Valley, Lim ited Partnership and Villages at Turf Valley LLC submitted Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) applicati ons for the property on October 20, 2008, seeking a No Further Requirement Determination (NFRD). Duri ng the review of the appl ication package and all additional documents, the Department determined that the property did not qualify for a NFRD, and required the submittal of a Response Action Plan (RAP). On February 19, 2010, the Department accepted the VCP application submitted by Mangione Enterprises of Turf Valley, Limited Partnership and Villages at Turf Valley LLC for the Turf Valley Villages Phase 1 and 3 property into the VCP and requested the development of a proposed RAP in order to address potential risks associated with the property. The Department is currently awaiting the submitta l of the proposed RAP for the property. Contact: For additional information, please contact th e Land Restoration Program at (410) 537-3493.
