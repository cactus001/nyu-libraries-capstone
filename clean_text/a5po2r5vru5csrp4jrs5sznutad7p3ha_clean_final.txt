SEC REPORTS ON WINDERMERE HOTEL REORGANIZATION. The SEC today filed a report with the U. S. District Court in Chicago on the fairness and feasibility of two plans for reorganization of Windermere Hotel Company, which owns and operates the Windermere East Hotel in Chicago (Release CR-162). One plan, proposed by the Trustee and sponsored by Richard Goodman, a bondholder, provides for the issuance of $1,598,000 of new 5~ 20-year debentures and 31,960 shares of common stock by the reorganized company, all to holders of the $3,196,000 of presently outstanding bonds (stockholders would not participate under either plan). The new debentures and common stock would be distributed on the basis of $50 of debentures and one share for each $100 bond; and the new debentures would be junior in rank to a new first mortgage of $1,000,000 the proceeds of which would be used for capital improvements. As an alternative, the bondholders (other than Goodman) may elect to receive from Goodman $70 in cash for each $100 bond (in lieu of the $50 debenture and one share). The other plan, proposed by Max Shlensky, another bondholder, provides that present bondholders would re- ceive for each $100 bond either (i) $70 in cash or (ii) $20 in cash plus a new $50 bond of the reorganized company. The Commission concluded that both plans were fair, equitable and feasible in their provision for an identical all-cash payment to present bondholders of $10 1n cash and the exclUSion of present stockholders from participation. However, the Commission contended that, for various stated reasons, the alternative proposals in each plan are not feasible. The Commission also urged that the indebtedness of the reorganized company should not exceed $1,600,000. FOUR STOCKS ACCORDED UNLISTED TPAnING.
