I want to thank Chairwoman McCarthy, Ranking Member Platts and members of the Sub-committee on Healthy Families and Communities f or holding this hearing to explore the gang prevention activities on Long Island to le arn what might be replicated across the country. The reduction of gang recruitment effort s along with prevention of gang related crime is essential to the safety of all residents o f our country. The FBI Long Island Office reports that the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, gang has been deemed to be a "High Threat" to the northeast section of our country due to its involvement in murder, assaults with weapons, firearms possession, drug distributio n, extortion from businesses, prostitution and robbery. The immediate focus of the Freeport Police Departme nts efforts to mitigate gang recruitment was a Gang Awareness Suppression and Pr evention Program (GASPP). The demographics of the street gang population encompas s a broad spectrum of race, ethnicity, gender and age and the program provides gang related information to parents, community members, school staffs, and the work forc e in an effort to reduce gang recruitment The awareness component of GASPP provides a descrip tion of various behaviors, and physical observations, which together or in some ca ses independently, are indicative of gang involvement. While the information provided i n the GASPP brochure (attachment # 1) is representative of gang indicators, it is no t all-inclusive. Symbols, colors, hand signs, clothing and gang codes consistently change due to Police awareness and fashion trends. The changes in team logos and colors of pr ofessional sports organizations are frequently the impetus for such changes. The prevention element of GASPP encompasses many yo uth-oriented activities. These include mentoring programs for elementary school st udents, along with a guide for parents that advises them of the many programs avai lable to their child as an alternative to gangs. Community members and businesses are req uested to engage in positive interaction with adolescents to encourage appropria te social interaction. Business owners, residents, and team coaches, are all reques ted to actively communicate with students who are engaging in inappropriate behavior . This is done in a manner that is courteous and provides positive instruction as a me ans of conveying the necessity of civil behavior and to further individual achievement. T he School District Superintendent, together with high and middle school administrators , meet monthly with a Freeport Police Department command staff member to develop s trategy to prevent gang activity in the schools and community based upon recent gang in cidents. Informal sharing occurs between the school staff and police in close time p roximity to any gang involved offense when students are participants. (Please see attach ment #1 for detailed explanation of the GASPP program.) The suppression element of GASPP involves various l aw enforcement programs that are performed independently or in conjunction with comm unity resources to discourage gang-related activity. Suppression efforts include partnerships with federal and state prosecutors, along with a task force made up of fed eral, state and local law enforcement

members. Participation in the FBI Gang Task Force has provided additional law enforcement resources for conducting criminal inves tigations of gangs with a focus on their leadership. These investigations have result ed in the arrest and successful prosecution of sixty-five members of Mara Salvatruc ha, or MS-13. Other gangs that are prevalent through out Long Island such as the Latin King, Bloods, and Crips are being investigated for crimes similar to the type committ ed by MS-13, by both the FBI Gang Task Force and local law enforcement. The Federal Court, without a prior conviction of a predicate felony, may not prosecute individual ga ng members, who are seventeen years of age or less. Therefore gang members who have a defense based on their age are prosecuted locally. The MS 13 members who were arr ested were involved in the commission of various violent crimes that include d ealing drugs, possession of firearms, rape, robbery and murder. Another cooperative gang suppression effort is a pa rtnership with the Nassau County Probation Department that teams Police Officers wit h Probation Officers. The Probation Department Officers lead the teams that visit the r esidences of probationers who are gang members. These visits serve to ensure that the pro bationers are not in violation of any terms of their probation. This compliance program also verifies that gang members are not associating with other gang members or in posse ssion of any firearms or drugs. It also provides a means to establish that they are ab iding by curfew restrictions, thereby discouraging their participation in crime. Supplementing traditional gang prevention technique s, the Freeport Police Department has developed and implemented a Home Visit Program (HVP). The HVP has been designed to assist the parents of gang members by h elping them recognize their child's association with a gang. This usually takes place prior to an arrest of their son or daughter. After a Police Officer has confirmed tha t an individual is involved with a gang and the information is passed on to the Commanding Officer of the Freeport Police Department’s Community Response Unit (CRU). Two De tectives are assigned to conduct a home visit of the gang member's family to discuss their child's participation in the gang and advise them of the resources available to the family to help them discourage their child's further participation in the gang. The initial reaction to the police visit is denial of their child’s involvement. Only after th e detectives present the parents with evidence that includes gang indicators such as tatt oos, limited clothing attire restricted by color, letters or product initials, observation of hand signing, and their child or friends, are not hearing challenged, along with drawings, an d gang paraphernalia in their school bags or books do, the parents realize that their ch ild is involved with gangs. In some instances, parents have relocated their son or daug hter with relatives in other states or even other countries. Other parents have expressed frustration and a lack of hope with regard to their child’s future. A small percentage are currently gang members themselves or don’t see a problem with their child’s involved gang membership. During testimony to the Nassau County Legislation Public Safety Comm ittee, a Roosevelt, N.Y. Community Activist testified that the gang members in her neighborhood helped her grow up and she saw no problem with them hanging ou t with her children. She further stated that the only gang she was afraid of was the gang dressed in blue that drive white cars with blue and orange stripes. This was a refe rence to the Nassau County Police

Department. To make the HVP more effective, a part nership has been established with the Freeport Pride Youth Outreach organization, tha t has resulted in providing the parents with follow up referral services and involvement by their social workers. School Based Programs The Freeport Police Department Adopt-A-Cop Program is another activity that was developed to discourage youth from entering a gang. The Adopt A Cop Program was formulated to provide a positive informal interacti on between students and police officers. The program requires the "adoption" of o ne police officer by each 4 th grade class who will meet with their "adopted" Officer at the onset of the program and monthly thereafter throughout the school year. The officers who are involved in the Adopt A Cop program are volunteers. Of the ninety-two Freeport police officers, twenty-eight volunteer as Adopt A Cops. During the monthly meeting, officers conduct an ope n exchange of ideas and discussions with their students that centers around the fore me ntioned goals and objectives. The officers also schedule tours of Police Headquarters and attend the school trips by their respective classes. At the completion of each meet ing, each student composes a letter to their police officer including any comments or ques tions which pertains to the prior meeting, or other police related concerns. The off icer responds with a general letter to the entire class, which is read to them by their te acher in between meetings. At the end of the school year, all of the fourth gr ade students, their adopted Police Officers and additional Police resources, celebrate the end of their school year together with Adopt A Cop Day. The day is filled with inter active presentations that include tours of a Police helicopter, Horse Mounted Officer, SCUB A and K-9 demonstrations. Pizza, hot dogs, soda and ice cream are enjoyed by all of the day's participants. In addition each child is also given an Adopt a Cop tee shirt. Goals and Objectives: The goals and objectives of the Adopt A Cop program are to: A) Encourage the mutually beneficial exchange of information an d concerns between the Adopted Cop and his/her class. B) Provide a positive police officer role model, thereby disp elling negative police stereotypes. C) Educate children about their safety, and discuss methods w hich the children may use to avoid potential hazardous situations, including gang recruitment efforts.

D) Discuss projects and non-violent forms of entertain ment as a positive alternative to questionable media entertainment. E) Provide an avenue for children to discuss positive alternate means to resolve conflict, or express anger or frustration as an alt ernative to violence or alcohol/drug use. F) Provide insight into the function of police officer s, and encourage students to consider law enforcement as a possible career. G) Contribute to the development of the children who p articipate in the Adopt A Cop program. Each of the officers who participate as Adopt-A-Cop Program volunteers receive the Freeport Police Department Community Service Award at the bi-annual award dinner. This program is currently in its eleventh year of o peration. The Safe Schools Healthy Students grant had funded a similar but much smaller police mentoring program that was designed for middle scho ol students, who were recognized to be considered "at risk" of gang involvement. Th is program had been proposed by the Freeport Police Department to the Safe Schools Heal thy Students Program Committee Members. The committee included the Freeport Schoo l District, Nassau County BOCES, Operation Pride, Freeport Youth Outreach, and the S outh Shore Child Guidance Center. Middle school students were selected as the program participants due to a conscious belief by the program membership that this mentorin g program would complement the Adopt-A-Cop program. Due to grant funding limitatio ns, the program was limited with regard to the number of participants to achieve the greatest impact with limited resources. It was decided that middle school administrators an d teachers would select those students they believed to be “at risk” of gang involvement f or this program. Ultimately the program would include this group of middle school students who the committee members believed would benefit the most f rom interaction with police officers. The programs six police officers would i nteract weekly during a shared school based lunch meeting. On weekends, students and pol ice officers would jointly participate in sports, trips, and movie outings. The officers received an hourly rate, which was substantially less than their police officer salari es as per diem school district employees. Unfortunately, in spite of its success, when the gr ant funding expired, the school district was unable to continue the program.

Gang prevention efforts must also include education al programs that assist adolescents in achieving important developmental skills. In 2004, the Freeport Police Department introduced an employment skills workshop designed t o facilitate employment opportunities for middle school students. The work shop provides these students with insight into the job application process, interview , preparation and employment expectations. The information provided affords stu dents the opportunity to be readily prepared to seek employment opportunities, thereby offering a counter balance to the limitations imposed by gang membership. Gangs gran t status to members who are violent, possess an active and lengthy criminal rec ord and embrace a disregard of societies value on life, individual responsibility and achievement. These traits are counterproductive to being successful in seeking em ployment. The aforementioned gang tenets preclude a chance for a successful job inter view in contrast to the Employment Skills Workshop. (Please see attachment #2, Emplo yment Skills Workshop). Community Partnership The aforementioned police initiatives were presente d as initial efforts to address the proliferation of gangs and related crime issues. C ontinuing in this vein in 2002, Mayor Glacken and the Board of Trustees with the Freeport Police Department, in conjunction with the Freeport school district, formed a consort ium of various organizations and institutions that are associated with the Freeport community. The organization was formed and named the Officials Working Group (OWG) for the purpose of preventing gang related crime through the concerted utilizatio n of new and existing resources. The main committee meets monthly, while the sub-committ ees meet during the month and report on their progress at the main monthly meetin g. Representation on the committee rapidly expanded to include the Nassau County District Attorney's Office, Nassau County Youth Board, Freep ort Parent Teachers Association (PTA), Hofstra University Liberty Partnership, Nass au County Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Junior Achievement, Nassau Count y Equal Opportunity Commission, Freeport Recreation Department, Freepor t Pride, Education Tutorial Services, Struggling To Reunite Our New Generation (STRONG), along with representatives of various religious clergy and com munity advocates. The School Superintendent chairs the committee. In the beginning, the committee decided to focus on reducing crime by addressing street gang violence and related anti-social behavior in t he schools and community. Committee members determined that the first objective would b e to discourage gang recruitment efforts through community and parental awareness pr esentations. A revised gang awareness program was developed from the pre-existi ng Freeport Police Department Gang Awareness, Suppression & Prevention (GASP) pro gram. The expanded Gang Awareness Program (GAP) is designed to inform commu nity members, with an emphasis

--- Page 5 ---
on parents of students, about how to determine if a person is involved in a gang through the identification of specific characteristics uniq ue to street gang members. In addition, the presentation list the reasons people join gangs , along with a description of their rites of initiation and explanation of the types of crime s they are associated with. The most powerful allure of a gang is the sense of power and respect that is perceived to come with membership; the power of numbers, control of a neighborhood, and fear of their potential for committing random acts of viole nce, that is mistaken for respect. These misplaced beliefs, in conjunction with a sens e of being family or brothers or sisters against other gangs and those who they perceive as being different, creates a sense of unity. In reality, the love, power, respect, and u nity of gang membership is a path to arrest, imprisonment, injury, hospitalization, and death. A community involvement component of GAP lists the various resources availa ble to discourage gang recruitment efforts. This includes involvement in alternative structural school activities, increased parental involvement in the education process, and access to professional counseling in schools via accredited private social outreach serv ices. These prevention efforts, to be effective, must be in place to assist students as e arly as third grade. One OWG sub-committee has developed a bilingual “Gu ide to School and Community Activities for School Age Children.” The guide pro vides parents with a broad variety of supervised and structured activities as an alternat e to idle time. The activities are listed according to a child’s age and grade. (Please see a ttachment #3 for the current guide). A member of the OWG who was partnered with an offic er from the Freeport Police Department Community Response Unit (cru) gave each GAP presentation, and by February 2004, every school PTA in the Freeport Sch ool District had a GAP presentation.. Additional presentations are curren tly offered to any religious congregation or civic association willing to host t he program. Unfortunately, most of the presentations that have taken place were poorly att ended. The expansion of Police Department school-based men toring programs, interagency collaboration and interactive resident/police commu nications respective to street crime or related activity, supplement the many initiatives d escribed above. In conjunction with these efforts, the Police Department provides an as sessment of the gang issues facing village residents along with insight into existing police-sponsored programs and enforcement operations. Group dynamics of the OWG participants have afforded the members an opportunity to enhance existing programs . As discussed prior, the Freeport Police Department "Home Visit Program" (HVP) has be en changed to provide an additional resource. Now when CRU officers visit t he homes of known gang members to offer assistance to the gang member's parent(s), an additional service is provided. Freeport Pride, a private youth outreach program, i s working with CRU officers to include their social workers in the HVP to offer th eir assistance and alternate program awareness to the gang members family.

Another sub-committee is tasked with researching ne w programs for students as a deterrent to gang recruitment. The committee membe rs also arrange for former gang members or other motivational speakers to address s tudent groups. One sub-committee has the responsibility for researching new law prop osals that are designed to deter gang related crime. Other members are assigned to pursu e the development of new initiatives and partnerships with like organizations outside Fr eeport. These include the; Hispanic Counseling Center, Family and Children Associations , Nassau County Youth Board, Nassau County Department of Social Services, and th e Salvation Army. One of the new initiatives that have been implement ed is a student survey. The survey was conducted in anticipation that the results woul d assist the committee with identifying areas of need that the committee would focus on to better assist students with meeting today's challenges. The framework of the Search In stitute survey evaluates a student’s sense of possessing skills or “Developmental Assets ” in the following five categories. 1) On going relationships with caring adults. 2) Safe places and structured activities during non-sc hool hours. 3) A healthy start for a healthy future. 4) Marketable skills through effective education. 5) Opportunities to serve. Currently the OWG is evaluating the results of a De velopmental Asset Survey that was given to even grade students from 4 th to 12 th grades. The Search Institute vision is to "Have a world where all young people are valued and thrive". (Please see attachment #4 for a descriptive booklet on the survey) While Freeport School students offered responses th at are comparable to national average results, the specific asset deficiencies were dishe artening. This is especially true with regard to the following; 1) Positive family communications-only 16% locally and 28% nationally have this asset 2) Have high expectations for themselves-56% locally a nd 48% nationally have this asset 3) A sense of bonding to the school-38% locally and 52 % nationally have this asset 4) The ability to initiate peaceful conflict resolutio n-21% locally and 40% nationally 5) A sense of feeling safe-42% locally and 51% nationa lly 6) Have and understand family boundaries-36% locally a nd 46% nationally 7) Experience positive peer influence-54% locally and 63% nationally 8) Use time at home constructively-43% locally and 51% nationally 9) Feel capable of exercising restraint-30% locally an d 45% nationally The above survey results, while not specific entice ments to gang involvement, help explain the allure of a gang as a surrogate family. The unity, love and respect that is

--- Page 7 ---
perceived to be, or is missing in the family, creat es a void that gang membership purports to fill. Family values once taken for granted as the founda tion for child development have been seriously eroded. Inappropriate societal influenc es including entertainment media, video games, and magazines, such as "Don Diva", glorify v iolence and misogynistic views. These sources, combined with a news media, that sen sationalizes horrific acts of violence, become difficult influences for parents a nd schools to overcome. In addition, a confused sense as to what constitutes traditional c ultural values contributes to minimizing the reservations a person may have with regard to j oining a gang. Multi-culturalism without support for the establish ed cultural values & beliefs contributes to national confusion on how to address many of the problems facing society. A "melting pot" without a common language will become a "Tower of Babble". The ability to engage in effective communication is an essential e lement of any successful gang eradication effort. Confused or misunderstood comm unications frequently result in unattended and sometimes deadly consequences. I ha ve witnessed native-born gang members openly discuss their distrust of non-Englis h speaking members of opposing gangs during school gang prevention workshops. The allure of gang membership in some cases origina tes from a family member. In many cases either the father or sibling is the pathway t o gang membership. The family legacy road to gang membership is more common within Hispa nic gangs, where two or more generations who belong to the same gang may live to gether. Even families without a gang member within it are experiencing difficulty w ith raising their children due to the outside influences. In a recent disturbing trend, the Freeport Police D epartment has experienced an increase in domestic incident calls that involve parents who state that they are overwhelmed and feels incapable of dealing with the behavioral issu es of their child. Most of these parents are looking for help and guidance. Others have sta ted that they don't care about their child and want the Police to take them and place th em in jail or any place, just away from them. These children have been abandoned in place and will be at risk absent meaningful intervention by reinvigorated and accomplished gove rnment services. The effectiveness of the programs described herein is difficult to weigh. In spite of the efforts expended, gangs proliferate in surrounding communities, while their membership numbers remain relatively constant within Freeport. The gang recruiting that has been thwarted is due to the collective labors of the Fre eport Police Department and its many partners. The total magnitude of the gang activity that has been prevented is an intangible. The obvious and consensus view is that more needs to be done on the federal, state and local levels. The most important next step is changing the cultur e to restore values that incorporate and encourage a sense of unity, respect, and devoti on to guarantee the rights of others to be free from threats, intimidation or harm. Free s peech issues must be weighed in the

context of offense it was intended to cause. Restr ictions on profanity do not restrict a person’s ability to communicate. Conversely, our a bility to communicate would be enhanced by the expansion of vocabulary for the pur pose of engaging in persuasive communication without vulgarity. The family must plant courtesy and the skills of po sitive social interaction during infancy. Overwhelmingly, television has become the primary b abysitter of youth. The social skills developed through this medium bare little re semblance to “Sesame Street” and are more representative of the “Jerry Springer Show.” Parenting skill programs and related educational programs must find a way into our early child development efforts. The subsequent benefit to focusing on early development skills and communication programs will achieve benefits in reducing domestic violence , providing academic, and skills learning, all of which are measurable outcomes. The y also support a cohesive family unit as the primary deterrent to gang involvement. Furt hermore we must work to ensure that all people are embraced and afforded opportunity as true equals. This is a daunting task that must be implemented as soon as possible. Any thing less than the timely implementation of these principles will guarantee t hat our gang prevention efforts will be as successful as the current "war on drugs".
