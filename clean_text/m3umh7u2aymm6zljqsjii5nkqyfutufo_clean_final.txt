SUMMARY H.Res. 759 resolves that Congress recognizes th e 20th anniversary of the Freedom Sunday Rally for Soviet Jews in Washington, DC, which embodi es the American princi ple of citizen activism for the greater good. BACKGROUND Beginning in 1967, many Jews applied to leave the S oviet Union to immigrate to other countries and were denied permission to emigrate by th e Soviet government. This group was commonly referred to as the refuseniks. The United States placed some sanctions on the Soviet Union. In 1975, President Gerald Ford signed the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trad e Act of 1974 into law. This Act prohibited the extension of trade benefits to countries that limit emigration. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan enacted P.L. 97-157 which expressed the sense of Congress that the Soviet Union should cease its repressive actions against individuals w ho seek the freedom to emigrate or to practice their religious or cu ltural traditions. In 1984, the Congressional Coaliti on for Soviet Jews was formed to keep members and their staffs informed on developments in the Soviet Union. In 1987, more than 250,000 people participated in the Freedom Sunday Rally on the National Mall in support of the Soviet Jewry before the start of the Reagan-Gorbachev summit. In 1989, the Soviet Union relaxed their emigration policies and allo wed the Soviet Jews to leave the country. The Soviet Union c odified the right of every Sovi et citizen to emigrate in 1991.
