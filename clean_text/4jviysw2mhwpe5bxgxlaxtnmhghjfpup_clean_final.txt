In a recent report to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works , the Government Ac- countability Office (GAO) pre-sented the results of a survey con- ducted among fifty wastewater ex- perts nationwide who were asked to answer the following questions: • Which wastewater assets are most vulnerable to terrorist at- tacks? (See below) • What security enhancing actions are most deserving of federal support? (See page 2) • What criteria should be used for determining those utilities having the highest priority for federal funding to improve security? (See page 2) • What is the best method to distribute federal funds? (See page 2) The results of the survey are presented in the follow- ing, starting immediately below and continuing on through page 2. The Five Most Vulnerable Wastewater Assets Fifty experts asked to identify wastewater assets that are the most vulnerable to security threats picked the following: 1 Collection system’s network of sewers (42 votes) 2 Treatment chemicals (32 votes) 3 Key components of the treatment plant, such as the headworks (29 votes) 4 Supervisory Control and Data Ac quisition (SCADA ) systems (18) 5 Pumping stations (16) IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONM ENTAL QUALITY, WASTEWATER PROGRAM WASTEWATER SECURITY FACT SHEET Wastewater Security is Focus of GAO-05-165 Report How can waste water security be enhanced?

Security-Enhancing Activities Deserving Federal Support 1 Direct grants (34 votes) 2 Clean Water State Revolving Fund (5 votes) 3 Loans or loan guarantees (1 vote) When asked to rate the best mechanisms for distributing fed- eral funds to be used to enhance wastewater security, the fifty ex-perts chose the following: How Should Federal Funds be Distributed? Who Should Get Federal Funds? 1 Utilities serving critic al infrastructure (39 votes) 2 Utilities using large quantities of gaseous chemicals (26 votes) 3 Utilities serving large populations (24 votes) When asked which utilities should get top priority for fed- eral funds to enhance the se- curity of wastewater systems, the panel of fifty experts cited the following criteria most fre- quently: When asked to pick those security- enhancing activities most deserving of fed-eral support, the sur- vey of experts polled for GAO-05-165 cited the following: 1 Replacing gaseous chemicals used in wastewater treatment with less hazardous alternatives (29 votes) 2 Improving local, state, and regional collaboration efforts (23 votes) 3 Completing vulnerability assessments for individual wastewater systems (20 votes) TWENTY-NINE OF FIFTY EXPERTS SURVEYED RATED THE REPLACEMENT OF GASEOUS CHEMICALS WITH LESS HAZARDOUS ALTERNATIVES TO BE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR FEDERAL FUNDING. WASTEWATER SECURI TY FACT SHEET How do wastewater experts think security can be enhanced and funded? Source: GAO-05-165. CWSRF Programs: More than $40 Billion In Low-Interest Loans EPA’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program has provided more than 14,000 low-interest loans for “water quality protection projects for wastewater treatment, nonpoint source pollution control, and watershed and estuary management.” “CWSRFs offer: • Low interest rates, flexible terms • Significant funding for nonpoint source pollution control and estuary protection • Assistance to a variety of borrowers • Partnerships with other funding sources” For additional information, see the addresses below: http://www.epa.gov/owmitnet/cwfinance/cwsrf/index.htm FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON CONSTRUCTION LO ANS FOR PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS IN IDAHO, SEE: HTTP://WWW.DEQ.IDAHO.GOV/WATER/ASSIST_BUSI NESS/PWWS/CONSTRUCTION_LOANS.CFM Access EPA’s Water Security Web site at: http: //cfpub.epa.gov/safewater/w atersecurity/index.cfm

EPA pro-vides links to resources that can help utilities perform security vul-nerability assessments. Among the resources that can be accessed from the EPA site are the following: Basic Elements of Vulnerability Assessments: Characterization of the water system, including mission and objectives Identification and prioritization of adverse consequences Determination of critical assets Assessment of the likelihood of malevolent acts Evaluation of existing countermeasures Analysis of current risk and development of a prioritized plan for risk reduction. For additional information, see the address below: The Environmental Protection Agency’s Water Security Web site provides resources of interest to utilities and others involved in ensuring security. Top-ics addressed on this site include: • Vulnerability assessments • Emergency/incident planning • Security enhancements, research, and technology • Legislation and directives, including links to Homeland Security Presiden- tial Directives and federal laws • Resources for small utilities • Resources for public involvement • Resources for information sharing EPA Vulnerability Assessment Fact Sheet http://www.epa.gov/safewater/waters ecurity/pubs/va_fact_sheet_12-19.pdf In this wastewater fact sheet, the focus is on securi ty, starting with the findings of GAO-05-165 and continu- ing through some other compelling wastewater security related suggestions and recommendations of merit. In an era in which terrorism remains a major threat to the security of our country’s infrastructure, including wastewater systems, we are sure that you will find this information to be not only thought-provoking, but worthy of your attention.
