BARROW STATEMENT ON AIG BONUSES Washington, DC - Congressman John Barrow (GA-12) released the following statement today: "The more we learn about failed executives of companies like AIG making off with taxpayer money that's supposed to save their companies the angrier I get. This is exactly why I didn't vote for the bailout last fall, and why I think the only money we should be spending should go to keeping families in their homes and putting businesses back to work. We need to crack down on greedy execs who line their pockets with taxpayer money." ### Contact: Jane Brodsky, (202) 225-2823 click here for a .pdf copy of this release John Barrow http://www.barrow.house.gov Powered by Joomla!
