11 September 2011 Government Receipts and Expenditures Second Quarter of 2011 NET GOVERNMENT saving, the difference be­ tween current receipts and current expenditures of the federal government and state and local govern­ ments, was –$1,313.0 billion in the second quarter of 2011, decreasing $54.7 billion from –$1,258.3 billion in the first quarter of 2011. Net federal government saving was –$1,264.4 bil­ lion in the second quarter, decreasing $63.3 billion from –$1,201.1 billion in the first quarter (see page 12). Current receipts decelerated, while current expen­ ditures turned up in the second quarter. Net state and local government saving was –$48.6 billion in the second quarter, increasing $8.6 billion from –$57.2 billion in the first quarter (see page 13). Current receipts turned up, while current expenditures accelerated. Net borrowing was $1,529.3 billion in the second quarter, increasing $62.8 billion from $1,466.5 billion in the first quarter. Federal government net borrowing was $1,435.6 billion in the second quarter, increasing $82.8 billion from $1,352.8 billion in the first quarter. State and local government net borrowing was $93.7 billion, decreasing $20.0 billion from $113.7 billion in the first quarter. “Net lending or net borrowing (–)” is an alternative measure of the government fiscal position. Net bor­rowing is the financing requirement of the government sector, and it is derived as net government saving plus the consumption of fixed capital and net capital trans­ fers received less gross investment and net purchases of nonproduced assets.

Taxes on corporate income turned down as a result of a decrease in domestic corporate profits before tax. Contributions for government social insurance turned up, reflecting an upturn in contributions for social se­ curity. First-quarter contributions were lowered by the reduction in the social security contribution rate. National defense expenditures turned up in the sec­ ond quarter, reflecting upturns in durable goods and services. Government social benefits to persons turned up as a result of an acceleration in social security benefits, and a smaller decrease in unemployment benefits. Refund­ able tax credits remained unchanged after decreasing. Grants-in-aid to state and local governments turned up, reflecting a smaller decrease in Medicaid grants, an upturn in welfare and social grants, and an accelera­ tion in education grants. Interest payments accelerated, reflecting an accelera­ tion in inflation expense payments on Treasury Infla­ tion-Protected Securities. Gross government investment decreased less, reflect­ ing an upturn in defense equipment and software. Estimates of federal government current receipts, current expenditures, and net federal government saving are based on data from the federal budget, from the Monthly Treasury Statement and other reports from the Department of the Treasury, and from other federal government agencies. T otal receipts, total expenditures, and net lending or net borrowing, which are alternative measures of the federal fiscal position, are based on these same sources. Quarterly and annual estimates are published monthly in NIPA table 3.2. Detailed annual estimates of these transac­tions by component are published annually in NIPA tables 3.4–3.8, 3.12, and 3.13. Detailed quarterly estimates are available in underlying NIPA tables at www.bea.gov/ national/nipaweb/nipa_underlying/Index.asp . Each year, BEA translates the information in the federal budget into a NIPA framework.1 For a historical time series of these estimates, see NIPA table 3.18B, which is scheduled to be published in the October 2011 SURVEY .

Taxes on production and imports decelerated as a re­ sult of decelerations in business license taxes and sev­ erance taxes. Federal grants-in-aid to state and local governments turned up, reflecting a smaller decrease in Medicaid grants, an upturn in welfare and social grants, and an acceleration in education grants. Consumption expenditures decelerated because of a deceleration in expenditures for nondurable goods. Government social benefits turned up as a result of an upturn in Medicaid benefits.

The estimates of state and local government current re­ ceipts and expenditures and total receipts and expenditures are mainly based on compilations of data for state and local government finances. The Census Bureau produces the pri­mary source data: the census of governments that is con­ ducted in years that end in a 2 or a 7 and the Government Finances series of surveys for the other years. In addition, other sources of Census Bureau data are from the Quarterly Summary of State and Local Government Tax Revenue and the monthly Value of Construction Put in Place . Data sources from the Bureau of Labor Statistics include the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and the Employment Cost Index. Quarterly and annual estimates are available monthly in NIPA table 3.3. Detailed annual estimates of state and local government transactions by component are available annually in NIPA tables 3.4–3.8, 3.12, and 3.13. Detailed quarterly estimates are available in underlying NIPA tables at www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/nipa_underlying/ Index.asp . For a historical time series of reconciliations of the NIPA estimates with the Census Bureau data from Government Finances , see NIPA table 3.19. BEA also prepares annual estimates of receipts and expenditures of state governments and of local governments. 1 These estimates are available annually in NIPA table 3.20 (state government receipts and expen­ ditures) and in NIPA table 3.21 (local government receipts and expenditures); see “Newly Available NIPA Tables” in the October 2010 SURVEY .
