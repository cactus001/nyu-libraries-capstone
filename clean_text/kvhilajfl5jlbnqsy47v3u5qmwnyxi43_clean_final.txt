76 40 CFR Ch. I (7–1–07 Edition) § 89.211 each engine family in the trading pro- gram: (1) The engine family; (2) The actual quarterly and cumu- lative applicable production/sales vol-ume; (3) The values required to calculate credits as given in §89.207; (4) The resulting type and number of credits generated/required; (5) How and where credit surpluses are dispersed; and (6) How and through what means credit deficits are met. (d) The manufacturer must retain all records required to be maintained under this section for a period of eight years from the due date for the end-of- model-year report. Records may be re-tained as hard copy or reduced to microfilm, ADP diskettes, and so forth, depending on the manufacturer’s record retention procedure; provided, that in every case all information con-tained in the hard copy is retained. (e) Nothing in this section limits the Administrator’s discretion in requiring the manufacturer to retain additional records or submit information not spe-cifically required by this section. (f) Pursuant to a request made by the Administrator, the manufacturer must submit to the Administrator the infor-mation that the manufacturer is re-quired to retain. (g) EPA may void ab initio under §89.126(c) a certificate of conformity for an engine family for which the manufacturer fails to retain the records required in this section or to provide such information to the Ad-ministrator upon request. [59 FR 31335, June 17, 1994. Redesignated and amended at 63 FR 56995, 57009, Oct. 23, 1998] § 89.211 End-of-year and final reports. (a) End-of-year and final reports must indicate the engine family, the actual applicable production/sales vol-ume, the values required to calculate credits as given in §89.207, and the number of credits generated/required. Manufacturers must also submit how and where credit surpluses were dis-persed (or are to be banked) and/or how and through what means credit deficits were met. Copies of contracts related to credit trading must be included or supplied by the broker, if applicable. The report shall include a calculation of credit balances to show that the summation of the manufacturer’s use of credits results in a credit balance equal to or greater than zero, except as allowed under §89.203(c)(3)(ii). Manufac-turers participating under the program described in §89.203(c)(3)(ii) shall in-clude the NMHC + NO Xcredit balance and the PM credit balance as of Decem-ber 31 of that calendar year. (b) The applicable production/sales volume for end-of-year and final re-ports must be based on the location of the point of first retail sale (for exam-ple, retail customer, dealer, secondary manufacturer) also called the final product purchase location. (c)(1) End-of-year reports must be submitted within 90 days of the end of the model year to: Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division (6405-J), U.S. Environmental Protec-tion Agency, 401 M St., SW., Wash-ington, DC 20460. (2) Final reports must be submitted within 270 days of the end of the model year to: Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division (6405-J), U.S. En-vironmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. (d) Failure by a manufacturer par- ticipating in the averaging, banking, or trading program to submit any end-of- year or final reports in the specified time for all engines is a violation of sections 203(a)(1) and 213 of the Clean Air Act for each engine. (e) A manufacturer generating cred- its for deposit only who fails to submit end-of-year reports in the applicable specified time period (90 days after the end of the model year) may not use the credits until such reports are received and reviewed by EPA. Use of projected credits pending EPA review is not per-mitted in these circumstances. (f) Errors discovered by EPA or the manufacturer in the end-of-year report, including errors in credit calculation, may be corrected in the final report up to 270 days from the end of the model year. (g) If EPA or the manufacturer deter- mines that a reporting error occurred on an end-of-year or final report pre-viously submitted to EPA under this section, the manufacturer’s credits and VerDate Aug<31>2005 08:02 Sep 10, 2007 Jkt 211161 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Y:\SGML\211161.XXX 211161

77 Environmental Protection Agency § 89.304 credit calculations will be recal- culated. Erroneous positive credits will be void except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Erroneous negative credit balances may be adjusted by EPA. (h) If within 270 days of the end of the model year, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer’s favor (that is, resulting in an increased credit balance) or if the manufacturer discovers such an error within 270 days of the end of the model year, the cred-its shall be restored for use by the manufacturer. [59 FR 31335, June 17, 1994. Redesignated and amended at 63 FR 56995, 57009, Oct. 23, 1998] § 89.212 Notice of opportunity for hearing. Any voiding of the certificate under §§89.203(d), 89.206(c), 89.209(c) or 89.210(g) will be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been of-fered an opportunity for a hearing con-ducted in accordance with §§89.512 and 89.513 and, if a manufacturer requests such a hearing, will be made only after an initial decision by the Presiding Of-ficer. [63 FR 57010, Oct. 23, 1998] Subpart D—Emission Test Equipment Provisions § 89.301 Scope; applicability. (a) This subpart describes the equip- ment required in order to perform ex-haust emission tests on new nonroad compression-ignition engines subject to the provisions of subpart B of part 89. (b) Exhaust gases, either raw or di- lute, are sampled while the test engine is operated using an 8-mode test cycle on an engine dynamometer. The ex-haust gases receive specific component analysis determining concentration of pollutant, exhaust volume, the fuel flow, and the power output during each mode. Emission is reported as grams per kilowatt hour (g/kw-hr). See sub-part E of this part for a complete de-scription of the test procedure. (c) General equipment and calibra- tion requirements are given in §89.304 through 89.324. Sections 89.325 through 89.331 set forth general test specifica- tions. (d) Additional information about sys- tem design, calibration methodologies, and so forth, for raw gas sampling can be found in 40 CFR part 1065. Examples for system design, calibration meth-odologies, and so forth, for dilute ex-haust gas sampling can be found in 40 CFR part 1065. [59 FR 31335, June 17, 1994. Redesignated at 63 FR 56995, Oct. 23, 1998, as amended at 70 FR 40445, July 13, 2005] § 89.302 Definitions. The definitions in subpart A of this part apply to this subpart. For terms not defined in this part, the definitions in 40 CFR part 86, subparts A, D, I, and N, apply to this subpart. [63 FR 57010, Oct. 23, 1998] § 89.303 Symbols/abbreviations. (a) The abbreviations in §86.094–3 or part 89.3 of this chapter apply to this subpart. (b) The abbreviations in Table 1 in appendix A of this subpart apply to this subpart. Some abbreviations from §89.3 have been included for the con-venience of the reader. (c) The symbols in Table 2 in appen- dix A of this subpart apply to this sub-part. [59 FR 31335, June 17, 1994. Redesignated at 63 FR 56995, Oct. 23, 1998] § 89.304 Equipment required for gas- eous emissions; overview. (a) All engines subject to this subpart are tested for exhaust emissions. En-gines are operated on dynamometers meeting the specification given in §89.306. (b) The exhaust is tested for gaseous emissions using a raw gas sampling system as described in §89.412 or a con-stant volume sampling (CVS) system as described in §89.419. Both systems require analyzers (see paragraph (c) of this section) specific to the pollutant being measured. (c) Analyzers used are a non-disper- sive infrared (NDIR) absorption type for carbon monoxide and carbon diox-ide analysis; a heated flame ionization (HFID) type for hydrocarbon analysis; and a chemiluminescent detector VerDate Aug<31>2005 08:02 Sep 10, 2007 Jkt 211161 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Y:\SGML\211161.XXX 211161
