Wireless Communication Collocation Site Plan Type I Review Handout #74-C Revised: 1/8/09 What types of projects are subject to a Type I Review Process? Collocation of wireless communi cation facilities that are loca ted in Industrial or Forest zone districts in the Rural area or Commerci al districts in the Urban Growth Area are subject to Type I Review re quirements. Type I projects are exempt from the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) review and subject to clear, objective and non- discretionary standards requiring professi onal judgement about technical issues. Type I Site Plan reviews are “ministerial”, requi ring a review and decision by staff unless they are exempt from the si te plan review process. When is a Fire Marshal review required? The following list summarizes when it is necessa ry for the Fire Marshal’s office to review a project. A “yes” answer to any one of thes e questions confirms that a Fire Marshal’s review is necessary. Note: This review may be required even if Type I Site Plan review is not required. Will there be a change in occupancy or use? 2. Is a building permit required, (other than for a single-family residence or a duplex)? Does the project involve a change in vehicular access to the site? Does the review involve fire flow r equirements? For example, will there be an increase in height or interior floor area? Does the review involve ot her fire protection requirements such as fire sprinkler systems, alarm systems, fire hydrants, etc.? Does the project include new constructi on involving review of building setbacks? Is the subject site within the Wildland Urban Interface/Intermix Area? Does the review involve any new building construction or review of limitations to a land use? Does the review involve hazardous proc esses per the Uniform Fire Code, Chapter 80? (Such processes involve hazardous ma terials, flammable liquid or flammable gases.) Is a Pre-application Conference required? No, however an applicant may reques t a pre-application conference. How do I start the application process? The first step is to submit a complete Type I Site Plan Application Form to the Permit Services Center along with t he application fees and the r equired number of copies for all submittal items. (See the atta ched Submittal Requirement list)

Handout #74-C Will I ever get to meet with the st aff members who review my project? Yes. When you submit your applicati on, you will be given a date and time for a “Type I Review Conference”. At this conference you will get to personally meet with your Planner and, depending upon the scope of your project, y ou may also meet with a staff engineer, a Public Works eng ineer, a Deputy Fire Marsha l, a Sheriff’s Deputy, a Building Inspector or Plans Examiner, or a staff member from the Southwest Washington Health District. As the applicant this conference affords you the opportunity to present your proposal and plans to the staff. For staff, the conf erence offers an opportunity to ask questions, give guidance, and to ensure the applicant clearly understands the process and regulations, as they will be affecting them. By the end of the conference, you as the applicant will know whether your project will be approved, approved with c onditions, denied, OR, what additional information the staff will need before they can make a decision. (Your project wi ll be placed on hold if additional information is required.) How does the Type I Site Plan review process work? The County conducts two application checks to ensure that applications are complete before staff begins their development review pr ocess. Prior to accepting an application, the Permit Services staff will conduct a “ Counter Complete “ review of the submittal package. This initial Counter Complete review ensur es that all required submittal items are contained within the package. If each item on the submitta l requirement list has been submitted, the application will be accepted for further review . To be Counter Complete, the following items must be submitted: 1. Cover Sheet & Table of Contents 2. Application Form 3. Application Fee 4. Developer’s GIS Packet Information 5. Narrative 6. Authorization to use Site & Support Structure 7. Legal Lot Determination Information 8. Proposed Site Plan 9. Photographic Analysis 10. Preliminary Stormwater Design Report 11. Associated Applications 12. Submittal Copies Upon acceptance of t he application two things will h appen immediately. First, the counter person will schedule a Ty pe I Conference for you. This conference will be held within 14 to 20 days from the date your application is counter complete. Second, the counter staff will route the appl ication package (with the conference information) to the review staff.

Handout #74-C Within 21 days (or the 14 to 20 days allotted before the Type I Conference) the review staff will conduct a second completeness check, known as the “ Fully Complete “ review. This detailed review ensures that all items submitted have the technical information required for staff to make a decision. If the application is “Fully Complete” the staff has until the Type I Conference date to review the application. The staff is then required to attend the Conference and explain their decision as well as expl ain any conditions of approval that the applicant may have to complete. The staff will then have up to 20 days to issue a written decision. If required technical information or items ar e missing, the planner will prepare a letter indicating the application is “ Not Fully Complete”, and deliv er it to you at the conference. It will indicate the additional it ems and/or information required to make the project “Fully Complete”. If the requested information is not submitted within 30 days, staff will return the application and ref und a portion of the application fee. Once an application is “Fully Complete”, the review staff has 21 days to prepare a written decision that specifies the Conditions of Approval for your project to ensure compliance with all applicable codes and laws. In all, the issuance of a decision may ta ke up to 42 calendar days from the date a counter complete application is accepted by the Permit Serv ices Center, unless it is placed on hold. Can I Request an Extension of Time to Submit Additional Information? Yes. You can submit a written request to extend the decision deadline and submit additional information for consider ation with or after the request. If your application has been deemed “Not Fully Complete” you may also request additional time to submit any information requested. What kind of public notice is provided? There is no public notice required for Type I development proposals. Can the decision be appealed? The staff’s decision may be appealed to the County Hearings Examiner by the applicant or any person or group. An appellant must submit an appeal application and the $1,166 fee within 14 calendar days af ter the written notice of the decision is mailed. How long is my approval valid? A preliminary site plan approval shall be valid for a period of five (5) years after approval. During that time, a complete application for fi nal site plan review OR building permit must be submitted. This time limit may be extended where there is an approved phased development or separate development agreements have been approved, (see Clark County Code, Section 40.500. 010(B) for more details). After the Preliminary Site Plan is approved, what is next? After receiving approval of the prelimin ary site plan, the applicant may submit engineering construction plans, the final site plan (if necessary), and building permits for review.

Handout #74-C Note: Conditions of Approval must be met before you begin your project, occupy your building, or open for business. When can I apply for a building permit? Site plan approval is required prior to the issuance of building permits by the Building Division. However, application for building permits may be made at the same time as application for site plan review . Please note: Should the site plan review process require modification to the site plan, you must revise and re-submit your building plans to reflect those changes. Failure to make the appropriate change s may delay your building inspections or it may result in Code Enforcement actions for th e failure to co mply with the site plan review conditions. Building permi t applications are filed with the Building Division in the Permit Services Center. Please see “Engineering Cons truction Plan Review” info rmation handout for further information about the final engineering pl an and final site plan review process.
