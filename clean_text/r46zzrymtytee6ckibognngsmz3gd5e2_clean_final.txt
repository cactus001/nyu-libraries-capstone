Daily satellite analyses have indicated a decreasing number of possible oil anomalies since the well has been capped. Recent overflights sent to investigate satellite anomalies have on ly reported seeing seaweed with an occ asional colorless sheen. Next Forecast: Aug. 23rd PMMississippi Canyon 252 Incident Location We do not expect any recoverable DWH oil to appear in the offshore environment. However, observations will continue into the f oreseeable future. If the need arises, surface oil trajectories will be produced agai n. Periods of onshore winds may result in some scattered tarball impacts for the next few weeks to months.Nearshore Estimate for: 1200 CDT, 8/21/10 through 8/23/10 Date Prepared: 1800 CDT, Friday, 8/20/10NOAA/NOS/OR&R 0 50 100 25 MilesForecast for 21-Aug.-10 through 23-Aug.-10. NOTE: No offshore recoverable oil expected in the forecast period. Scattered tarball impacts may continue over theforecast period.The next trajectory forecast will beproduced on Monday, Aug. 23
