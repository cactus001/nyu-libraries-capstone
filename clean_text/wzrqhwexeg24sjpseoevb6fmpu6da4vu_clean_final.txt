A-5888 The Union asserts the issue is: Did the employer violate the collective bargaining agreement by not awarding the cold roller job open on May 5, 2000 to the grievant? If so, what is the appropriate remedy?The Company contends the issue is:Did the Company violate Article 4, Section 1 of the collective bargaining agreement when it refused to transfer John Laskowski from his assignment onthe crushing machine to the cold roller? If the Company violated this Article and Section, what is the appropriate remedy? Having considered the parties’ positions, I frame the issue as: Did the Company violate the contract by denying the cold roller job to the grievant and, if so, what remedy is appropriate? PERTINENT CONTRACT LANGUAGE ARTICLE 4. SENIORITY Section 1. Seniority, with ability and qualifications, shall govern in advancement to higher rated jobs. For other than seasonal work, employees will be called back to work by seniority in their classifications. . . . ARTICLE 34. MAINTENANCE OF STANDARDS Section 1. The Employer agrees that all conditions of employment in his individual operation relating to wages, hours of work, overtime differentials, and general working conditions shall be maintained at not less than the higheststandards in effect at the time of the signing of this agreement. . . .

Combination truck driver & machine operator & mechanics$13.98 $14.58 $15.18 $15.78 POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES The Union The Union asserts that the Company violated Article 4, Section 1 and Article 34, Section 1 when the Company denied the grievant the cold roller job in May, 2000. As to Article 4, Section 1, the Union contends that the cold roller job is a “higher rated” job than operating the crusher because of the potential to earn “white sheet” wages.Because the grievant had the “ability and qualifications” to operate the cold roller and hadmore seniority than the employee given the job by the Company, the Union argues that thegrievant was entitled to the job under Article 4, Section 1. The Union disputes the Companycontention that the grievant’s attitude or temper disqualified him from the job. The Unionassert that such factors are not “qualifications”, that the grievant has never been disciplined forhis attitude or temper, that there is no significant evidence that the grievant’s attitude or temperis any worse than other employees, and that there is no documented evidence that thegrievant’s attitude or temper have affected job performance. As to Article 34, Section 1, the Union argues that when jobs have been posted, lateral transfers such as the one sought by the grievant have always been awarded based on seniority.Under such circumstances, the Union asserts that the maintenance of standards language inArticle 34, Section 1 was violated when the grievant was denied the cold roller position.

A-5888 The Union asks that the Company be ordered to cease and desist from violating the contract, place the grievant in the cold roller position, and make him whole for any losses. The Company The Company initially argues that issue to be resolved in arbitration should be limited to the violation of Article 4, Section 1 alleged in the grievance. The Company asserts thatwhere, as here, the grievance makes no mention of a past practice or a maintenance ofstandards clause argument and there is no evidence that such issues were discussed during theprocessing of the grievance, it is inappropriate to consider them now. As to the alleged violation of Article 4, Section 1, the Company contends that because the request transfer was not to a “higher rated job,” Article 4, Section 1 does not apply andthat the Company was free to assign the roller job as it saw fit. The Company argues that theonly contractually recognized basis for “rating” jobs is by pay classification and points out thatthe roller job is in the same pay classification as the crusher work the grievant was performingat the time of the transfer request. Arguments that the roller job is “higher rated” because ofthe potential for earning “white sheet” wages or because the roller job is “easier” should berejected as being speculative, subjective, unworkable and without contractual support. If the Article 34 maintenance of standards issue is entertained, the Company argues that it did not violate this contractual provision because the clause does not apply to the exercise ofmanagement rights such as job assignments and because there is no binding past practice to bemaintained. The Company contends that job assignments are not “general working conditions”within the meaning of Article 34, Section 1. As to the alleged existence of a past practice, theCompany alleges that there is no consistent, mutually accepted practice of awarding a lateraltransfer to the most senior bidder. Lastly, the Company argues that even if it is concluded that Article 4 or 34 generally require that lateral transfers be awarded based on seniority, the grievant was not entitled to thistransfer because he did not have the ability to perform the work to the Company's satisfaction.The Company asserts that its judgement that the grievant’s temperament would prevent theefficient functioning of the paving crew is not arbitrary and capricious and thus should not besecond guessed. Given all of the foregoing, the Company asks that the grievance be denied. DISCUSSION I begin with the issue of whether the dispute before me is limited to the Article 4, Section 1 violation alleged in the grievance or also includes consideration of whetherArticle 34, Section 1 was honored by the Company.

A-5888 The Company correctly notes that arbitrators generally will not decide claims that are raised at the first time at the arbitration hearing. However, absent specific contrary languagein the grievance procedure, where the claim remains the same but additional arguments orcontractual provisions are cited in support thereof, arbitrators generally conclude that they havejurisdiction to consider the additional arguments/contractual provisions. Here, I conclude thatthe claim has remained unchanged (i.e. did the grievant have a contractual right to the rollerjob?) and the Union at hearing advanced an additional contractual argument in support of thatclaim. Under these circumstances, I am persuaded that both Article 4 and Article 34 arebefore me for consideration. As to the alleged violation of Article 4, Section 1, the Company persuasively argues that because the two jobs in question are both Class C jobs for the purposes of wage rates, thegrievant was not seeking a transfer to a “higher rated job” within the meaning of Article 4,Section 1. The only way the contract explicitly “rates” jobs is by hourly wage rate and use ofphrase “higher rated” as opposed to “better” conveys an intent to exclude factors such aswhether a job might be “easier.” For the same reasons, I reject the argument that the potentialfor “white sheet” earnings is a factor in how a job is “rated” under Article 4. Hourly wagerate is the only explicit contractual rating of jobs and the formality of the phrase “higher rated”conveys an intent to exclude other considerations which might make a job “better”- includingthe potential of “white sheet” earnings. While such additional factors clearly will play a rolewhen an employee decides whether to bid on a different job, these factors do not play a rolewhen determining how a job is “rated.” Because the consideration of seniority under Article 4 is limited to “advancement to higher rated jobs,” and because I conclude that moving from the crusher to the roller is not“advancement to a higher rated job,” I find that the Company’s action did not violate Article 4.While the Company is free to consider seniority in such circumstances, it is not contractuallyobligated to do so by Article 4. Turning to Article 34, the contract requires that the Company maintain . . . all conditions of employment in his individual operation relating to wages, hours of work, overtime differentials and general workingconditions . . . (emphasis added). Because the transfer right asserted by the grievant is not a “wage,” “hour of work” or “overtime differential”, the question becomes whether it is a “general working condition”within the meaning of Article 34. I conclude it is not. While it can well be argued that apractice as to transfers is a “condition of employment,” Article 34 only protects those“conditions of employment” that are “general working conditions.” I am persuaded that thecontractual phrase “general working conditions” does not include transfer practices but rather

A-5888 are generally limited to matters such as the physical conditions under which work is performed. Thus, I concluded that the Company’s conduct did not violate Article 34. Given all of the foregoing, I deny the grievance. Dated at Madison, Wisconsin this 31st day of July, 2001. Peter G. Davis, Arbitrator PGD/gjc doc
