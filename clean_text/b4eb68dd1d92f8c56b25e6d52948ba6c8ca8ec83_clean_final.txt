INTRODUCTION The goal of this report is to increase awareness of the data available for humanitarian response activities and to highlight what is missing, as measured through OCHA’s Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) platform. We want to recognize the valuable and long-standing contributions of data-sharing organizations. We also want to be more targeted in our outreach on what data is required to understand crises so that new actors might be compelled to join the platform. Data is not an end in itself but a critical ingredient to the analysis that informs decision making. With nearly 168 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2020 — the highest figure in decades — there is no time, or data, to lose. When HDX was launched in 2014, it held around 800 datasets. Over the past five years, that number has skyrocketed to over 17,000 datasets. The data covers every active humanitarian crisis, from Afghanistan to Yemen, and has been shared by dozens of organizations, from ACLED to WFP . In 2019, HDX was accessed by over 600,000 users. This is a tremendous achievement for collective action in a sector that relies on cooperation. It also shows the value of an open data platform. OCHA’s work to aggregate data from many sources in one place has undoubtedly created eﬀiciency in the system. Humanitarians, donors, academics, and journalists no longer need to chase contacts to locate data; they can go to HDX and search for it. If the data is not there, the HDX team will help find it. One downside to all of this data sharing is knowing what data is most relevant to understanding a crisis context. In May 2019, HDX added a new feature called the Data Grid to help people in their quest for good and relevant data. Based on extensive user research, the Data Grid places the most important crisis data into six categories: aﬀected people; coordination and context; food security and nutrition; geography and infrastructure; health and education; and population and socio-economy. 3 “Accurate data is the lifeblood of good policy and decision-making. Obtaining it, and sharing it across hundreds of organizations, in the middle of a humanitarian emergency, is complicated and time-consuming – but it is absolutely crucial. ” - United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres at the opening of the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data in The Hague in December 20171 2020 Global Humanitarian Overview: https://www.unocha.org/sites/unocha/files/GHO-2020_v9.1.pdf12 Humanitarian data is defined as: 1) data about the context in which a humanitarian crisis is occurring; 2) data about the people aﬀected by the crisis and their needs; and 3) data about the response by organizations and people seeking to help those who need assistance.23 Taken from the opening remarks of the UN Secretary-General at the launch of the Centre for Humanitarian Data in The Hague in December 2017: https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/speeches/2017-12-22/opening-centre-humanitarian-data-remarks3 https://twitter.com/humdata The Centre for Humanitarian Data https://centre.humdata.org | Join our mailing list https://bit.ly/humdatamailing | Twitter https://twitter.com/humdata | Email centrehumdata@un.org

Within each category, there are several sub-categories. For example, within aﬀected people, there are sub- categories for internally displaced people, refugees, returnees, humanitarian needs, and casualties. Within coordination and context, there are sub-categories for ‘who is doing what where’ , aﬀected areas, humanitarian access, and funding, among others. (See Annex A for all sub-category definitions). There are three main criteria for whether relevant data is included in the Data Grid: 1) disaggregated beyond the national level; 2) commonly-used formats; and 3) timeliness. If at least one dataset meets all criteria, that sub- category is considered ‘complete’ . If at least one dataset meets some of these criteria, the sub-category is considered ‘incomplete’ . If a dataset does not meet the criteria or does not exist on HDX, the sub-category is considered empty or as having no data. (See Annex B for details on the Data Grid criteria). Of course, relevant data will greatly depend on who is looking and what they are looking for. A dataset might have the right data, but not cover the part of the country needed for the analysis. Or it might cover the right geographic area but be in a format that is diﬀicult to work with. For this reason, the HDX team reviews all relevant datasets and assesses them against the criteria. This careful curation process is undertaken daily on all newly shared or updated datasets. So far, some 700 datasets have been taken through this process. By the end of December 2019, HDX included Data Grids for 14 locations. These include: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Myanmar, the Philippines, State of Palestine, Somalia, Sudan, Venezuela and Yemen. We will expand the Data Grids to cover all locations with a Humanitarian Response Plan throughout 2020. We may also expand the categories and sub- categories based on feedback. As we start 2020, the completeness of all Data Grids combined is 54 percent. That is, 54 percent of relevant, comprehensive data is available across 14 locations. If we add the data that is relevant but incomplete, the total is 78 percent. This leaves 22 percent of categories with data that does not meet the criteria or with no data. The Data Grids include an average of 20-30 datasets per location. It is important to note that not all humanitarian data can be shared openly. Data about the location of aﬀected people and responders can put people at risk, especially in conflict environments. The HDX Terms of Service prohibit the sharing of data that includes personally identifiable information. For sensitive, non-personal data At least one dataset in the sub-category meets all criteria. At least one dataset in the sub-category meets some criteria.Available data in the sub-category does not meet the criteria or does not exist on HDX. 4Complete Incomplete No data Data completeness: 54% 24%22% Total Percentage Data Complete 54 %Total Percentage Data Incomplete 24 %Total Percentage No Data 22 % A location refers to a country or territory.4 See all response plans here https://www.hpc.tools.

that can be shared under certain conditions, HDX oﬀers a feature, HDX Connect, which enables organizations to share only the metadata and make the underlying data available bilaterally upon request. There are two HDX Connect datasets that are included in the Data Grid, both related to Venezuela. The HDX team will continue to update and expand the Data Grids throughout the year. We look forward to continued collaboration and to closing data gaps. 5Both datasets are from IOM and can be found at: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/venezuela-4w-december-ocha and https://data.humdata.org/dataset/dtm-round-3-flow-monitoring-of-venezuelan-migration-peru.72. KEY MESSAGES • Just over 50 percent of relevant crisis data is available across 14 humanitarian operations. Afghanistan and the Central African Republic have the most complete data, while Venezuela has the least. • The largest data gaps are in the categories for health and education, and food security and nutrition. The categories with the best coverage of data include aﬀected people, and geography and infrastructure. • Partners have made tremendous progress with data sharing and use over the past several years. The Humanitarian Data Exchange platform hosts over 17,000 datasets shared by hundreds of organizations. The data was accessed by over 600,000 users in 2019. • Administrative boundaries and place names are among the most critical datasets for ensuring a shared understanding of location in an operating environment but can be diﬀicult to source and maintain. • Although some data is sensitive and cannot be shared openly, organizations can share the metadata with the underlying data available by request through HDX Connect. This ensures the data is protected from misuse while also increasing transparency and avoiding duplication around what data has been collected. • Reticence risk — the decision not to share data because of uncertainty — can be addressed through secure data sharing techniques and disclosure control processes. • Predictive analytics is an exciting area with the potential to transform how response happens but models can only work based on good data. Data cleaning is the most time consuming part of the modeling process. When feasible, data that has been cleaned for use in models, or the modeled data itself, should be shared on HDX. We call on partners to share or help source the following data that is critical but often missing for many crises: • The location of aﬀected schools (potential sources: national governments, UNICEF, the Education Cluster). • The location of health facilities (potential sources: national governments, WHO). • The authoritative list of populated places with locations (potential sources: national governments, UNFPA). • The authoritative geographic dataset of sub-national administrative divisions (source: national governments). • The location of airports (potential sources: national governments, private sector). • Local transportation routes with an indication of status (potential sources: national governments, WFP , the Logistics Cluster). • Food security data with population by IPC phase and administrative division in an accessible format (potential sources: Fewsnet, IPC partners). • Population living under a defined poverty threshold, aggregated by administrative divisions (potential sources: World Bank, Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative). • Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) rates (potential sources: UNICEF, World Bank, WHO).7 https://twitter.com/humdata The Centre for Humanitarian Data https://centre.humdata.org | Join our mailing list https://bit.ly/humdatamailing | Twitter https://twitter.com/humdata | Email centrehumdata@un.org

While Afghanistan and the Central African Republic have the most relevant and comprehensive data at 63 percent complete, Venezuela has the least at 33 percent complete. Venezuela also has the highest percentage of no data at 41 percent, illustrating the challenge of data collection and sharing in that operation. Health and education is the least complete category at 21 percent, with incomplete data for the location of health and education facilities, and missing data for aﬀected schools. While HDX does include significant data related to health and education statistics, this data is generally at the national level, e.g. one number for the level of primary school enrollment in a country. We do plan to expand the Data Grid in the future to include a sub-category for out-of-school children . We welcome feedback on other relevant data and sources to include. 8 Data on out-of-school rates by country is available on HDX from UNESCO and UNICEF. The Centre has been working to source education in emergency datasets through a partnership with the Education Above All Foundation.

COMPLETENESS BY LOCATION AND SUB-CATEGORY This section provides a closer look at the sub-categories by location. Here we can see that the geography and infrastructure category has no missing data, even if some of the sub-categories are incomplete. This is largely due to the work of OCHA and governments to provide data on administrative boundaries. In cases where this data is incomplete, it may be that the geographic coverage is somehow limited or that the boundaries have not been endorsed as a ‘common operational dataset’ . Within this same category, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap also provides extensive data on points of interest (roads, buildings etc) through its crowd-sourced platform. All other categories have some missing data. 9 https://data.humdata.org/dashboards/cod9 10 https://twitter.com/humdataThe Centre for Humanitarian Data https://centre.humdata.org | Join our mailing list https://bit.ly/humdatamailing | Twitter https://twitter.com/humdata | Email centrehumdata@un.org

CONTRIBUTING ORGANIZATIONS The following 28 organizations share data that is included in the Data Grid. An organization on HDX can be a legal entity or an informal group. Organizations such as WFP and IOM share data (food prices and displacement tracking) across all Data Grid locations. This is also the case for OCHA’s Financial Tracking Service (funding) and ACLED (casualties and conflict events). Other organizations may share a single dataset related to a specific crisis, such as the dataset on the location of schools in Yemen that has been shared by the Education Cluster for that country. Organizations on HDX can be listed as the source or the contributor of the data. The entities listed below have created organizations on HDX and manage their data directly. Although most organizations are both the source and contributor for the data, there are cases where this varies. For instance, as part of its coordination role, OCHA aggregates data on humanitarian needs but the data is collected by multiple partners. With modeled data, the dataset may include multiple sources but the organization that has done the modeling contributes the data. This is often the case with datasets on population estimates, food insecurity and poverty rates.

Some organizations on HDX have one entry for the entire organization, such as IOM. Others have multiple entries for individual field oﬀices, such as OCHA Sudan and OCHA Afghanistan. See more here: https://data.humdata.org/organization1011 The HDX team also manages an HDX organization on the platform for data that it pulls from open data platforms or in cases where the partner would like the data to be shared but does not want to manage the process directly. In these cases, HDX is listed as a contributor but we have not included HDX in the list of contributing organizations. 11 13 https://twitter.com/humdataThe Centre for Humanitarian Data https://centre.humdata.org | Join our mailing list https://bit.ly/humdatamailing | Twitter https://twitter.com/humdata | Email centrehumdata@un.org

DATA FOR MODELING As more data is collected and shared by partners, and as more data scientists enter the humanitarian sector, advanced applications of data to gain insight into operations are becoming commonplace. The push for anticipatory action (responding before a crisis escalates) has brought a growing interest in using data to create predictive models. This might include models to predict food insecurity, cross-border displacement or the impact of a weather event. Models can only work based on reliable, timely and comprehensive data. We encourage data scientists to use the Data Grid as a tool to access the latest data to keep their projections up to date. We also encourage partners to share time series data to help understand the past and to be able to extrapolate future trends. To improve transparency, the Centre is creating a catalogue of predictive models with basic information on ‘who is doing what, where and when’ and whether the model has been peer reviewed. We hope that the catalogue will become the main reference point for information on models in use in the humanitarian sector. We also hope that as more models are developed, the underlying data will be shared through HDX. As we see progress in this area, we may create an additional category in the Data Grid for modelled data. The information in the table below is not comprehensive. If your organization is working on a model, please be in touch with the Centre.

Annex A Affected People Coordination & ContextInternally-Displaced Persons Tabular data of the number of displaced people by location. Locations can be administrative divisions or other locations (such as camps) if an additional dataset defining those locations is also available. Refugees and Persons of Concern Tabular data of the number of refugees and persons of concern either in the country or originating from the country disaggregated by their current location. Locations can be administrative divisions or other locations (such as camps) if an additional dataset defining those locations is also available or if the locations' coordinates are defined in the tabular data. Returnees Tabular data of the number of displaced people who have returned. Humanitarian Profile Locations Vector or tabular data with coordinates representing the locations at which displaced people are gathered. Casualties Number of deaths and/or persons injured, disaggregated by location. Values can be cumulative totals or a time series of new deaths and/or injured persons. Humanitarian Needs Tabular data of the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance by location and humanitarian cluster/sector. 3W - Who is doing what where List of organizations working on humanitarian issues, by humanitarian cluster/sector and disaggregated by administrative division. Aﬀected Areas Vector data or tabular data by administrative division which describe the type and/or severity of impacts geographically. Damaged and Destroyed Buildings Vector data with locations of damaged/destroyed buildings and an indication of damage level or tabular data indicating percentage or total number of buildings in each damage category by administrative divisions. Humanitarian Access Tabular or vector data describing the location of natural hazards, permissions, active fighting, or other access constraints that impact the delivery of humanitarian interventions. Transportation Status Vector or tabular data representing local transportation routes with an indication of status or current practicability. Conflict Events Vector data or tabular data with coordinates describing the location, date, and type of conflict event. Funding Tabular data listing the amount of funding provided by humanitarian cluster/sector. 15CATEGORY SUB-CATEGORY/DEFINITION The Centre for Humanitarian Data https://centre.humdata.org | Join our mailing list https://bit.ly/humdatamailing | Twitter https://twitter.com/humdata | Email centrehumdata@un.org

Food Security & Nutrition Geography & Infrastructure Health & Education Population and Socio-economic IndicatorsCATEGORY SUB-CATEGORY/DEFINITION Food Security Vector data representing the IPC phase classification or tabular data representing population or percentage of population by IPC phase and administrative division. Global Acute Malnutrition Rate Tabular data specifying the global acute malnutrition (GAM) rate by administrative division. Severe Acute Malnutrition Rate Tabular data specifying the severe acute malnutrition (SAM) rate by administrative division. Food Prices Time series prices for common food commodities at a set of location. Administrative Divisions Vector geographic data describing the sub-national administrative divisions of a location, usually a country, including the names and unique identifiers, usually p-codes, of each administrative division. To be considered "complete" , and included here, the humanitarian community working in the location has to have endorsed a preferred set of administrative boundaries as the Common Operational Dataset (COD). Populated Places Vector data or tabular data with coordinates representing the location of populated places (cities, towns, villages). Roads Geographic data describing the location of roads with some indication of the importance of each road segment in the transportation network. The data should exclude or indicate roads that are not usable by typical four-wheel-drive vehicles (footpaths, etc.). Airports Geographic data representing all operational airports including a name or other unique identifier and an indication of what types of aircraft can use each. Health Facilities Vector data or tabular data with coordinates representing health facilities with some indication of the type of facility (clinic, hospital, etc.). Education Facilities Vector data or tabular data with coordinates representing education facilities with some indication of the type of facility (school, university, etc.). Aﬀected Schools Vector data or tabular data with coordinates representing education facilities that have been aﬀected by a crisis with some indication of the nature of the eﬀect and the operational status of each facility. Population Total population aggregated by administrative division. Population by Age and Sex Total population disaggregated age and sex categories, aggregated by administrative division. Poverty Rate Population living under a defined poverty threshold, aggregated by administrative division and represented as a percentage of total population or as an absolute number. 16 https://twitter.com/humdataThe Centre for Humanitarian Data https://centre.humdata.org | Join our mailing list https://bit.ly/humdatamailing | Twitter https://twitter.com/humdata | Email centrehumdata@un.org

ANNEX B All datasets on HDX are evaluated against the following criteria for inclusion in the Data Grid: • Is the data in a common format? We include CSV, XLS, XLSX, SHP , etc. Formats like JSON, geopackage and others that are more diﬀicult for the typical humanitarian data specialist would be marked ‘incomplete. ’ • Is the data tidy? Field names and data rows should be easy to determine. There should not be subtotal rows interspersed with data rows. The required data for the category should be in a single table on the same tab. For tabular data with coordinates, the x and y columns (usually longitude and latitude) should be in decimal degree format and separated into two columns. • Are location references defined? The dataset should contain explicit geographic data (as in GIS data or tabular data with lat/long fields)? If not, the dataset should be joinable to an available dataset that defines those locations. • Is the dataset comprehensive? If the dataset is disaggregated by administrative divisions, does it cover all of them? If it does not, is the meaning of a missing administrative division defined in the metadata? If there is no comprehensive list to compare against (for example with spontaneous displacement locations), does the dataset make it clear if it attempts to be comprehensive or not? This comprehensiveness requirement means that crowd-sourced datasets, like those derived from OpenStreetMap, cannot always be considered complete, even though they may be the most complete dataset available. • Is the dataset up-to-date? The dataset should be the latest available.When a dataset is added to HDX, it may be automatically added to the Data Grid based on its metadata tags. However, within one day an HDX team member will evaluate the dataset to determine if it suﬀiciently meets the criteria to remain in the Data Grid. 17 https://twitter.com/humdataThe Centre for Humanitarian Data https://centre.humdata.org | Join our mailing list https://bit.ly/humdatamailing | Twitter https://twitter.com/humdata | Email centrehumdata@un.org
