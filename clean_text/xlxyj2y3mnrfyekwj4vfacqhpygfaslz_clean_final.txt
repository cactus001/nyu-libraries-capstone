(January 6, 2005) Debate Initiated on the Irregularities in Voting Standards Debate Initiated on the Irregularities in Voting Standards WASHINGTON, DC - Today, on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, debate was initiated on the irregularities in voting standards and procedures during the 2004 elections, specifically in the state of Ohio . President Bush won the state by 118,000 votes and the national contest by over three million votes. However, continuing reports of voter irregularities and intimidation have raised concerns on the reliability of our electoral system. "It is crucial that we continue to hold respect for our nation's democracy and our electoral process. Therefore, it is important to ensure that there is voter fairness, uniform voting procedures and standards, and that our election laws are strictly and justly enforced," stated Lipinski. This afternoon, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 262 to 32 denying the objection to invalidate Ohio 's votes. "In the 109th Congress, I plan to examine ways to protect voter rights in this country and strengthen the integrity and credibility of the electoral process in this country. However, I do not believe the current approach to this problem is the appropriate response or the way to carefully and fully address the important issue of election integrity, "added Lipinski Congressman Daniel Lipinski http://www.lipinski.house.gov Powered by Joomla!
