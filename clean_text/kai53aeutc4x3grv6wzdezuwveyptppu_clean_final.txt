The Forest Service may approve changes to the grazing rotation in consultation with you, to address range condition and situations that may occur due to forage condition or weather related circumstances. 2. Grazing Management It is strongly suggested that liv estock be moved before utilization standards are met. If allowable use levels are met early in the scheduled pasture, ca ttle will be rotated into the next pasture or off the Forest This should prevent non-compliance of standards, allowing for time to clean the unit of stragglers. Monitoring will be conducted to measure utilizatio n of riparian and upland vegetation throughout the grazing year. The following illustrates last year’s rotation: PASTURE ON OFF NUMBER South 10/01/2007 12/31/2007 350 The following illustrates any changes made during the annual Validation Meeting to the 2009 grazing rotation on the allotment. PASTURE ON OFF NUMBER North 11/01/2008 01/31/2009 400 1

Cattle are to be completely removed from a pasture by the off date. I will allow you two weeks prior to the off date to begin movi ng cattle into the next pasture. If two weeks is not adequate, you must request additional time from this office. Please notify this office when you begin to move cattle and when a pasture rotation is complete. Permittees with livestock in rested units, grazing units outside the season of use, and grazing areas not authorized in advance, will be non-complian t with the terms and conditions of their Term Grazing Permit. Appropriate acti on, including billing at the unaut horized use rate, may be taken. Gila National Forest Management Direction Your Term Grazing Permit includes the specific maxi mum allowable utilization levels applicable to your allotment. Allowable use is ca lculated at a point-in-time. To comply with standards in the Gila National Forest Plan, livestock must be moved to another unit or remove th em from National Forest System lands regardless of the time remaining in the grazing season before utiliz ation standards are met. You are responsible for tracking and complying w ith your permitted forage use levels. For your convenience, the South Wahoo C&H Allotment maximum allowable forage utilization levels are listed below: South Wahoo C&H Allotment: The following utilization standards will be applied on the South Wahoo Allotment: • Up to 30% allowable use on all key areas. Range Improvements Range improvements must be maintained to stan dard before cattle are allowed into a pasture. It is the permittee’s responsibility to ensure that range impr ovements remain functional. This includes boundary fences in pastures not currently being grazed. Routine maintenanc e of existing improvements does not require written clearance; howev er, construction/reconstruction of new improvements must be authorized in writing from this office. 2006 Improvement Planned: • We apologize that we were unable to comple te the work on the two dirt tanks that we began last year. At our annual validation meeting we discussed that cleaning out the Bear Tank would be our first priority for grazing year 2006 and we will try and accomplish that work this spring. Completed ⁭ Not Completed ⁭ 2009 Improvements Planned (Work or Supplie s Needed from 2006 and New Projects) __Bear Tank Possible EQIP Project for 2009 __________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________When improvements have been maintained, please call the Black Range Ranger Station and report that maintenance has been completed. If verification is not received from the permittee, 2

inspections will be made. During that inspection, if we find maintenance has not been completed, and livestock are grazing an area unscheduled for use at the time, they will be considered unauthorized. Permittees may be billed for unau thorized use and/or permit action taken for maintenance. All water developments must provide access and escape to and from water for all types of wildlife. Please contact the Kameron or Shane for assistance. Monitoring Key areas for monitoring are identified as riparian areas and transect cluster locations. Additional key areas may be identified during th e season based on routine monitoring. The idea of a key area is to find a site that is repr esentative of a larger area in which cattle obtain the majority of their required forage resources. Key ar ea monitoring will avoid areas directly adjacent to permanent water sources, cattle tr ails, roads, and fence lines. Upland areas will be monitored for use on perennial grass species. District personnel will contact the pe rmittees to coordinate site visits to monitor key areas. Permittee participation is encouraged. Forage utilization estim ates will be consistent with the Forest Service Range Analysis Handbook methodology, and may also incl ude FS Regional stubble-height standards, as well as other techniques generally accepte d in the field of range management. Special Management Instructions he following restrictions will be implemented so that management remains in compliance with the Endangered Species Act. The instru ctions below relate to threaten ed, endangered, and proposed to be listed species as well as range/watershed conditions. • There are no documentations that identify any protected and restricted Mexican Spotted Owl habitat on the South Wahoo Allotment, therefore th ere are no restrictions regarding the Mexican Spotted Owl. • Stock tanks must be surveyed fo r possible aquatic habitat before earth-disturbing maintenance is authorized. • The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Chir icahua leopard frog as a threatened species in We have completed grazing consultation on your allotment regarding the effects of livestock grazing on the Chiricahua leopard frog . We determined that livestock grazing will either have no effect or will not adversely affect the Chiricahua leopard frog. As a result of this determination, there were no changes required of your grazing permit. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concurred with this determination. Therefore, consultation has been completed. A copy of this consultation is on file with your local Ranger District. The Endangered Species Act requires that actions f unded or carried out by the federal government go through the consultation process to insure these actions do not jeopardi ze the continued existence of a listed species. Please notify this office of any planned earth disturbing ac tivities involving riparian areas, dirt tanks, or other sources of open water. 3
