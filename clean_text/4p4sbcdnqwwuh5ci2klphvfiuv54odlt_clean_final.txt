Streptococcus iniae is an emerging zoonotic pathogen; such infections generally occur through injuries associated with preparing whole fresh ﬁ sh for cooking. Those infected to date have been of Asian descent, are usually elderly (av-erage age 68 years), and have had >1 underlying condi-tions that may predispose them to infection. Studies of the foundations of growth characteristics of S. iniae and its in- teractions with piscine host cells have recently been com-plemented by molecular studies. Advances in molecular biology have allowed research groups to identify numerous virulence factors and to explore their roles in the progres-sion of S. iniae infection. Many of these virulence factors are homologous to those found in the major human pathogen S. pyogenes. An increased understanding of the properties of these factors and their effect on the success of infection is leading to novel approaches to control S. iniae infection; in particular, vaccination programs at ﬁ sh farms have reduced the reservoir of infection for additional clinical cases. Streptococcus iniae is a major ﬁ sh pathogen in many regions of the world. These bacteria are also zoonotic with infections in humans associated with the handling and preparation of infected ﬁ sh. The ﬁ rst human infections were reported in 1996 ( 1), and S. iniae was noted as an emerging zoonotic disease transmitted by food animals at the International Conference on Emerging Infectious Dis-eases in 2000 ( 2). Human infections with S. iniae have been sporadic but continue to be reported with new cases arising in 2009 ( 3). Reports of these cases are likely to increase be- cause of enhanced awareness, more reliable detection and identi ﬁ cation methods, and the global expansion of ﬁ nﬁ sh aquaculture. Most cases of human S. iniae infections have been in persons of Asian descent, who are elderly and com-monly have >1 underlying conditions such as diabetes mel-litus, chronic rheumatic heart disease, cirrhosis, or other conditions ( 1,3–7). Carrier ﬁ sh have been implicated in ﬁ sh-to- ﬁ sh trans- mission of S. iniae (8), and these carriers may be responsi- ble for human infection because ﬁ sh with overt signs of dis- ease are unmarketable. Soft tissue injuries that occur during the preparation of fresh ﬁ sh from wet markets usually result in bacteremic cellulitis of the hand, followed by >1 of these conditions: endocarditis, meningitis, arthritis, sepsis, pneu-monia, osteomyelitis, and toxic shock ( 7). Infections are treated with a course of antimicrobial drugs such as peni-cillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cloxacillin, cefazolin, and/or gentamicin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethox-azole over a period of 1 to several weeks, depending on the nature of the infection ( 3–5,9). S. iniae is not currently as- signed to any Lance ﬁ eld group and is β-hemolytic on blood agar, with some clinical strains isolated from Asia being more mucoid than others ( 6). Underreporting of human cases is likely because iden- tiﬁ cation of S. iniae is based on biochemical testing of iso- lates with commercial kits; the use of kits is associated with problems because S. iniae is not listed in commercial or clinical databases, and many atypical strains are assigned low matches ( 1,4). According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (www.aihw.gov.au), between 1999–2000 and 2006–2007, a total of 2,824 cases of “other” or “unspeci ﬁ ed” streptococcal sepsis required hospitalization in Australia that were attributed to nongroup A, B, or C streptococci, or S. pneumoniae, and 2,026 cases were in persons >50 years of age. During the same period, the trend in the number of cases per year attributable to other or un-speciﬁ ed streptococci has been upward, rising from a total of 278 cases in 1999–2000 to 430 in 2006–2007 (155% increase). In the >50 years age group, this upward trend is more pronounced, with a 168% increase in cases requiring hospitalization. It is therefore probable that some cases of S. iniae infection in Australia in the at-risk age group have Towards Control of Streptococcus iniae Justice C.F. Baiano and Andrew C.

SYNOPSIS been misidenti ﬁ ed. Misidenti ﬁ cation of S. iniae infection is likely to be the main reason for low levels of detection because most cases of this emerging pathogen are detected during retrospective studies speci ﬁ cally targeting S. iniae . This ﬁ nding is likely to be the case in countries around the world that have reported outbreaks in ﬁ sh farms, but no human cases to date. Molecular-based detection and iden-tiﬁ cation methods have recently been developed (informa- tion on this aspect of identi ﬁ cation can be found in a recent review by Agnew and Barnes) and these will lead to im-proved reporting in future years ( 10). Observations on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of S. iniae infections are still ongoing; however, valuable information on the differentiation of strains (as being ei-ther commensal or pathogenic) has bene ﬁ tted research. Because of the lack of potential virulence factors or phe-notypic differences between commensal and pathogenic strains, pulsed- ﬁ eld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis showed that differences existed between human clinical isolates and those from ﬁ sh surfaces ( 1). The human clinical isolates showed little variation between one another, while considerable differences were found between the 2 Ameri-can Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) dolphin strains and 32 other ﬁ sh isolates. It was determined that some unknown factors important to pathogenicity were not present in all strains ( 1). Little variation has also been found between clinical strains from the United States and Canada, although 1 strain from Pennsylvania had a PFGE pattern similar to the type strain ( 11), and 2 clinical isolates from Hong Kong were unrelated to a strain from Canada ( 4). In a PFGE study of isolates from Australia, similarities between ﬁ sh pathogenic isolates and human clinical isolates from North America, in addition to multiple genotypes between and within different ﬁ sh farms, were reported ( 12). Another PFGE study of strains from a variety of species of diseased ﬁ sh in the People’s Republic of China found that there were 17 genotypes from 27 strains clustering into 5 major groups (13). As with the study from Australia, multiple genotypes were found between and within different farms. Clinical isolates from the United States were able to multiply by 2 to 5 generations in 3 hours in fresh human blood; however, 2 isolates from Canada were able to sur-vive, but not multiply, in human blood ( 11). Resistance to phagocytic killing in whole blood by pathogenic strains of S. iniae contrasted with isolates identi ﬁ ed as commensal strains that were susceptible ( 9). The pathogenic strain 9117 (a human clinical isolate causing cellulitis) caused weight loss in experimentally infected mice and was highly cellu-lytic to human brain microvessel endothelial cell (BMEC) monolayers and invasive of Hep-2 cells. However, adher-ence to, and invasion of, BMEC cells by strain 9117 was lower than that for commensal strain 9066 (obtained in a swab sample from a healthy ﬁ sh) ( 9). In a similar study, pathogenic strains were more resistant to oxidative burst activity in macrophages ( 14). The mode of invasion of S. iniae was studied in skin epithelial cell monolayers of rainbow trout viewed under polarized light ( 15). S. iniae adhered to, then invaded epi- thelial cells, but its persistence and replication inside the cells was short-lived. However, transcytosis from epithe-lial cells occurred within 30 minutes of contact without damaging the cells or cellular junctions ( 15). Once the epithelial cell layer had been breached, dissemination throughout the ﬁ sh through internalization in macrophag- es can occur. By inducing macrophage death, this process is one of the most ef ﬁ cient ways of transporting the infec- tion into the brain ( 15,16). Recent molecular research into factors that contribute to the virulence of S. iniae has identi ﬁ ed several candi- dates, including surface proteins, capsular polysaccharides, and extracellular secreted products (Figure). Moreover, the recent sequencing of the complete genome of S. iniae will accelerate the discovery of additional virulence factors and lead to identi ﬁ cation of targets for effective vaccines for farmed ﬁ sh, thus reducing the potential for zoonotic infec- tion. In light of the recent rapid increase in our knowledge of this emerging pathogen, we will present a synopsis of the processes involved in infection that have been eluci-dated to date. Virulence Factors SiM Protein M proteins are one of the major virulence factors in group A streptococci ( S. pyogenes ; GAS). The high level of diversity of emm gene types (a hypervariable gene encod- ing the M protein) has contributed to the success of GAS in causing infections in humans. The M-like protein from S. iniae , SiM, is also a prime candidate in virulence ( 17,18). The SiM protein is a coiled-coil protein that has a molecu-lar mass of ≈53 kDa, although 2 other variants, one with a 1-aa insertion between the coils and another with a much larger mass of ≈59 kDa, have also been described ( 17). An additional variant had a natural frameshift/premature termi-nation of the SiMA1 type in a strain from an infected tilapia (18). All SiM proteins possess the classical gram-positive membrane anchor motif LPXTG, and although they have several repeat motifs in the coil regions, they are not in tan-dem as in M proteins from other species. In common with M proteins from S. pyogenes , S. equi, and S. dysgalactiae , SiM protein is a surface protein that binds human ﬁ brino- gen to protect the bacterium from phagocytic activity ( 17). SiM proteins may also bind trout immunoglobulin by the Fc region ( 19). An allelic exchange study showed that SiM protein is a major virulence factor of S. iniae , contributes to adherence to ﬁ sh epithelial cells ( 18), and also con ﬁ rmed 1892 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009

Control of S. iniae earlier observations that SiM contributes to macrophage resistance ( 17). The SiM protein genes, simA and simB , are likely to be regulated by a multigene regulatory protein, Mgx, that is homologous to the Mga protein found in GAS ( 17). There are sequence elements upstream of the simA and simB genes that are similar to DNA binding sites described for Mga. The ﬁ nding of a second mga-like element ( mgx2 ) immedi- ately downstream of mgx in a tilapia brain abscess isolate may represent part of an alternative virulence strategy ( 18). C5a Peptidase C5a peptidase hydrolyses the neutrophil chemoattrac- tant complement factor C5a ( 18) and thus impairs the abil- ity of the infected host to ﬁ ght the infection. C5a peptidase is a surface protein with a LPXTN gram-positive anchor motif ( 18). In GAS, C5a peptidase is found in culture su- pernatants; however, this observation has not been made for S. iniae (18). In S. iniae , C5a peptidase is a 123-kDa pro- tein, encoded by scpI, with similar structural features and conserved residue positions to the GAS counterpart ( 18). C5a peptidase may have arisen in S. iniae by horizontal gene transfer, given its close proximity to a transposase and similar genetic organization found in GAS ( 18). Notably, allelic exchange has shown that this protein by itself is not required for virulence in ﬁ sh and its role in pathogenesis is likely a minor one ( 18). Interleukin-8 Protease Interleukin-8 ( IL-8) is produced in the host in response to stimuli such as lipopolysaccharides, viruses, and other cytokines. IL-8 protease is a cell envelope protease that is able to degrade the chemokine IL-8 and results in increased neutrophil resistance and disease dissemination ( 20). It is encoded by the cepI gene, resulting in a 1,631-aa protein with a C-terminal LPXTG gram-positive anchor motif and is homologous to the cepA gene in GAS ( 20). Streptolysin S The ability of S. iniae to hemolyse erythrocytes and damage host cell membranes results from the activity of cytolysins ( 21). The cytolysin possessed by S. iniae is homologous to streptolysin S (SLS) from GAS ( 21) and affects erythrocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and some tissue types in tissue culture ( 22), but does not have roles in phagocytic resistance nor epithelial cell adherence and invasion ( 23). Nine genes in the sag operon are involved in SLS formation; these share 73% homology with GAS SLS genes ( 21). The number of genes and their genetic order are identical in both microorganisms ( 21). The sagA gene encodes a peptide that is 73% identical to the sagA protein from GAS, and the sagB gene encodes a protein with 77% identity to the sagB protein from GAS, which is predicted to use ﬂ avin mononucleotide as a cofactor ( 21). The sagC-F genes are similar to their counterpart genes in GAS, and the sagG-I genes encode ATP binding cassette-type (ABC) transport systems ( 21). Other sequence features, such as in- verted repeats between the sagA and sagB genes and after the sagI gene, have similarities with GAS sag operon genes (21). All genes in the operon are required to produce SLS as knockout of sagB in S. iniae caused loss of hemolytic activity ( 21). Likewise, when the S. iniae sagA gene was transformed into a nonhemolytic allelic mutant strain of GAS (NZ131 sagA∆cat), the S. iniae version of the sagA gene restored hemolytic activity ( 21,23). The cytotoxic properties of SLS toward ﬁ sh cells and the likely promo- tion of cerebrovascular trauma represent a major virulence factor in the pathogenesis of S. iniae (23). The sagA gene in S. iniae is regulated by a 2-compo- nent signal transduction system called sivS/R (24). sivS/R regulates virulence in vivo because no deaths occurred in Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1893 Figure. Virulence factors of Streptococcus iniae . A diagrammatic representation of a cell of S. iniae showing the regulatory genes involved in virulence factor expression (inside cell) and the virulence factors on the outside of the cell. In a clockwise direction, SiM protein ( simA ) expression is likely to be regulated by mgx. SiM protein binds immunoglobulin (Ig) and ﬁ brinogen. C5a peptidase and interleukin-8 (IL-8) protease degrade their respective chemokines to impair phagocyte signaling. Production of the cytolysin streptolysin S ( sag; SLS) is regulated by the sivS/R system. SLS lyses lymphocytes (L), erythrocytes (E), and neutrophils (N). The CAMP factor gene, cﬁ , is also regulated by sivS/R and is known to bind immunoglobulin by the Fc region. Capsular polysaccharide (cpsA ; CPS) synthesis is controlled by sivS/R and is represented by a haze around the cell. Exopolysaccharide (EPS) is produced in excess and contributes to highly viscous growth. α–enolase degrades ﬁ brin clots and promotes dissemination.

SYNOPSIS a mouse infection model when mice were infected with a deletion mutant of pathogenic strain 9117 (9117 ∆siv) compared with 75% deaths when mice were infected with the wild type strain ( 24). In the siv deletion mutant, sagA expression was decreased by 3-fold. sivS/R also regulates the expression of surface proteins, including a lipoprotein/ABC transporter homologous to Spy1228, pyruvate kinase, and a hyaluronate-associated protein homologous to that from S. equi or an ABC transporter from S. agalactiae (24). However, the role for these proteins in a virulence setting is hitherto unknown in S. iniae . CAMP Factor The pore-forming toxin CAMP factor synergistically acts with sphingomylinase-producing Staphylococcus au- reus to produce a distinct arrow-shaped area of complete lysis of erythrocytes on sheep blood agar ( 24). CAMP factor has also been shown to bind immunoglobulin by the Fc region and therefore contributes to virulence ( 24). S. iniae harbors a CAMP factor–like gene, cﬁ , (24) that encodes a peptide of ≈27 kDa and shares 62% identity with cfa from GAS that is regulated by the sivS/R sys- tem. Knockout mutants of the sivS/R system resulted in a reduced lytic reaction, and real-time PCR analysis of cﬁ gene expression showed it was expressed at only 10% of wild-type levels ( 24). Immunoglobulin-Binding Proteins A putative protein G-like protein, a cell wall associ- ated protein ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed from group G streptococci ( ≈70 kDa), from S. iniae was capable of binding trout immuno- globulin only when grown in the presence of trout serum (19). Proteins of ≈35 kDa, ≈70 kDa, and >100 kDa were found to bind trout immunoglobulin. The size of one of the detected bands >100 kDa is similar in size to the tetramer formation of SiM proteins ( 17); however, experimental evidence is needed to con ﬁ rm this. CAMP factor is also known to bind immunoglobulin ( 24). Capsule One of the most effective ways for a bacterium to avoid phagocytosis is by the production of capsular polysaccha-ride (CPS), and strains with CPS are more virulent than their unencapsulated counterparts ( 25–27). The presence of capsule is also involved in inhibiting complement C3 de-position ( 27). Miller and Neely ( 27) used signature tagged mutagenesis to identify virulence genes using a zebra ﬁ sh (Danio rerio ) model. Five attenuated mutants with unique insertions in polysaccharide synthesis genes with homol-ogy to those found in S. thermophilus plus 2 additional clones with insertions in a homologous gene near capsule synthesis genes from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were found. In contrast to the wild-type strain 9117, these mu-tants aggregated in broth culture with chain lengths up to 4× longer than the wild type. Differences in buoyancy due to degree of encapsulation showed that the production of excess capsule is likely to be as detrimental to survival as too little capsule ( 27). The capsule operon of S. iniae is ≈21 kb in size and consists of 21 open reading frames ( 28). The genes have homology to genes found in other streptococci such as S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. suis, and S. thermophilus (28). An insertion sequence, IS 981, was found between cpsL and cpsM in strain 9117 ( 28). cpsY (78% identity to CpsY in GAS) precedes cpsA and is transcribed in the opposite direction and is thought to be the promoter of the capsule operon (as well as other virulence genes) because it has a high level of homology to the LysR transcriptional regu-lators ( 28). A major difference was found in the operons from the virulent strain 9117 and commensal strain 9066 with strain 9066 having an ≈10-kb deletion missing the genes cpsF-L and orf276, orf193 , and orf151 . In addition, the cpsM gene in the commensal strain 9066 was truncated with the ﬁ rst 154 nt being absent, which casts doubt on the functionality of the gene ( 28). The genes cpsA-E are responsible for the length of the monosaccharide sugar chains and their export ( 29,30). The central region of the operon from cpsF to cpsL con- tains several genes encoding glycosyl transferases, which have a role in the polymerization of the capsule chain ( 28). This region is where most mutations in the virulent strain 9117 were found to play a role in pathogenesis ( 27) and is the same region where the deleted genes in the com- mensal strain 9066 occurred ( 28). The G + C content of the operon genes varies widely from 22% to 40% ( 28). The cpsF-L region has a G + C content of ≈27%, which is lower than that found for other S. iniae sequences and may indicate horizontal acquisition from other members of the Firmicutes (28). Mutations in cpsA in strain 9117 resulted in long chain formation, aggregation of cells in broth culture and high buoyancy characteristic of reduced encapsulation ( 28). The cpsA mutant was attenuated in both brain and heart tissues. A cpsY mutant was slightly less encapsulated than the wild type and was attenuated only in heart tissue ( 28). Allelic exchange of the cpsD gene resulted in reduced capsule, increased chain length, a marked decrease in all capsular monosaccharides, and a high degree of attenua-tion ( 31). cpsD encodes an autophosphorylating tyrosine kinase thought to be responsible for capsule polymerization and export ( 31). cpsD mutants were able to bind more ef- fectively to host tissues, such as epithelial cells, due to loss of overall negative charge ( 31). Insertions in the cpsH and cpsM genes have resulted in underproduction of capsule and overproduction of capsule, respectively ( 28).

Control of S. iniae and orf276 of strain NUF631 resulted in attenuation, which was measured by increased chemiluminescence response of macrophages and loss of acidic polysaccharides ( 26). Like CAMP factor and streptolysin S, the 2-component system sivS/R is involved in transcriptional regulation of the capsular operon ( 32). Phosphoglucomutase Also involved in capsular biosynthesis is phosphoglu- comutase, a 571-aa protein encoded by pgmA that intercon- verts glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate ( 33). Transposon mutagenesis of the promoter region upstream of pgmA resulted in a highly attenuated mutant that was more susceptible to whole blood killing ( 33). This suscepti- bility was attributed to a decrease in the amount of exopoly-saccharide capsule on the cell surface, decreased negative charge, and a larger cell volume 3–5× that of the wild type. Increased susceptibility to the pore-forming cationic antimi-crobial peptide moronecidin was also reported, most likely due to changes in cell wall architecture because of increased cellular volume and a decrease in cell wall rigidity ( 33). Exopolysaccharide The quantitative composition of monosaccharides present in exopolysaccharide (EPS) is distinct from those found in CPS ( 34). The routine vaccination of ﬁ sh in Israel has given rise to new strains of S. iniae responsible for mass ﬁ sh deaths ( 34). These new strains were formed when an autogenous vaccine strain, KFP404, was succeeded by new strains KFP468, KFP477, and KFP523, which were char-acterized by a viscous broth culture similar to that observed with S. thermophilus used in yoghurt production ( 34). EPS production by the successor strains was 5× higher than the autogenous vaccine strain. Vaccination of ﬁ sh with the EPS extracts elicited a survival rate of 78%, which was similar to the 72% survival rate when whole cells were used. Thus, EPS appears to be antigenic and excessive production may have been selected by vaccination ( 34). α-Enolase The ability of S. iniae to cross tissues through plasmino- gen activation is facilitated by α-enolase ( 35), which is also a known contributory factor to the virulence of GAS ( 36). The proteolytic activity of plasmin in dissolving ﬁ brin clots enables pathogens to migrate faster through extracellular matrices ( 37), and α-enolase expedites invasion through the host tissues ( 38) and, ultimately, into the circulatory system. The α-enolase from S. iniae (≈50 kDa) is a plasmin/plasmi- nogen binding enzyme that is 97% similar to the α-enolases of S. agalactiae and GAS ( 35). Immunoblot using antibodies raised against the puri ﬁ ed recombinant protein showed cell wall association in S. iniae ; however, it does not contain the classical gram-positive membrane anchor.Conclusions S. iniae opportunistically infects elderly persons with serious underlying conditions. The expression of a suite of virulence factors, many of them similar to those found in GAS, is responsible for successful entry, propagation, and evasion of immune defenses of the host by this bacterium. Another virulence factor, polysaccharide deacetylase, en-coded by the pdi gene, has been recently described ( 39). With the global rise of aquaculture and the dependence on it to provide food in many areas of the world, the numbers of cases of S. iniae infection are likely to be much higher than currently reported and will increase in the future with the expansion of the industry. Understanding the pathogenic processes of S. iniae is already facilitating the development of vaccines for use in ﬁ sh farms and represents the most sustainable and effective method of reducing the incidence of economically devastating outbreaks and clinical presen-tations in humans, especially in those most at risk.

Adaptive mutations that have contributed to the emer- gence of in ﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, which can replicate and transmit among humans, remain unknown. We conducted a large-scale scanning of in ﬂ uenza protein sequences and identi ﬁ ed amino acid–conserving positions that are speci ﬁ c to host species, called signatures. Of 47 sig- natures that separate avian viruses from human viruses by their nonglycoproteins, 8 were human-like in the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. Close examination of their amino acid residues in the recent ancestral swine viruses of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus showed that 7 had already transitioned to human-like residues and only PA 356 retained an avian-like K; in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, this residue changed into a human-like R. Signatures that separate swine viruses from human viruses were also present. Continuous monitor-ing of these signatures in nonhuman species will help with inﬂ uenza surveillance and with evaluation of the likelihood of further adaptation to humans. A recent outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, previously known as the swine-origin in ﬂ uenza A, has infected >296,000 persons worldwide; 3,486 deaths have been re-ported ( 1). An increased number of infected humans can potentially alter virulence in the human population. The genomic sequences of many of the new strains of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus have revealed important information for promoting medical diagnosis, drug-resistance monitor-ing, clinical and basic research, and vaccine development. Nevertheless, analyzing adaptive mutation of the new pan-demic (H1N1) 2009 virus is a priority so that researchers can evaluate the likelihood that viruses from other nonhu-man species will further adapt to humans. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus consists of multiple re- assorted virus genes from different origins. Of its 8 seg-mented genomic RNAs, 2 polymerase genes, PB2 and PA, were from the avian virus of North American lineage and were introduced into swine populations around 1998. The other polymerase gene, PB1, also evolved recently from a human seasonal in ﬂ uenza (H3N2) virus around the same year. This particular H3N2 PB1 gene is known to have originated from an avian virus that entered humans in 1968. However, hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), and nonstructural (NS) protein genes of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus descended directly from the classic swine in-ﬂ uenza A virus of North American lineage, which can be traced back to the 1918 virus. Originating from the Eur-asian swine virus, the remaining 2 genes, neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M), were introduced from birds around 1979 ( 2,3). Limited information is available as to how this unique combination of gene segments evolved from 1998 until it was identi ﬁ ed in April 2009 or on the molecular transitions or evolutionary path of this virus before it was transmitted among humans. Our previous study developed an entropy-based com- putational scheme to identify host-speci ﬁ c genomic signa- tures of human and avian in ﬂ uenza viruses ( 4). This method is based on an entropy threshold computed from the amino acid composition at the well known PB2-627 position of avian in ﬂ uenza viruses (entropy value of 0.4 was based on 95 avian in ﬂ uenza genomes, as of early 2006), which contains mostly glutamic acid in the native avian hosts of the viruses. This threshold was then used to identify the 52 species-associated positions at which each of the 2 viruses settles as a distinct amino acid residue that is characteristic of the host. Although the origin of the gene segments in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus has been determined ( 2,3), the mechanism of transformation of the host-speci ﬁ c ami-Genomic Signatures of In ﬂ uenza A Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus Guang-Wu Chen and Shin-Ru Shih Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1897 Author af ﬁ liation: Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Re- public of China DOI: 10.3201/eid1512.090845

RESEARCH no acid signatures is unclear, because the new viral genes evolved after they were introduced into the swine popula-tion some years ago. By adopting the entropy pro ﬁ ling approach, this study attempts to update in ﬂ uenza A viral signatures on the ba- sis of all in ﬂ uenza sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). In addition to provid-ing an updated list of human-avian signatures, this study also computes the human-swine signatures and analyzes the amino acid sequences of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus at the host species–speci ﬁ c positions to elucidate the adap- tive mutation of in ﬂ uenza A viruses in these host species. As more new in ﬂ uenza virus isolates are collected and their sequences analyzed, the signatures at the host species–speciﬁ c positions serve as predictors of adaptive mutation, subsequently providing valuable information to help in pre-paring for potential pandemics. Materials and Methods Inﬂ uenza Virus Sequences All in ﬂ uenza A virus protein sequences from the NCBI, as of May 28, 2009, were downloaded and analyzed. These full-length or partial sequences were grouped according to the hosts from which the viruses were isolated: humans, avian, and swine. In particular, to observe how these virus-es vary in terms of residues, the newly deposited pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus sequences were considered separately from the human isolates. For each host-speci ﬁ c group, se- quences belonging to each viral protein were aligned using the program ClustalW ( 5). Based on the proposed signature identi ﬁ cation procedure, 2 surface proteins, HA and NA, were not analyzed because their extensive genetic diversity prevents satisfactory multiple alignment within either hu-man or avian viruses. As an alternatively translated protein product from the PB1 gene, PB1-F2 is also not included in the analysis because it terminates prematurely at position 12. For each of the 4 groups of data, i.e., human, avian, swine, and pandemic (H1N1) 2009, eight alignments were analyzed: PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2. The total number of sequences varied from gene to gene and from host to host, subject to their availability at the NCBI. For human-isolated viruses (excluding strains of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus), >3,000 sequences of the 8 proteins were analyzed. For avian-isolated, swine-isolated, and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses, the numbers of sequences were ≈3,500, 350, and 70, respectively. Recent Ancestors of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Viruses Smith et al. ( 6) performed evolutionary analysis of the early development of the pandemic, indicating that spo-radic infection of humans with triple reassortant and other subsequent reassortant swine viruses occurred before the 2009 human outbreak. To elucidate the transition of amino acid residues along this evolutionary course, we collected and analyzed the protein sequences of 18 recent ancestral swine viruses of the new H1N1 viruses (hereinafter termed “recent ancestral swine viruses”) for 1999–2009 from the ancestral lineages of the new pandemic (H1N1) 2009 strains. The sampling was based on the phylogenetic trees published in a study by Smith et al. ( 6). Although a number of swine virus origins have been reported, resulting in vari-ous genetic lineages and subtypes, we are most interested in identifying a swine virus population from which the current pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus might have evolved directly. Not only are those 18 strains chronologically closer (after the years 1997–1998) to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses but their PB2 and PA genes are also descendants of avian viruses, which complies with the conclusion drawn from recent publications. The online Appendix Table, available from http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1897-appT.htm, summarizes the strain names and accession numbers of recent ancestral swine viruses included in this study. Entropy-based Signature Identi ﬁ cation For each amino acid position of the aligned sequences of the same virus type, i.e., avian, human, swine, or pan-demic (H1N1) 2009, an entropy value was computed by using the formula – ΣP i × ln( Pi), as described by Chen et al. (4). This formula follows the de ﬁ nition of Shannon entropy (7) that has been used to evaluate the diversity of a system. In this study, an entropy was used to measure the variabil-ity of aligned amino acid residues at a given genomic posi-tion, where i = 1 to 20 represents 20 different amino acid residues, and P i represents the probability density of the respective residue. An entropy value ranges from 0 (only 1 residue present at that position) to 2.996 (all 20 residues are equally represented). As is assumed, a position at which the entropy is less than or equal to a prespeci ﬁ ed threshold has a consensus residue for that virus type. When viruses iso-lated from 2 host species are compared, a species-speci ﬁ c signature position is considered to have different consensus amino acid residue from each of the 2 viruses at the same position. In this study, an entropy threshold of 0.33 was used, based on the PB2-627 position of 3,391 avian in ﬂ u- enza sequences. Results In 2006, we reported 52 avian-human signatures based on a small set of in ﬂ uenza sequence data of 15,785 protein sequences. The selection was based on an entropy thresh-old value of 0.4 set at position 627 in the PB2 gene (82 Es and 13 Ks from 95 avian PB2 sequences) because that po-sition has been considered associated with host-restriction (8–11 ). Of the 52 positions, 45 are in the genes PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2 examined in this work. 1898 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009

Genomic Signatures of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus Today, >100,000 in ﬂ uenza protein sequences are available at NCBI, and a new entropy threshold of 0.33 was set based on the currently available avian sequences of PB2-627, which contain 3,113 Es, 228 Ks, 46 Vs, 2 As, and 2 Gs. This threshold was adopted to update the list of 47 avian-human signatures in Table 1 for the 8 proteins of interest. Consistent with our earlier ﬁ ndings, most signatures are located on the NP gene (15 positions), followed in number by PA (10 positions), PB2 (9 positions), M2 (5 positions), M1 (3 positions), PB1 (2 positions), NS2 (2 positions), and NS1 (1 position).

RESEARCH from the 2006 list because their entropy values (0.490 and 404, respectively) exceeded the 0.4 threshold, based on the 95 avian sequences examined at that time. New entries in Table 1 also include PA-100, M2-93, and NS1-81. In 2006, although PB2-674 was reported as a signature, it is disquali ﬁ ed here because the entropy of 0.3376 (3,146 As, 88 Es, 87 Ts, 38 Ss, 13 Gs, 4 Vs, and 1 K for avian virus) exceeds the new 0.33 threshold at this position. Similarly, PA-382 (2,421 Ds, 311 Es, 2 Vs, and 1 N in human viruses, with an entropy of 0.3633) and NS2-70 (2,898 Ss, 352 Gs, 28 Rs, and 1 D in avian viruses, with an entropy of 0.3483) were both removed from the 2006 list. Taubenberger et al. ( 12) identi ﬁ ed 10 polymerase gene positions that separate avian viruses from human in ﬂ uenza A viruses. Table 1 shows 8 of them (PB2 199, 475, 567, 627, and 702; PA 55, 100, and 552), suggesting that the method is robust in ﬁ nding these signatures. Two other polymerase gene positions that Taubenberger et al. also reported are PB1-375 and PA-382; the latter has already been mentioned above. The other missing position in Table 1, PB1-375, has an entropy value of 0.8865 for human and 0.6338 for avian viruses. This position was also excluded from the 2006 list because of an entropy of 0.698 from avi-an viruses, which substantially exceeded the 0.4 threshold. To elucidate the potential adaptive mutations of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses, we studied the amino acid sequences of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses at the posi-tions that represent the so-called species-speci ﬁ c signatures of avian and human viruses. As shown in to the last column of Table 1, 36 of the 47 positions display avian-like signa-tures in the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. Two positions, PB2-588 and NP-313, exhibit neither avian- nor human-like signatures. Eight human-like signatures were found in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 strains, except for NS1-227, in which all new viruses have an early-terminating NS1 pro-tein and, therefore, contain no residue. Table 1 presents the updated avian-human signatures for in ﬂ uenza A viruses; Table 2 summarizes the swine- human signatures. Medical literature documents that the swine virus population has distinct evolutionary lineages that originated from the classic 1918 virus referred to as classic or North American swine virus, and the others of post-1979 Eurasian swine virus and subsequent triple reas-sortants. Because the residue diversity at many positions markedly increased for these swine viruses because of their distinct origins, only 8 swine-human signatures met the 0.33 threshold. Unlike some positions in which human-like signatures of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were found (Table 1), in this study, all 8 locations of the swine-human signature of this new virus are characteristic of swine. No-tably, Table 1 lists all 8 positions in Table 2, with each hav-ing the same signature as in the avian virus. Restated, avian and swine viruses contain the same amino acid residue at the 8 human-swine signature positions. We attempted to further elucidate the transition of the amino acid residue on the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus that have human signatures by sampling 18 recent ancestral swine viruses (online Appendix Table). Doing so enables us to examine more closely the prevalence of amino acid residues speci ﬁ cally with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses. Table 3 summarizes the amino acid statistics of these re-cent ancestral swine viruses together with avian, human, and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 sequences at the 8 positions containing human residues for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vi-rus in Table 1. Consider PB2-271, for example, avian vi-ruses have signature T, whereas human viruses have signa-ture A. Although pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses also have the human signature A, their predecessors, i.e., the recent ancestral swine viruses, have already acquired the human signature A at this position. PB1-336, along with PA-409, NP-33, -100, -305, and -357, follows the same residue tran-sition, all showing human-characteristic residues in both recent ancestral swine and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses. PA-356 is the only exception, where the residue in recent ancestral swine viruses still maintains an avian-character-istic K before changing to a human residue R in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses. Of particular interest is whether the transition from K to R at position PA-356 is responsible for the ability of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses to replicate and transmit ef ﬁ ciently in humans.

Genomic Signatures of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus PB1, PA, and NP protein genes, all amino acid positions of these 4 proteins were scanned for their residue transi-tions among the 4 virus populations shown in Table 3. The change in the amino acid that may be associated with the transformation of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus is sum-marized in Table 4. As well as PA-356, already shown in Table 2, two additional positions, PB2-684 and PA-204, showed the same dominant amino acid residue in avian and recent ancestral swine viruses, but a different domi-nant residue in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses and human viruses. Dominance is de ﬁ ned here as 1 residue containing the largest sequence count compared with other residues at a particular aligned position. The previously used entropy measurement in Tables 1, 2, and 3 does not apply to the positions listed in Table 4, in which we emphasize the ami-no acid transition of dominant residues instead of highly conserved ones subject to the prescribed entropy threshold 0.33. Other than those 3 positions, PB1-216 was found to contain a human residue G in 8 of 9 recent ancestral swine viruses that are closer to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses in the phylogenetic tree published in a study by Smith et al. (6). However, for the other 7 recent ancestors that are more distant from pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses, PB1- 216 maintains an avian-residue S in 6 of 7 viruses. Our results show that the position-speci ﬁ c transition may serve as a molecular marker for monitoring such adaptive muta-tions in the future. Discussion Although most studies confer that the death rate as- sociated with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection is more moderate than that of subtype H5N1 infection, its virulence may vary with adaptive mutations in viral genes, subse-quently increasing the likelihood that the new virus alters its virulence in the new host species. Many of the previous-ly identi ﬁ ed virulence factors are apparently not involved. For instance, no E to K mutation at position 627 of PB2 is observed, which has been considered an important factor for avian virus to ef ﬁ ciently replicate in mammalian sys- tems ( 8–11 ). Previous studies have indicated that PB1-F2 contributes viral pathogenesis in the mammalian system (13,14). No PB1-F2, however, is predicted in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses because it terminates prematurely at position 12. Its NS1 protein is truncated at position 220 and, Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1901 Table 3.

RESEARCH therefore, lacks a PDZ ligand interacting domain. As sug- gested recently, the presence of this PDZ ligand domain in-creases the pathogenicity of avian in ﬂ uenza A viruses ( 15). Regardless of whether these known factors are missed, a previous study has demonstrated that the virulence of pan-demic (H1N1) 2009 virus is higher than that of seasonal inﬂ uenza A viruses ( 16). Although a virulence marker and a host range factor may not be necessarily linked tightly, recent investigations have also demonstrated that altering PB2-627 from E to K in the avian viruses increases its viru-lence in the mammalian experimental system ( 9–11 ). For example, avian in ﬂ uenza virus subtype H7N7 reportedly infects humans ( 17). A human isolate from a fatal case had its PB2-627 changed from avian-characteristic E to K. Cor-respondingly, the species-associated signatures identi ﬁ ed in this study may serve as potential molecular targets for further evaluating how they impact the virulence of pan-demic (H1N1) 2009 viruses in humans. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the number of signature positions decreases signi ﬁ cantly from 47 (human vs. avian) to 8 (human vs. swine), and the positions of the latter are a subset of those of the former. These observations may have the following implications. First, the 3 host species of interest differ, with each providing a unique environment for infection by the in ﬂ uenza virus. When the avian virus enters humans or swine, its genetic feature is shaped by a particular evolutionary path. The viruses, therefore, have different signatures. Second, some avian-like signatures are preserved in swine viruses, suggesting that both avian species and swine may provide similar conditions for har-boring in ﬂ uenza A viruses. The body temperature may be a determinant. As is generally known, many avian species have a body temperature exceeding 40 oC; for most pigs it is variable but still higher than the human body temperature, which is 37 oC. Consequently, the signatures are retained when an avian virus enters the swine population, with simi-lar signature-related viral replication mechanisms in both species. Third, the 39 signature positions shown in Table 1, but absent from Table 2, may be correlated with certain functional domains that interact with host factors unique in humans while differing signi ﬁ cantly from those of avian and swine. Finally, the number of signature positions of swine versus humans is substantially lower than those of avian versus humans, suggesting that the species barrier to humans is easier for a swine virus to cross than for an avian virus. The entropy-based computation depends strongly on a good multiple sequence alignment. The 2 surface proteins HA and NA are excluded from this analysis because both contain sequences that diverged suf ﬁ ciently from so many subtypes of a given species. Locating conserved residues at particular positions on the basis of these alignments is ex-tremely dif ﬁ cult. The entropy threshold is the other param-eter requiring attention to locate a signature position. In this study, the entropy determined from PB2-627 of the aligned residues of all avian viruses is used because PB2-627 is the most laboratory-proved host-restriction marker ( 8–11 ). A complete new set of signatures can be reproduced rapidly by using a different entropy threshold based on other fac-tors. The diverse genetic origins of in ﬂ uenza viruses would also have great impact on the reported signatures. The proposed entropy-based method to reach the 8 positions listed in Table 2 was based on all swine viruses of differ-ent origins, including North American-(classic 1918) ori-gin strains, Eurasian (post-1979 avian)-origin strains, and recent triple reassortants. A comparison of, for example, all human viruses versus classic 1918-origin swine viruses before 1978 ( ≈75 strains, or 20% of our swine sequence population) would report 60 signature positions (data not shown). In this work, we included all swine viruses of mul-tiple origins in producing Table 2 to consider only host-spe-ciﬁ c genomic signatures that have been shaped by the same swine species regardless of origin. For the same reason, we did not subdivide avian or human populations into lineages when reporting avian-human signatures in Table 1. This study analyzed a complete collection of species- speciﬁ c inﬂ uenza A viral sequences, including the long- evolving avian, recent ancestral swine and human viruses, as well as pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses, which is still in its infancy. The amino acid sequence transition of pan-demic (H1N1) 2009 virus at the signature positions was also elucidated by applying the entropy-based signature analysis to these sequences. They were found mostly to be characteristic of avian species, as presented in Table 1. Notably, 8 of them changed from avian-like signatures to human-like signatures. Close examination of the residue transition at these 8 positions in Table 3 showed that PA-356, unlike the other 7 positions, retained an avian-like sig-nature in the recent ancestral swine population and changed to a human-like signature only in pandemic (H1N1) 2009. This ﬁ nding suggests that PA-356 may be related to host- restriction factors from swine to human species. Similarly, all ribonucleoprotein positions were scanned for the same transitioning pattern as in PA-356, i.e., a retained avian-like residue in the recent ancestral swine population and a change to the human residue in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses. Table 4 lists them all. Although 1 of the positions, PB1- 216, was not dominated by the residue S as we would have expected, it exhibited a mixture of 2 residues involv-ing a transition from avian to human viruses. In summary, Table 4 provides a list of candidate host-restriction factors that we believe are important to adaptive mutation of in ﬂ u- enza A viruses among the 3 host species. Continuous moni-toring of these signatures in nonhuman species will help in inﬂ uenza surveillance and in evaluating the likelihood of further adaptation to humans. 1902 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009

A total of 705 rodents from 6 provinces and autono- mous regions of mainland People’s Republic of China were tested by PCRs for tick-borne agents ( Anaplasma phago- cytophilum , Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, spotted fever group rickettsiae, and Francisella tularensis ). Infection rates were 5.5%, 6.7%, 9.1% and 5.0%, respectively. Eigh-teen (2.6%) rodents of 10 species were positive for 2 or 3 agents. Sequence analysis of PCR products con ﬁ rmed the presence and genotypes of detected agents. These ﬁ nd- ings demonstrate that these tick-borne agents cocirculate and that a variety of rodent species may be involved in their enzootic maintenance. Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae, and Francisella tularensis are the causative agents of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, spotted fever, and tularemia, respectively. These agents are naturally maintained in animal reservoirs and considered emerging or reemerging pathogens with serious public health impli-cations. Although these agents could infect humans through various routes, ticks play a major role in transmission from animal hosts to humans. Co-infection with these agents has been found in many tick species including Ixodes scapularis in northeastern United States, I. paciﬁ cus and I. spinipalpis in the west- ern United States I. ricinus in Europe, and I. persulcatus in Asia ( 1). Patients co-infected with 2 tick-borne pathogens usually show more severe clinical signs of longer duration (1). Experimental concurrent infections with A. phagocy- tophilum and B. burgdorferi may suppress interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon- γ production, promote IL-4 response, increase pathogen load, and intensify Lyme arthritis ( 2–4). Natural infection and co-infection with these 4 agents have been reported in the People’s Republic of China in vari-ous tick species ( 5–7) such as I. persulcatus , Dermacentor silvarum , Haemaphysalis concinna , H. longicornis , and H. warburconi , which are known to feed on small mammals as well as humans. We hypothesize that multiple agents might be pres- ent in rodents from tick-infested areas. The purpose of this study was to identify A. phagocytophilum , B. burgdorferi , SFG rickettsiae, and F. tularensis in rodents from main- land China and to better understand the public health role of these emerging and reemerging pathogens. Materials and Methods Sample Collection During 2004–2006, rodents were collected at 6 study sites in Heilongjiang Province, Inner Mongolia Autono-mous Region, Jilin Province, Zhejiang Province, Guizhou Province, and Xinjiang Autonomous Region (Figure) at various times according to peak seasons of tick spe-cies. The ﬁ rst 3 sites were forested highlands in the Small Xing’an Mountains and the Great Xing’an Mountains of northeastern China, where local residents worked and were exposed to rodents and ticks. The study sites in Zhejiang and Guizhou provinces were forested rolling hills with typical temperate zone vegetation; these regions attract hundreds of thousands of tourists per year.

Tick-borne Agents in Rodents, China in Xinjiang Autonomous Region was a forest with a rural resident population. Rodents were trapped by using pea-nuts as bait. After captured rodent species were identi ﬁ ed, spleen specimens were collected and stored at –20°C until DNA was extracted. Extraction of DNA Total DNA was extracted from spleen samples by us- ing Trizol agent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) follow-ing the instructions of the manufacturer. Brie ﬂ y, ≈300 mg of spleen tissue from each rodent was crushed in Trizol reagent, and DNA was separated from RNA by centrifuga-tion. DNA was precipitated after washing twice in a solu-tion containing 0.1 M sodium citrate in 10% ethanol. The DNA pellet was then washed in 75% ethanol and kept at room temperature for 10–20 min. After centrifugation at 2,000 × g at 2–8°C for 5 min, DNA was dissolved in 8 mmol/L NaOH and centrifuged to remove insoluble ma-terial. The supernatant containing DNA was removed and adjusted with HEPES buffer to a pH of 7–8. PCR Nested PCR was conducted with primers designed to amplify part of the 16S rRNA gene of A. phagocytophi- lum, as described ( 8). For ampli ﬁ cation of B. burgdorferi DNA, a nested PCR was performed with primers derived from B. burgdorferi 5S–23S rRNA intergenic spacer ( 9). PCR was performed by using primers Rr 190.70p and Rr 190–701n to amplify a fragment of the gene encoding a 190-kDa outer membrane protein A ( ompA ) gene speci ﬁ c for SFG rickettsiae ( 10). Samples were tested for F. tula- rensis by a nested PCR speci ﬁ c for the outer membrane protein ( fopA ) gene, as described ( 11). All PCRs were performed by using a model 2700 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). PCR products were separat-ed by agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and examined under UV light. To avoid con-tamination, we performed DNA extraction, reagent setup, ampli ﬁ cation, and agarose gel electrophoresis in separate rooms and included negative controls (distilled water) were in each ampli ﬁ cation. DNA Sequencing and Analysis PCR products of positive samples were sequenced directly by using a dideoxynucleotide cycle sequencing method with an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 377; Perkin-Elmer). To limit errors in sequencing, we per-formed 2 sequencing reactions of each PCR product. When different sequences were obtained, additional sequencing reactions were conducted to generate a consensus sequence. Sequences obtained in the present study were compared with the corresponding sequences deposited in GenBank by using the BLAST program of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Blast.cgi). Statistical Analysis Chi-square or Fisher exact tests were used to compare proportions. p values <0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁ cant. Results A total of 705 rodents were captured. The number of rodents tested and infectivity rates at different survey sites are shown in the Table. A. phagocytophilum was de- tected only in rodents captured in eastern regions of China (Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Zhejiang provinces) (Figure). B. burgdorferi was detected in rodents captured at all 6 survey sites. SFG rickettsiae were detected in rodents captured at all sites except Jilin Province. F. tularensis was detected in rodents captured only in northern China (Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces and Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang autono-mous regions; Figure). In Heilongjiang Province, all 4 agents were detected in rodents at similar frequencies ( χ 2 2.80, df 3, p = 0.424). No SFG rickettsiae were detected in rodents from Jilin Prov-ince. The infectivity rates for the 3 agents in Jilin Province did not signi ﬁ cantly differ ( χ 2 2.23, df 2, p = 0.328). In- fectivity rates for SFG rickettsiae were signi ﬁ cantly higher than those for B. burgdorferi and F. tularensis in rodents from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region ( χ2 39.76, df 2, p<0.001). Infectivity rates for the 3 agents in Xinjiang Au-tonomous Region did not differ signi ﬁ cantly (χ 2 5.01, df 2, p = 0.082). Except for F. tularensis , the other 3 agents showed similar infectivity rates for Zhejiang Province ( χ2 30, df 2, p = 0.523). Only B. burgdorferi and SFG rick- ettsiae were found in Guizhou Province, and the difference Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1905 Figure.

RESEARCH in their infectivity rates was not signi ﬁ cant (p = 0.525, by Fisher exact test). A total of 18 (2.6%, 95% con ﬁ dence interval 1.4%– 8%) rodents from all survey sites except Xinjiang Au-tonomous Region were positive for 2 or 3 agents, among which 15 were positive for 2 agents. A Clethrionomys rufo- canus rodent from Heilongjiang Province was positive for A. phagocytophilum , B. burgdorferi , and SFG rickettsiae, and 2 rodents ( Apodemus agrarius and Tamias sibiricu ) from Jilin Province were positive for A. phagocytophilum , B. burgdorferi , and F. tularensis (online Appendix Table 1, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1904-appT1.htm). Overall, except for 6 unclassi ﬁ ed rodents, 23 species of rodents captured at the 6 survey sites were identi ﬁ ed. Rodent species composition varied greatly at different sites (online Appendix Table 2, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1904-appT2.htm). Rattus norvegi- cus rodents were found at all survey sites except Xinjiang Autonomous Region. A. agrarius , A. peninsulae , Clethri- onomys rufocanus , Mus musculus , and T. sibiricu rodents were found in northeastern China; A. sylvaticus , Niviventer confucianus , and R. losea were found mainly in southern China; and Meriones unguieulataus and M. musculus were found mainly in western China. The dominant rodent species differed at various study sites. C. rufocanus (57.8%) was dominant in Heilongjiang Province, A. agrarius (36.2%) and A. peninsulae (27.1%) in Jilin Province, A. agrarius (29.7%) and Microtus maxi- mowiczii (23.7%) in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, M. musculus (50.0%) and M. unguieulataus (34.1%) in Xinjiang Autonomous Region, N. confucianus (53,0%) in Zhejiang Province, and R. norvegicus (32.14%) and M. musculus (28.6%) in Guizhou Province (online Appendix Table 2). To con ﬁ rm the presence and determine genotypes of detected organisms, PCR products were sequenced and analyzed. A 919-bp partial 16S rRNA gene fragment for A. phagocytophilum was obtained from each positive speci- men ( 8). A. phagocytophilum sequences detected in rodents from Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces (GenBank accession no. DQ342324) were identical and differed from those from Zhejiang Province (GenBank accession no. DQ458808) by 2 bp, from those from ticks in United Kingdom and Swe-den (GenBank accession nos. AY082656 and AJ242784.1, respectively) by 2 bp, and from other known A. phagocyto- philum sequences by >3 bp. Sequence analysis of the B. burgdorferi 5S–23S rRNA intergenic spacer showed that agents isolated from rodents in Heilongjiang Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Jilin Province, and Xinjiang Autonomous Region belonged to the B. garinii genospecies, similar to agents detected in ticks (GenBank accession no. DQ150540) in northern China. Of 16 B. burgdorferi detected in Zhejiang Province, 12 belonged to the B. garinii genospecies and the other 4 belonged to the B. valaisiana –related group (GenBank accession nos. EU160458 and EU160459). The 2 strains found in Guizhou Province also belonged to the B. valaisiana –related group (GenBank accession no. EU247840). For identi ﬁ cation of SFG rickettsiae, partial nucleotide sequences of the ompA gene were obtained from positive specimens in Heilongjiang Province and Inner Mongo-lia Autonomous Region. All sequences were identical to those of the R. sibirica genotype (GenBank accession no. U43807). Nucleotide sequences of 35 specimens positive for F. tularensis were identical to each other and to pub- lished sequences for the F. tularensis subsp. holarctica strain (GenBank accession no. AF247642.2). Discussion We detected A. phagocytophilum , B. burgdorferi , SFG rickettsiae, and F. tularensis in diverse species of rodents from different areas of China. Our ﬁ ndings and previous evidence ( 6,9,12–15 ) suggest that several tick-borne agents cocirculate in mainland China, and a variety of rodent spe-cies may be involved in enzootic maintenance of these agents. This study was not intended to be a comprehensive survey on active infections with A. phagocytophilum , B. burgdorferi , SFG rickettsiae, and F. tularensis . Rather, it was designed to investigate the presence and extent of these 1906 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Table.

Tick-borne Agents in Rodents, China agents in China. If one considers that human infections with A. phagocytophilum , B. burgdorferi , SFG rickettsiae, and F. tularensis have been reported in various regions of China ( 16–19 ), the presence of these agents in rodents in the study areas suggests a potential threat to humans, and the public health role of these ﬁ ndings should be further investigated. Although infectivity rates varied at different survey sites (Table, online Appendix Table 1), we could not de-termine the geographic diversity of these agents in rodents. The number of rodents examined was limited; therefore, infectivity rates in the current study could be biased. In addition, because intensity of circulation of any vector-borne agent ﬂ uctuates dramatically throughout the year and from year to year, even at the same location ( 20,21 ), we could not justify comparing infectivity rates between different sites on the basis of unsynchronized single col-lections over a 3-year period. A randomized sampling scheme and further collection of rodents are required to clarify this issue. Unfortunately, we did not collect the ticks from captured rodents for additional testing of the tick-transmitted agents. This limitation prevented us from understanding vector potential. In this study, A. phagocytophilum was detected only in eastern China (Table, Figure), where it coexists with the other 3 agents (online Appendix Table 1). A. phagocyto- philum detected in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Zhejiang prov- inces were closely related to each other by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, but less related to other known strains in other countries. B. burgdorferi was detected in rodents from all 6 survey sites. As observed in a previous study (9), B. garinii was the dominant genospecies in mainland China, and the B. valaisiana –related group was present in southern China. SFG rickettsiae, including ≈20 species of rickettsiae, can be transmitted to animals and humans not only by ticks but also by other arthropods such as infected lice, ﬂ eas, and mites ( 10). In this study, we ampli ﬁ ed the ompA gene, which is present in most SFG rickettsiae ( 10,22 ). The overall in- fectivity rate for SFG rickettsiae was highest (9.1%) among the 4 agents tested (online Appendix Table 1). Sequence analysis identi ﬁ ed the Rickettsia sp. detected in Heilongji- ang Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as a genotype of R. sibirica , which is known to cause Siberian tick typhus ( 18). However, we did not sequence PCR prod- ucts ampli ﬁ ed from rodents at other study sites because of a limited amount of samples. Although sequence analysis of the ompA gene fragment is not suf ﬁ cient to identify the agent ( 22), it is commonly used to recognize tick-borne Rickettsia spp. in ﬁ eld surveys ( 23). F. tularensis was found only in northern China, which veriﬁ es our belief that F. tularensis is present only north of 30°N latitude. In many disease-endemic areas, ticks are known to play a role in transmitting F. tularensis from animal hosts to humans, although other arthropods such as deer ﬂ ies, ﬂ eas, mites, and mosquitoes are known to carry the bacterium. Sequence analysis showed that all F. tularensis detected in this study belong to the subspecies holarctica . Interference of infections among A. phagocytophilum , B. burgdorferi , SFG rickettsiae, and F. tularensis in rodent hosts is not clear. Our ﬁ ndings indicate that infection with A. phagocytophilum does not intensify risk for transmis- sion of the other 3 agents and vice versa. B. burgdorferi in rodents appears to increase risk for infection with F. tu- larensis but does not increase the possibility of infection with SFG rickettsiae or A. phagocytophilum . Further in- vestigations are needed to demonstrate positive or negative interactions of the pathogens and to establish whether this interference is associated with the animal species. Of 705 rodents tested in this study, 15 were infected with 2 agents and 3 were infected with 3 agents. These ﬁ ndings indicate that mixed natural foci of tick-borne agents are present at the study sites. Because A. phago- cytophilum , B. burgdorferi , SFG rickettsiae, and F. tu- larensis were found in ticks collected in the study areas (6–9,12–14 ), it is not surprising that multiple agents were detected in rodents. Coexistence of multiple agents might be caused by a single bite of a tick infected with several agents or multiple bites of ticks infected with at least 1 agent. The presence of 4 pathogens in the study areas demonstrates the risk for multiple infections in humans, which may lead to variations and exacerbation of clini-cal signs ( 1). Therefore, differential diagnoses should be made for febrile patients with a history of tick bites in these areas, particularly when clinical signs are atypical for 1 disease or a related disease. Among 23 rodent species trapped in this study, 21 were infected with >1 agent (online Appendix Table 2). Only 2 species ( Cricetulus migratourius and N. fulvescens ) were negative for all 4 agents. Which species is the main host of each agent remains unknown, because none of the agents are predominantly associated with 1 or a few related rodent species, regardless of their geographic origin. How-ever, A. phagocytophilum , B. burgdorferi , SFG rickettsiae, and F. tularensis in various rodent species illustrate the potential roles of various rodents in maintaining these tick- borne agents. Systematic epidemiologic studies that inves-tigate characteristics of natural foci and the role of small wild animals in transmission of these agents to humans are needed.

The outbreak of in ﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 prompted many countries in Asia, previously strongly af-fected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), to respond with stringent measures, particularly in preventing outbreaks in hospitals. We studied actual direct costs and cost-effectiveness of different response measures from a hospital perspective in tertiary hospitals in Singapore by simulating outbreaks of SARS, pandemic (H1N1) 2009, and 1918 Spanish in ﬂ uenza. Protection measures target- ing only infected patients yielded lowest incremental cost/death averted of $23,000 (US$) for pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Enforced protection in high-risk areas (Yellow Alert) and full protection throughout the hospital (Orange Alert) averted deaths but came at an incremental cost of up to $2.5 million/death averted. SARS and Spanish in ﬂ uenza favored more stringent measures. High case-fatality rates, virulence, and high proportion of atypical manifestations impacted cost-ef-fectiveness the most. A calibrated approach in accordance with viral characteristics and community risks may help re-ﬁ ne responses to future epidemics. Pandemic in ﬂ uenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus is a new in- ﬂ uenza virus of swine origin that was ﬁ rst detected in April 2009. Within 4 months of its appearance in Mexico, it had spread to >100 countries, with >200,000 con ﬁ rmed cases globally, including >2,000 deaths ( 1). When the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its global in ﬂ u- enza pandemic alert to phase 5 (imminent pandemic) on April 27, 2009, many countries followed suit and activated their pandemic preparedness plans, although this varied be-tween countries. Many countries with direct experience of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) out-break tended toward more stringent measures. Singapore was one of the countries most affected by SARS and experienced a disproportionate impact of the spread of the disease in hospitals ( 2,3). A total of 98 health- care workers in Singapore were infected with SARS, 6 of whom died ( 4). After the SARS experience, Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) developed a pandemic in ﬂ uenza plan with several levels of response that correlated roughly with the WHO Pandemic Alert Response system ( 5). The Disease Outbreak Response System (DORSCON)-FLU system that MOH devised requires progressively higher levels of infection control in hospitals in addition to bor-der screening, restrictions on visitors to hospitals, and community-based syndromic surveillance for acute febrile illnesses (Table 1). In accordance with the progressive elevation of WHO pandemic alert levels, Singapore raised its own pandemic alert level to Yellow on April 27, 2009, and further elevat-ed it to Orange 2 days later. At this level, all hospital staff were required to wear N95 masks when dealing with all pa-tients. Patients were restricted to 1 registered and screened visitor, all medical and nursing student rotations and lo-cal medical conferences were cancelled, leave restrictions for healthcare workers (HCWs) were put in place, inter-hospital movement of patients and HCWs was banned, and Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Hospital Infection Control Response to an Epidemic Respiratory Virus Threat Yock Young Dan, Paul A.

RESEARCH further limitations were placed on elective surgery. These measures were aimed primarily at avoiding a repeat of the SARS epidemic where nosocomial transmission originated with patients whose SARS infections were undiagnosed in hospital, and because in ﬂ uenza may be contagious before symptoms develop in infected patients. In fact, nosocomial inﬂ uenza has been well documented since the 1957 Asian inﬂ uenza pandemic ( 6). Based on studies conducted pri- marily in the United States, it has been estimated that 1 nosocomial case of in ﬂ uenza in a pediatric unit can cost up to $7,500 (US) ( 7). A recent review ( 8) of 28 nosocomial outbreaks of seasonal in ﬂ uenza summarized the evidence for nosocomial transmission of in ﬂ uenza in hospitals with accompanying illness and death ( 8,9). When it subsequently became apparent that the case- fatality rate for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was much lower than previously thought, especially in settings of industrial-ized countries, the alert level in Singapore was lowered to Yellow on May 11, 2009, even as WHO moved to alert level 6 after the pandemic was declared. The risks and impacts of an outbreak will no doubt de- pend on the transmissibility, virulence, and clinical severity of illness. Thus, the bene ﬁ ts of a high alert status response at the onset of an outbreak as a “safe rather than sorry” strategy is not unreasonable when faced with an unknown novel potentially lethal virus. Yet, on the other hand, pre-ventive measures from a hospital perspective come with a price. Direct costs include activation as well as ongoing ad-ministrative, manpower, and logistic resources, such as use of enhanced personal protective equipment, as part of the alert response measures.We made use of this unique opportunity to evaluate the real costs of our primary prevention interventions and their potential cost-effectiveness against different models of inﬂ uenza virulence and transmissibility in a simulated outbreak in our 1,000-bed tertiary teaching hospital to un-derstand the relative incremental cost per additional death averted at different alert status levels. The key variables that affected the cost-effectiveness ratio the most were identi ﬁ ed and studied. The same analysis was subsequently repeated for a parallel 1,500-bed tertiary teaching hospi-tal. Using the outcome variables of disease cases, deaths, and incremental cost per death averted, we sought to deter-mine if a calibrated and measured response plan based on characteristics of the virus in the outbreak could be better deﬁ ned. Methods To determine the cost incurred per day over the period where hospitals were at DORSCON Yellow and Orange, we obtained actual direct and indirect costs from the Op-erations and Finance Departments of the hospitals. Excess costs were measured by comparing these with operating costs and results over the same period in 2008. To simulate a hospital outbreak, we used a decision analysis model to perform cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the impact of an outbreak from a single index case that was not detected by hospital surveillance and was found in the general ward. The Markov decision model was built using Treeage software (www.treeage.com), and sim-ulation was performed based on hospital staff and inpatients (n = 7,500) over a time horizon of 30 days.

Infection Control Response to Epidemic Respiratory Virus would transit between exclusive Markov states of Suscep- tible, Exposed, Incubation, Infectious, Isolated, Atypical, Recovered, or Dead. (Figure 1). The scenario assumes that all clinical cases will be identi ﬁ ed and isolated. Infection is thus transmitted in the preclinical infectious phase or by atypical or subclinical cases not recognized and hence not isolated, as well as through the failure of personal protec-tive equipment. Variables studied in the model included the number of persons exposed per infected patient, secondary attack rate, percentage of atypical and subclinical cases, duration of preclinical infectious period, and infectious pe-riod, as well as case-fatality rate. Based on preliminary data available at the time of writ- ing, comparisons were made between 3 respiratory viruses: a SARS-like virus, a 1918 Spanish in ﬂ uenza–like virus, and a pandemic (H1N1) 2009–type virus. Validation of the model was performed by comparing generated reproduc-tion numbers to reported estimates from actual SARS data in Singapore ( 10) and Spanish in ﬂ uenza (for con ﬁ ned ar- eas) ( 11) and showed consistent case and death numbers. We compared 4 different strategies: 1) no additional mea-sures; 2) Green Alert response, which mandated personal protective equipment (PPE) for HCWs in direct contact with patients suspected of having avian in ﬂ uenza or other emerging infectious diseases; 3) Yellow Alert response, which mandated enhanced PPE at all high-risk areas; and 4) Orange Alert response, which mandated N95 masks for all patient contact and the restrictions described above (Table 1). Outcome measures were number of patients in-fected, number of deaths, cost (in US$) per case prevented, and cost per death prevented compared to baseline where no preventive measures were implemented, as well as in-cremental cost per death averted compared with the corre-sponding lower level of alert status. Multivariate sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the impact of viral characteristics as well as different hospital response poli-cies on cost-effectiveness outcomes. The number of persons exposed in hospital and protective gear failure rates were from an actual outbreak simulation exercise performed at our hospital ( 12). Because there were no cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infections during this period, estimates were all based on those in the literature ( 13). Details of the input variables are included in Table 2. Results An outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 from intro- duction by an HCW, a patient with undiagnosed infection, or a visitor in our hospital at base case with no protection measures will result in 2,580 infected patients at 30 days. This ﬁ nding would be similar to that of seasonal in ﬂ uenza and correspond to a 30% attack rate. With a 0.4% mortality rate, there would be 10 deaths from infection with pandem-ic (H1N1) 2009 virus. In contrast, Spanish in ﬂ uenza would result in 3,210 infected patients and 161 deaths (case-fa- tality rate 5%). The increased number of infections in the Spanish in ﬂ uenza model is driven by the short incubation time of the epidemic and results in more rounds of infection rather than an increase in basic reproductive number (aver-age number of secondary cases per index case) ( 14). On the other hand, because SARS has a longer incubation period and lower transmissibility rate, the number of infected pa-tients is lower at 825 but, owing to the high case-fatality rates, 82 deaths may ensue (Table 3). Green Alert status mandates PPE for HCWs in direct contact with patients suspected of having the infection. Transmission will thus be only through preclinical cases before they are identi ﬁ ed and patients can be isolated or through atypical or subclinical cases that are missed. We assumed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has a lowered 50% trans-missibility for atypical or subclinical cases ( 15); this rate effectively reduced the infected patients to 316 with only 1 death (Figure 2, panel B). This resulted in additional costs of $95 to prevent 1 additional infected patient and $23,600 to prevent 1 death. Moving to Yellow Alert would reduce infected patients to 59 and avert all deaths. The costs to prevent additional infection and death are $3,221 and $828,000, respectively. Activating Orange alert with full PPE gear, restricting visitors, and cancelling elective procedures would halve the infections to only 24 cases with no deaths. However, the additional cost over Yellow Alert would escalate to $7,153 per infection prevented and a staggering $2.5 million to in ﬁ nity for 1 death averted (Figure 3). Simulation for Spanish in ﬂ uenza showed a decreased number of deaths from 31 at Green Alert to 6 at Yellow Alert and 3 at Orange Alert (Figure 2, panel B). This ﬁ nd- ing translated to $50,000 per death averted moving from Green to Yellow and $153,000 per death averted moving from Yellow Alert to Orange. For SARS, on the other hand, the incremental cost of moving from Green Alert to Yellow Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1911 Figure 1. Markov model simulating a stochastic simulation of epidemics approach for an outbreak in a hospital institution.

RESEARCH is $120,000 per death averted; this drops to $75,000 when moving from Yellow to Orange. This ﬁ nding is mainly due to the high (10%) case-fatality rate and the relatively higher percentage of atypical patients who are missed and not iso-lated, a lesson learned from the actual SARS experience (Figure 3). Sensitivity analysis showed that the factors that im- pacted the cost-effectiveness ratio most are case-fatality rate, patient exposure rate, and secondary attack rate (Figure 4). In the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 scenario, the case fatality-rate ranging from 0.1% (seasonal in ﬂ uenza) to 10% (SARS) results in the cost per death averted moving from inﬁ nity (no death) to $35,000 per death averted (Orange Alert). Similarly, changing the exposure rate from 1.5 per-sons/day (10% PPE failure rate, Orange Alert) to 30 per-sons/day (0% reduction) per infected patient changed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from $2.5 million per death averted to $23,000. If pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had a higher 50% transmission rate, Orange Alert would become the most cost-effective strategy. The other variables had an impact on cost per case prevented but did not impact the incremental cost per death averted ratio. To determine the impact of hospital size on our model, we modeled our simulation on the nation’s other tertiary hospital with 1,500 beds using their actual cost records. The model estimates that 10 expected deaths in the outbreak would be reduced to 1 death under Green Alert and none in Yellow and Orange Alerts. The incremental cost/death averted is $32,000, $1.9 million, and $5.4 million when moving from Green to Yellow to Orange, respectively. Al-though the cost ranking is consistent with that predicted by base-case simulation, the actual incremental cost index is much higher, re ﬂ ecting the higher cost for activating alert status in a bigger hospital.

Infection Control Response to Epidemic Respiratory Virus pandemic response plans based on a SARS model ( 5). The lessons of the SARS epidemic, in particular the effect of protecting HCWs from patients with undiagnosed, uniso-lated respiratory viral infections ( 16,17), have been applied rigorously to the pandemic plans of the Singapore Ministry of Health. Although it is dif ﬁ cult to quantify the impact of these interventions when they are taken as a whole, data from our modeling show that a nuanced approach that con-centrates on administrative measures to isolate patients and selectively use PPE when working with patients suspected of having novel strains of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus would have a relatively favorable cost-effectiveness ratio. On the other hand, the psychological and economic impact of SARS has been described as one of Singapore’s most traumatic experiences and one that left deep scars on the healthcare system of this country ( 18). It could be and has been argued that a draconian approach that seeks to pro-tect all HCWs fully ensures that every case of in ﬂ uenza is identi ﬁ ed early and contacts traced. Any healthcare facility ensuring no second- or third-generation transmission would provide intangible gains that exceed the economic costs of such a strategy. Nevertheless, this desire must still be bal-anced against the community impact of a disease such as inﬂ uenza, which has a different epidemiology than SARS (7). We currently believe that pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vi- rus causes predominantly community-based disease ( 13). Data from the United States, where infection control rec-ommendations ( 19) are similar to our DORSCON Green, have not shown any evidence to date of large nosocomial outbreaks. In our model, we have shown that cost-effectiveness ratio is dependent on the interplay between exposure rate, transmissibility (secondary attack rate), case-fatality rate, and risk of transmission from atypical cases. Infectious dis- eases with high fatality rates and transmission from atypi-cal cases (such as SARS) will need the full bene ﬁ t of PPE to reduce mortality rates. This ﬁ nding is re ﬂ ected in Orange Alert having a better cost-effectiveness ratio than Yellow Alert. Mild diseases with low fatality rates, such as pan-demic (H1N1) 2009, and low incidence of atypical or sub-clinical infectious cases have the best cost-effectiveness ra-tio at Green Alert provided surveillance measures are able to identify infected patients and isolate them early. The cost-effectiveness ratio increases exponentially after that due to the much higher costs incurred. However, although Yellow Alert comes at a heavier price tag, it effectively averts any deaths. Activating Orange Alert increases cost with minimal bene ﬁ t in mortality rate reduction. In reality, our model suggests that parallel efforts in contact tracing and voluntary quarantine may further reduce the exposure rate and break the chain of transmission. Our base model took into account only direct costs as- sociated with each alert status. In real situations, indirect costs such as lost revenues from cancellation of elective surgeries to free up hospital resources, decreased elec-tive admissions and outpatient attendances, administrative costs associated with senior staff meetings, and lost clini-cal teaching time, add up to more than the direct costs and would magnify the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio fur-ther. In fact, if direct and indirect costs were included in the modeling, the incremental cost/death averted ratio of moving from Yellow Alert to Orange in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 increased to a staggering $8–$81 million for both hospitals. Although these indirect costs are not part of the infection control process per se, surge capacity response plans to ensure that the healthcare system has the reserve Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1913 Table 3.

RESEARCH capacity to react to a full-blown community outbreak are critical to all pandemic plans ( 20) and contribute serious costs to the hospital. The major limitations of our study are that we have sim- ulated a situation in which community infection is still rela-tively low and the outbreak in hospital arises from 1 index case. When a community epidemic is established, the inci-dence of new index cases entering the institution increases, especially if there are prevalent atypical or subclinically infected persons. In such a scenario the cost-effectiveness ratio of higher alert status will decrease, and it may become more bene ﬁ cial to escalate protective measures. Cost-effectiveness analyses merely provide a math- ematical projection to better understand the key factors that affect outcomes. The actual magnitude of the cost-effec-tiveness will vary depending on institutional cost, which varies between different sized hospitals and whether direct or indirect costs are included. Nonetheless, knowledge of the exponential relationship of the different viruses on the cost-effectiveness ranking is critical in charting response policy. Indirect costs of an uncontrolled pandemic are also economic and social, especially in Singapore where the economy is dependent on trade and tourism. A higher cost-effectiveness ratio does not imply that additional lives are not worth saving. In the case of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, if it costs $2.5 million to prevent 1 death, using a median age of 37 years for persons who died ( 21) and expected life expectancy of 80 years ( 22), the incremental cost-ef- fectiveness ratio works out to $40,000 per life-year saved. In addition, preventive measures go beyond saving lives and include resultant savings from reducing hospitaliza-tion of infected patients and prolonged intensive care with mechanical ventilation for severe cases, as well as the logistic costs of further contact tracing and quarantine. We have not factored the cost of in ﬂ uenza antiviral prophylaxis or the costs and effectiveness of novel vaccina-tions that may be required, nor did we include the costs of work-days lost from staff taking medical leave due to their 1914 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 Figure 2.

Infection Control Response to Epidemic Respiratory Virus being infected or being placed in quarantine. The impact of lax border controls, subclinical patients carrying the virus into the community, and closure of community institutions or even hospitals due to an outbreak were also not com-puted. We assumed that the hospital is a closed community with a ﬁ xed number of staff and patients. This obviously is not true in real life but is mitigated in our analysis because the same assumption is applied to every response measure and the outcomes are incremental indices over another lev-el of protection. From the perspective of a healthcare institution, how do we predict the virulence of new virus early in the out-break and adopt the most cost-effective response policy? If a mild epidemic spreads rapidly through the community, there might be multiple points of entry into the hospital; however, such a mild community outbreak might present more commonly to primary healthcare clinics and presenta-tions to hospital may be few. Thus a step-up approach from Green to Yellow in accordance with predicted risks as we have shown may be the most cost-effective approach. It is not known for certain how pandemic (H1N1) 2009 will behave in subsequent waves. Although the new virus seems to have relatively low virulence, the virus might re-emerge with a case-fatality rate more like that of the 1918 inﬂ uenza pandemic or the SARS pandemic. Our model shows that DORSCON Green, which focuses on infection control for suspected cases, will achieve a relatively high degree of protection for our staff, patients, and visitors even in the setting of a higher case-fatality rate. The main advantage of DORSCON Yellow and Orange is that unde-tected infected persons that are not isolated are less likely to become a source of transmission if there is universal use of N95 masks. This has to be balanced with the degree of compliance that can be achieved by the use of full-scale PPE for patients with no risk of the disease (e.g., patients with trauma or other medical or surgical conditions) and the well known adverse effects of prolonged use of N95 masks ( 23). However, it is useful to also note that although a step- up approach may be the most cost-effective for the health-care institution, the appropriate policy stance at the national level may not necessarily be the same. Our model did not take into account the psychological and economic impact to the country and the larger healthcare system, which are serious factors to consider when making a policy decision on the appropriate response across the healthcare system. Singapore, Hong Kong, and China were among the settings most severely affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003. In the initial face of an unknown virus with a perceived high mortality rate in Mexico, Singapore’s response to ﬁ rst err on the side of safety and make adjustments dynamically as the situation became clearer therefore would be reasonable when viewed from the larger perspective. Such actions, however, were not without their own ad- verse effects in terms of cost and in overall patient care at the healthcare institution. We had the opportunity to per-form a cost-effectiveness analysis using the actual costs incurred from this heightened infection control response. We have quanti ﬁ ed how the virulence or case-fatality rate of a respiratory viral infection has a serious impact on the hospital infection control response. This impact occurs at 2 levels, ﬁ rst, the actual number of deaths and ill persons, and second, the direct and indirect costs on the hospital in terms of activation, logistics, and lost revenue. This impact is re-ﬂ ected in the subsequent responses of Singapore and other countries when the virulence of the novel in ﬂ uenza virus appeared to be much less than previously feared. Under-standing the key factors that affect the cost-effectiveness ratio will enable us to make better informed decisions as we prepare to respond to future epidemics.

Highland areas where malaria transmission is unstable are targets for malaria elimination because transmission decreases to low levels during the dry season. In highland areas of Kipsamoite and Kapsisiywa, Kenya (population ≈7,400 persons), annual household indoor residual spray- ing with a synthetic pyrethroid was performed starting in 2005, and artemether/lumefantrine was implemented as ﬁ rst-line malaria treatment in October 2006. During April 2007–March 2008, no microscopy-con ﬁ rmed cases of ma- laria occurred at the sites. In 4 assessments of asymptom-atic persons during May 2007–April 2008, a total of <0.3% of persons were positive for asexual Plasmodium falciparum by microscopy or PCR at any time, and none were positive by PCR at the last 2 sample collections. Our ﬁ ndings show that in such areas, interruption and eventual elimination of malaria transmission may be achievable with widespread annual indoor residual spraying of households and artemisi-nin combination therapy. Widespread implementation of malaria control inter- ventions such as insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) have resulted in dramatic reductions of transmission in areas where this disease is endemic ( 1–3). For the ﬁ rst time since the 1950s, the World Health Organization and other organizations are promoting malaria eradication ( 4). In highland areas (>1,500 m above sea level) in Africa, malaria transmis-sion is unstable, with a low incidence of malaria during dry seasons ( 5). These areas may be ideal initial targets for at- tempting the interruption of malaria transmission. Also in these areas, the combination of ACT, which may decrease transmission by reducing gametocyte load in infected per-sons, and annual indoor residual spraying (IRS) with long-lasting insecticides, which can reduce indoor vector density for a prolonged period, could act synergistically to interrupt malaria transmission. We have conducted malaria epidemiology studies in the adjoining highland areas of Kipsamoite and Kapsisiywa, Nandi Hills District, Kenya, since 2003. Starting in 2005, the Ministry of Health of Kenya introduced new interven-tions to reduce malaria transmission and improve malaria treatment in these areas. Interventions introduced included IRS, distribution of ITNs to pregnant women and their chil-dren <5 years of age, and provision of artemether/lumefan-trine (co-artemether) as ﬁ rst-line therapy for uncomplicated malaria. The present study documents the changes in ma-laria transmission that occurred during the period of these interventions and provides evidence that malaria transmis-sion was interrupted during April 2007–March 2008. Methods Study Site The study was conducted in the adjacent highland areas of Kipsamoite (7 villages) and Kapsisiywa (9 villages) in the Nandi Hills District of Kenya. Study site characteristics have been described ( 6). Elevation ranges from 1,829 m to 2,132 m. In both areas, malaria transmission is unstable. A malaria epidemic occurred in Kipsamoite in 2002 ( 7). Historically, Kapsisiywa has had more malaria cases than Kipsamoite, likely because its elevation is lower, a swamp surrounds it, and it has more areas where water is likely to pool ( 6).Possible Interruption of Malaria Transmission, Highland Kenya, 2007–2008 Chandy C.

RESEARCH Study Population and Recruitment Persons living in these areas are predominantly Nandi, a Kalenjin subtribe. Demographic analysis, malaria sur-veillance, and collection of weather and vector density information were performed in these areas as part of 2 related studies, a study of malaria early warning systems and a study of malaria transmission and immunity. Writ-ten informed consent for study participation was obtained from consenting heads of households in the area for de-mographic studies and from persons (or parents/guardians of persons <15 years of age) for other studies. Ethical ap-proval for the study was obtained from the Kenya Medical Research Institute National Ethical Review Committee and the Institutional Review Boards for Human Studies at Case Western Reserve University, the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention, and the University of Minnesota. Demography and Surveillance for Clinical Malaria and Asymptomatic Persons Demographic surveys of all households were started in April 2003 and conducted every 4 to 6 months. Start-ing in 2005, these surveys included assessments of travel, ITN use, and IRS treatment of houses. Clinical malaria surveillance was conducted during 2003–2008 Kenyan Ministry of Health dispensaries, the only healthcare fa-cilities within the study area. Free malaria diagnosis and treatment were available to all persons with symptoms of malaria. Persons with symptoms of malaria (fever, chills, severe malaise, headache) who did not have a clear al-ternative diagnosis by history and physical examination were assessed for malaria by microscopic examination of blood smears. Clinical malaria was de ﬁ ned as symptoms of malaria and a positive blood smear for Plasmodium falciparum or P. malariae . Primary treatment for uncomplicated malaria was given according to Kenya Ministry of Health provisions for the clinics: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (2003–2004), amo-diaquine (2004–2006), and co-artemether (2006–2008). Because of changes in studies, forms, and clinic person-nel, clinical surveillance was not conducted in January and July–November 2006, in Kipsamoite; and July–December 2005, and January, March, and June–November 2006, in Kapsisiywa. Four surveys for parasitemia in asymptomatic persons were conducted during 2007–2008. In May 2007, samples were collected from all consenting persons who were liv-ing on site during the time of collection (5,788 persons). In August 2007, samples were collected from 605 per-sons randomly selected from the overall population for active surveillance of malaria. Testing was repeated in samples from 577 and 538 of these persons in the cohort in November 2007 and April 2008, respectively. PCR was performed on 400 randomly selected samples from each period and on any sample that was parasite positive by microscopy. Microscopy and PCR Microscopy testing for Plasmodium species was per- formed as described ( 7) by using 2 independent readings and a third reading for slides with discordant results. For PCR testing, genomic DNA was isolated with a QIAamp 96 DNA blood kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) from dried blood spots collected on Whatman 903 ﬁ lter pa- per (Whatman Corporation, Florham Park, NJ, USA). P. falciparum infection was detected by nested PCR speci ﬁ c for the small subunit RNA gene as described ( 8). In previ- ous surveys in these areas, we documented low frequencies of P. malariae infection (<1%) and no P. vivax or P. ovale infections ( 7,9) by microscopy and PCR. Thus, we did not further test for these infections. Assessment of Rainfall, Temperature, and Indoor Resting Vector Density Daily rainfall was measured with standard metal rain gauges, and daily minimum and maximum temperatures were recorded with maximum/minimum mercury ther-mometers placed in 7 villages in Kipsamoite. Values from the 7 villages were averaged. Household indoor resting density of Anopheles spp. was measured in 4 cluster areas at each site; each cluster area comprised approximately equal numbers of persons. Three index households were randomly selected for each cluster, and the index house plus its 4 nearest neighbors were sampled. Sixty households in Kipsamoite and 60 households in Kapsisiywa were sampled every 2 weeks. Pyrethrum knockdown captures were conducted by using standard methods ( 10). Anopheles spp. mosquitoes were identi ﬁ ed taxonomically, ﬁ rst in the ﬁ eld by trained ﬁ eld assistants and then by an entomologist from the Kenya Medical Research Institute. Data Analysis Annual malaria incidence, rainfall, temperature, and vector density during April 2003–March 2004, were used as baseline data and compared with data from subsequent years beginning in April 2004. Annual malaria incidence was compared by using negative binomial regression analysis, except for April 2007–March 2008, when it was compared by Fisher exact test because no cases occurred during that year. For years with missing months of inci-dence data, malaria incidence in the recorded months was compared with incidence in the same months in the refer-ence year (April 2003–March 2004). For periods when no cases were detected, a 1-sided 95% con ﬁ dence interval was constructed. Mean daily temperature and mean monthly rainfall were compared by using the 2-sample t test.

Possible Interruption of Malaria Transmission dian monthly vector density was compared by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All data analysis was conducted by using Stata version 10.0 software (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). Results IRS, ITNs, and Malaria Treatment with Co-artemether at Health Centers The population ranged from 3,250 to 4,253 in Kipsam- oite and from 3,412 to 3,841 in Kapsisiywa. The Ministry of Health ﬁ rst conducted limited indoor residual spray- ing in 2005. The number of households sprayed increased markedly in 2007 (Table 1). The primary insecticide used in both sites was lambda cyhalothrin at a dose of 10–20 mg/m ITNs were distributed per Ministry of Health policy to pregnant women and their children <5 years of age when the women came to the health centers for antenatal care. A copayment was required in most instances. Short-lasting nets treated with α-cypermethrin were provided during 2005–2006, and long-lasting nets treated with deltamethrin or permethrin have been provided since 2006. Persons were asked, “Have you slept under a treated bednet regularly since the last demography survey?” During 2006–2008, the percentage of persons who reported sleeping under an ITN decreased from 17.3% to 11.1% in Kipsamoite and from 27.9% to 15.1% in Kapsisiywa. Co-artemether became of ﬁ cial ﬁ rst-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria by Kenyan Ministry of Health pol-icy in May 2004, but it was not implemented in these sites until October 23, 2006 (Kapsisiwya) and February 6, 2007 (Kipsamoite). Co-artemether was also not widely available in local shops or neighboring clinics before these dates.Malaria and Symptoms Consistent with Malaria, 2003–2008 When compared with the April 2003–March 2004 reference year, malaria incidence in Kipsamoite increased in 2004, returned to 2003 levels in 2005, and decreased in 2006 (Table 2, Figure 1, panel A). In contrast, malaria in-cidence decreased slightly in Kapsisiywa in 2004 and then decreased in 2005 and 2006 (Table 2, Figure 1, panel B). Malaria incidence in Kapsisiywa was higher than in Kip-samoite in 2003 (p<0.001) and 2004 (p = 0.06), but not in any other year. At both sites during March 20, 2007–March 30, 2008, microscopically con ﬁ rmed cases of malaria were found among symptomatic persons (Table 2, Figure 1, pan-els A and B). Overall clinic attendance, although seasonal and vari- able, did not decrease during 2007–2008 at either site (Fig-ure 1, panels C and D). During March 20, 2007–March 30, 2008, when 0 of 416 symptomatic persons had evidence of P. falciparum parasitemia by microscopy (0%, 1-sided 95% con ﬁ dence interval 0%–0.9%), 17 (7.3%) of 231 symptomatic persons who provided blood samples for PCR testing were positive for P. falciparum .

RESEARCH for 2 samples, which were obtained in December 2007. In symptomatic persons, gametocyte prevalence, assessed by microscopy, was low in all years (2.8%, 2.9%, 0.8%, 0.8%, and 0% in Kipsamoite and 0.4%, 1%, 0%, 0%, and 0% in Kapsisiywa during 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, re-spectively). Asexual Parasitemia and Gametocytemia in Asymptomatic Persons, 2007–2008 In 4 surveys of asymptomatic persons during 2007– 2008, a total of <0.3% were positive for P. falciparum tro- phozoites or gametocytes by microscopy during any period. In the last 2 periods, no person was positive for asexual P. falciparum by PCR (Table 3). The person positive for P. falciparum trophozoites by microscopy in April 2008 was also positive for gametocytes. PCR showed that this person did not have an asexual P. falciparum infection.Changes in Rainfall, Temperature, and Vector Density, 2003–2008 During 2003–2008, no consistent pattern of increased or decreased temperature was shown, and the average daily temperature during 2007–2008, the year in which no malar-ia cases were documented by microscopy, was most similar to that in 2003, the year of highest malaria incidence (Figure 2, panel A, Table 4). Average monthly rainfall did not dif-fer between years (Figure 2, panel B, Table 4). A decrease in anopheline mosquito density was seen in 2004, before any widespread IRS treatment program, but sustained low levels of mosquito density were ﬁ rst seen after IRS treat- ments (Figure 2, panel C; Table 5). Of 447 anopheline mos-quitoes caught over this 5-year period, 439 (98.21%) were identi ﬁ ed as An. gambiae , 6 (1.34%) were identi ﬁ ed as An. funestus , and 2 (0.45%) were not identi ﬁ ed. 1920 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 Figure 1.

Possible Interruption of Malaria Transmission Discussion Implementation of highly effective methods of de- creasing malaria transmission, including ITNs, IRS, and ACT, has led to renewed discussion about global eradi-cation of malaria ( 4,11). A major goal in moving toward eradicating malaria is interruption or elimination of local malaria transmission. The World Health Organization has stated that “elimination has been achieved when the ‘pre-vention of reintroduction’, without local transmission by mosquitoes, has been successful for three or more consecu-tive years” ( 12). Interruption of local transmission is the step before elimination, in which it is documented that local transmission of malaria is absent in a previously malaria-endemic area for a speci ﬁ c period. The present study pro- vides microscopy evidence of interruption of local malaria transmission in 2 adjacent highland areas of unstable trans-mission. Malaria could recur in these areas, and it is unclear precisely how much speci ﬁ c factors (e.g., IRS, ACT, and changes in rainfall and temperature) affected malaria trans-mission and incidence. Overall, however, data support the idea that in unstable transmission settings, combining regu-lar, widespread IRS campaigns and use of ACT as ﬁ rst-line antimalarial treatment has the potential to interrupt local malaria transmission. IRS probably played a major role in reducing malaria transmission in these areas for several reasons. First, sus-tained decreases in indoor resting Anopheles spp. mosquito density were seen after the IRS campaigns. Second, in both sites, malaria incidence decreased only after IRS was widely applied. In Kipsamoite, no large reduction in ma-laria incidence was seen until 2007, when spraying covered >70% of households. In Kapsisiywa, ≈50% of households were sprayed in 2005 and 2006, and a large decrease in ma-laria incidence was observed in both years. In 2007, after >90% of households were sprayed, malaria transmission was interrupted for the subsequent year. Third, in contrast to IRS, 2 factors that could affect vector density and there-fore malaria incidence, rainfall and temperature, showed no clear relationship with either vector density or malaria incidence. A reduction in vector density was seen in both sites in 2003 before the IRS campaigns. Potential reasons for this reduction include an unusual decrease in temperature dur-ing July–September 2003 (Figure 2). This decrease in tem-perature coincided with the ﬁ rst decrease in vector density; another possible reason for the decrease was pyrethrum spray catch testing of anopheline vectors conducted by our team, which started in April 2003. Although spraying with short-term insecticide does not usually affect vector density in areas of high transmission, spraying of approximately one sixth of all households every 2 weeks may have had an effect on the adult vector population, which led to a smaller breeding pool and lower overall vector density in this area of low transmission. The decrease in malaria incidence in Kipsamoite in 2005, after only 15% of households were sprayed, may in part re ﬂ ect the effects of greater spraying in neighboring Kapsisiywa. The decrease may also re ﬂ ect the combined effect of partial coverage with ITNs and ad-ditional coverage by IRS. Reduction of incidence in Kip-samoite in 2005 was not caused by concentrated spraying in areas of malaria clustering ( 5) because spraying was near- ly absent in these areas. Reductions in malaria incidence were seen in Kapsisiywa in 2005–2006 after spraying of 40%–50% of households, but the small peak in incidence seen subsequently in these 2 years, but not 2007 (Figure 1), suggests that for interruption, a higher percentage of house-holds (>70%) must be sprayed. Treatment of malaria patients with co-artemether re- duces gametocyte carriage and density in children and makes them less infectious to mosquitoes than treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus chloroquine ( 13). The effect of co-artemether on gametocytes may have been synergistic with the effect of widespread IRS on the Anopheles spp. vector in reducing malaria transmission.

RESEARCH symptomatic persons, gametocyte prevalence was always low, and it decreased before introduction of co-artemether, but it did not decrease to undetectable levels in Kipsamoite until after introduction of co-artemether. Among asymp-tomatic persons, studies during 1999–2002 generally dem-onstrated higher gametocyte prevalence (0%–5.7%) ( 7). Lower prevalence among asymptomatic persons in the cur-rent study (0%–0.2% during May 2007–April 2008) could reﬂ ect effects of co-artemether on gametocyte prevalence after introduction of co-artemether in late 2006–early 2007, but without interim data from 2002–2006, an association cannot be clearly demonstrated. As with IRS, however, ab-sence of microscopy-positive malaria cases occurred only after introduction of co-artemether. Because co-artemether was ﬁ rst used during a time of low transmission of malaria, the contribution of ACT to the absence of malaria incidence could not be quanti ﬁ ed in the present study. However, a much larger study in South Africa in which IRS treatment and ACT treatment of persons with clinical malaria were introduced sequentially demonstrated an additional reduc-tion of malaria incidence after introduction of ACT ( 14) and this supports the idea of synergy between these 2 in-terventions. Although ITNs are the preferred intervention for pre- venting malaria-related illness and death in areas of high transmission ( 1,15,16), ITNs probably did not play a major role in interrupting malaria transmission in the highland ar-eas we studied. ITN coverage never exceeded 30% in either area, and use actually decreased over the study period. In areas of unstable transmission, IRS treatment once a year is likely to be easier, more effective, and more accepted than ITNs. The Roll Back Malaria program currently rec-ommends IRS as the preferred method of reducing malaria in areas of low transmission ( 17); our study supports this recommendation. Insecticide treatment using IRS is not without prob- lems; chief among them is potential development of resis-tance to the insecticide. Lambda-cyhalothrin, the insecti-cide used for IRS in these areas by the Kenyan Ministry of Health, was used in Mozambique for IRS starting in 1993, but resistance developed to such an extent that lambda cy-halothrin was replaced by bendiocarb in 2000. By 2006, however, lambda cyhalothrin resistance had decreased in many areas ( 18). In a recent study in nearby areas of west- ern Kenya, no phenotypic resistance to pyrethroid insecti-cides was seen, but 27% of anophelines carried the knock-down resistance ( kdr) mutation associated with increased resistance to pyrethroids ( 19). Assessment for insecticide resistance in the highland areas of the present study will enable better policy decisions to be made about continued use of lambda cyhalothrin, use of alternatives such as ben-diocarb or DDT, or cycling of insecticides when certain re-sistance thresholds are reached for a particular insecticide. P. falciparum resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was present in 27% of infections in western Kenya as early 1922 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 Figure 2.

Possible Interruption of Malaria Transmission as 1999 ( 20). Resistance to co-artemether has not yet been documented in Kenya, but development of resistance to components of artemether/lumefantrine in nearby popula-tions with higher levels of transmission would also pose a threat to this highland population. Monitoring of drug resis-tance to ACT in all areas in which malaria is endemic will be critical for sustaining reduction of malaria incidence in sub-Saharan Africa. Limitations of our study include missing monthly ma- laria incidence data among symptomatic persons during 2005–2006, the observational nature of the study, and the possibility that lack of parasitemia by microscopy and PCR in symptomatic and asymptomatic persons was caused by seasonal variation common in highland areas ( 21) and not by interruption of local transmission. However, 3 pieces of evidence from studies of asymptomatic and symptomatic persons support interruption of local transmission rather than seasonal variation. First, no parasitemia was seen in 2 successive microscopy and PCR surveys of asymptom-atic persons, whereas in 5 earlier surveys of asymptomatic persons in Kipsamoite, the area of lower transmission, the frequency of infected persons was never zero (range 5.9%–14.5% by PCR) ( 7). Second, over 7 years of clinic surveil- lance of symptomatic persons in Kipsamoite and 5 years in Kapsisiywa, there was never a >4-month period in which there were no microscopy-positive cases of P. falciparum before March 2007. Thus, even with seasonal variation, a year with no microscopy-positive cases in these areas is unprecedented. Third, absence of gametocytemia by mi-croscopy was documented among asymptomatic persons in 2 of 4 assessments and among symptomatic persons for a year (April 2007–March 2008), which suggested that the potential for local transmission was low or absent.Because reverse transcription–PCR methods for de- tection of gametocytes have documented higher rates of gametocyte infection than microscopy ( 22,23), we are de- veloping this testing method in our laboratory to con ﬁ rm the absence of gametocytemia in the most recent samples from study participants. The presence of asexual P. falci- parum infection by PCR in 15 symptomatic persons during April–June 2007 could re ﬂ ect prolonged detection by this more sensitive method. The presence of only 2 PCR-pos-itive cases in a 9-month period (July 2007–March 2008) suggests that malaria transmission was either interrupted, if these cases were caused by patients’ travel, or reduced to almost undetectable levels. Sustained elimination of local malaria transmission in these areas will require ongoing surveillance of malaria in-cidence, anopheline vector density, and anopheline insec-ticide resistance, and correctly timed IRS campaigns with broad coverage of the area ( 24). The longer populations at these sites are unexposed to malaria, the more suscep-tible they are to malaria epidemics, which could occur if an increase in vector density occurs in conjunction with the arrival of infected persons or mosquitoes from an area of higher transmission of malaria. Because travel is increas-ingly frequent, true elimination of malaria in this and other highland areas will require reduction and eventual elimina-tion of malaria in surrounding areas. Co-artemether must be consistently available to treat any infected and symptomatic travelers or immigrants to the area. Finally, as malaria cas-es decrease, microscopists will need to receive training to remain pro ﬁ cient in detection of malaria in blood smears. In summary, this study demonstrates pronounced re- duction and possible interruption of malaria transmission in 2 highland areas of Kenya for a 1-year period and pro- Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1923 Table 4.

RESEARCH vides evidence that interruption of transmission was related to widespread annual IRS insecticide treatment and use of ACT as ﬁ rst-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. Al- though both areas remain at risk for recurrence of malaria epidemics, our study provides evidence that interruption and eventual elimination of malaria in areas of unstable transmission may be achievable.

Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylo- coccus aureus (CA-MRSA) has become a major problem in US hospitals already dealing with high levels of hospital-as-sociated MRSA (HA-MRSA). Using antimicrobial drug sus-ceptibility data for 1999–2006 from The Surveillance Net-work, we characterized the relationship between outpatient and inpatient levels of CA-MRSA nationally. In outpatients, the frequency of CA-MRSA isolates has increased >7× dur-ing 1999–2006, which suggests that outpatients have be-come a major reservoir for CA-MRSA. However, contrary to results in other reports, although CA-MRSA increases are associated with decreases in the frequency of HA-MRSA in hospitals, the decreases are only modest. This ﬁ nding suggests that instead of replacing HA-MRSA in the hospi-tal, CA-MRSA is adding to the overall presence of MRSA already found within the hospital population. The past decade has seen a large increase in infections with hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylo- coccus aureus (HA-MRSA) ( 1). MRSA is one of the most common causes of nosocomial infections, especially inva-sive bacterial infections ( 2), and is now endemic and even epidemic to many US hospitals, long-term care facilities ( 3), and communities ( 4–6).

RESEARCH MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains have been recognized as a lead- ing cause of skin and soft tissue infections ( 1,6), especially in patients with no established healthcare risk factors ( 7,8), they also cause severe invasive infections ( 9,10). Recent reports based on genotypic evidence have suggested that CA-MRSA is likely spreading within hospitals as well, blurring the line between CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA infections ( 11). Molecular typing studies have identi ﬁ ed 2 MRSA clones, USA300 and USA400, as the primary types that cause CA-MRSA infections ( 12). Evidence suggests that emergence of these strains was independent of hospital strains ( 13). Thus, understanding the role of outpatients, who are among the likely carriers of CA-MRSA into a hospital, is useful for understanding the changing epide-miology of MRSA in hospitals. Outpatients, who outnum-ber inpatients by ≈3:1, may play a major role in the spread of CA-MRSA strains from the community to the hospital through their interaction with hospital staff or use of similar hospital resources, such as surgical rooms. However, lim-ited information hinders understanding of long-term trends in CA-MRSA in outpatients in the context of changing epi-demiology of inpatients. This lack of information hinders the ability to evaluate infection control methods in the face of a possible emerging epidemic of nosocomial infections caused by CA-MRSA. Knowledge of trends in antimicrobial drug resistance rates for emerging pathogens are useful to clinicians to en-sure high-quality care, which is essential for antimicrobial drug therapy, in which different drugs can have different costs and effectiveness. These trends can also help hospital administrators and policy makers make infection control investments to address the role that large in ﬂ uxes of outpa- tients with CA-MRSA infections may play with regard to overall MRSA infection rates in the hospital. Methods To analyze trends in frequency of CA-MRSA and HA- MRSA, we studied changes in the proportion of isolates of each type that were found in inpatient and outpatient settings from a nationally representative sample of US hospitals dur-ing 1999–2006. Although genotypic analysis is the most reli-able way of identifying MRSA strains, historical genotypic data on isolates are not available at the national level. An al-ternative approach is to ascertain strain type by using pheno-typic susceptibility pro ﬁ les. S. aureus susceptibility pro ﬁ les are determined by the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) types on which the methicillin resistance gene, mecA, is carried. Because CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA strains typi-cally have different SCC mec types, rules have been devel- oped for determining the likely genetic makeup of an isolate on the basis of susceptibility results ( 11,14–16). Phenotypic susceptibility results were obtained from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA (Focus Diagnostics, Herndon, VA, USA). TSN is an electronic repository of antimicrobial drug susceptibility data from a national network of >300 microbiology laboratories in the United States. Participating laboratories are geographically dispersed and make up a nationally representative sample based on patient population and number of beds. Patient isolates are tested on site as part of routine diagnostic test-ing for susceptibility to different antimicrobial agents by using standards established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( 17) and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Results are then ﬁ ltered to remove repeat isolates and identify microbiologically atypical re-sults for con ﬁ rmation or veri ﬁ cation before being included in the TSN database. Data from the database have been used extensively to evaluate antimicrobial drug resistance patterns and trends ( 1,18–22). Genotypic analysis of phenotypically de ﬁ ned strains has found that in general, isolates of the USA300 strain, the one most commonly associated with CA-MRSA infec-tions, are resistant to fewer antimicrobial drugs ( 14–16). Naimi et al. ( 15) tested genetically determined CA-MRSA isolates against several antimicrobial drugs and found that they were typically susceptible to cipro ﬂ oxacin (79%) and clindamycin (83%). Similarly, King et al. ( 14) found that 88% of CA-MRSA strains were resistant only to a β-lactam and erythromycin or a β-lactam only. Popovich et al. ( 16) also found that susceptibility to a ﬂ uoroquinolone had a 90% positive predictive value for predicting a community-associated strain. Additionally, the number of antimicro-bial drugs to which an isolate was susceptible was a reliable predictor of the genotype ( 16). We analyzed S. aureus isolates that were tested for susceptibility to oxacillin (a proxy for all β-lactam anti- microbial drugs). Isolates classi ﬁ ed as resistant according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint criteria were considered MRSA (<0.01% had intermedi-ate resistance and were classi ﬁ ed as susceptible). MRSA isolates, regardless of source (outpatient or inpatient), that were tested against cipro ﬂ oxacin or clindamycin, and >3 other drugs and found to be resistant only to oxacillin were classi ﬁ ed as CA-MRSA strains. Isolates resistant to oxa- cillin and >1 other drug were assumed to be HA-MRSA strains. Other drugs tested were gentamicin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and vancomycin. Using this framework, we determined that the mean number of outpatient isolates analyzed annually was >50,000. Isolates were strati ﬁ ed on the basis of source (blood, lungs, skin, and other organs). Con ﬁ dence inter- vals (CIs) for TSN data were calculated by using the Wil-son score method incorporating continuity correction as detailed by Newcombe ( 23). Statistical analysis was per- formed by using Stata version 10 software (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). 1926 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009

CA-MRSA in Outpatients, United States, 1999–2006 Results Susceptibility to clindamycin, cipro ﬂ oxacin, gentami- cin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and van-comycin was used to infer genotypes of MRSA isolates during 1999–2006. During this period, there was a statisti-cally signi ﬁ cant reduction (p<0.001) in the proportion of MRSA isolates in outpatient areas resistant to cipro ﬂ oxa- cin (84% to 56%), clindamycin (67% to 30%), gentamicin (30% to 3%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (16% to 2%). Our phenotypic rule, which was based on suscepti-bility to all drugs, found qualitatively similar results, with the proportion of MRSA isolates resistant to >1 other drug decreasing from 87% to 46% during the period (Figure). For outpatient data, the proportion of all S. aureus in- fections that were MRSA infections nearly doubled, from 26.8% (95% CI 26.3%–27.3%) to 52.4% (95% CI 52.0%–52.9%), over the study period. This increase was caused almost entirely by increases in isolates resistant only to oxacillin, which increased >7× from 3.6% (95% CI 3.5%–3.7%) to 28.2% (95% CI 28.0%–28.5%). The proportion of isolates resistant only to oxacillin increased for skin and soft tissue infections. However, increases were also observed in invasive blood and lung infections and other infections. Isolates resistant to >1 other drug increased ≈5% during 1999–2001 from 23.2% (95% CI 23.0%–23.5%) to 28.2% (95% CI 28.0%–28.5%) before reaching a plateau. In 2005, the proportion of isolates resistant to oxacillin and 1 other drug then decreased back to almost the same percentage it started at. This pattern was driven by overall increases at all infection sites during 1999–2001 and later decreases at all collection sites except skin infections (Table). Among inpatients, the proportion of S. aureus iso- lates that were MRSA increased 25% from 46.7% (95% CI 46.2%–47.2%) to 58.5% (95% CI 58.0%–58.9%). Again, the increase was driven primarily by increases in the rate of isolates resistant only to oxacillin, which increased >7× from 3.3% (95% CI 3.1%–3.4%) to 19.8% (95% CI 19.4%–20.1%). Similar to outpatient data, the frequency of skin and soft tissue infections increased for isolates resis-tant only to oxacillin, although increases in blood, lung, and other infections were also observed. For isolates resistant to >1 other drug, a slightly different pattern was observed than for the pattern of outpatient isolate resistance. Instead of a large increase, the proportion of MRSA isolates resistant to >1 drug remained the same ( ≈43%–44%) until 2003 be- fore decreasing >5% from 44.1% (95% CI 43.7%–44.5%) to 38.5% (95% CI 38.2%–38.9%) during 2003–2005. This decrease was largely caused by reductions in lung infec-tions, although decreases were also seen in blood and other infections. Also different was the increase in MRSA skin isolates resistant to multiple drugs. There was an increase from 1999, but the increase was less (only 3%–4%) and ap-peared to plateau at ≈12%–13%.Discussion We found during 1999–2006 that the percentage of S. aureus infections resistant to methicillin increased >90%, or ≈10% a year, in outpatients admitted to US hospitals. This increase was caused almost entirely by CA-MRSA strains, which increased >33% annually. Increases in the proportion of HA-MRSA isolates among outpatients were more variable, increasing ≈10% per year during 1999–2001 before the increase slowed; the proportion then decreased over the second half of the study period. This reduction in the growth of HA-MRSA isolates corresponds to a steep increase in the frequency of CA-MRSA skin and soft tis-sue infections among outpatients over an extremely short period, mostly during 2003–2005. The frequency of CA-MRSA among inpatients in- creased nearly in conjunction with outpatient rates, over-all and at each infection site. However, increases in blood and lung infections increased more among inpatients than in outpatients, which likely re ﬂ ected the more severe status and increased likelihood of open wounds in inpa-tients. During this same period, rates of HA-MRSA de-creased only ≈10%. Most of this decrease occurred during 2003–2005 and was mainly the result of a decrease in the frequency of HA-MRSA lung infections. This decrease was more likely the result of changes in empirical antimi-crobial drug therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia (24) than a consequence of any changes in the epidemiol- ogy of MRSA. Despite increases in the proportion of CA-MRSA strains among inpatients, the continuing high level of HA- Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1927 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006% ResistantCiprofloxacin Clindamycin Gentamicin Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim Multiple drugs Figure.

RESEARCH MRSA suggests that in contrast to reports from local insti- tutions ( 11), CA-MRSA strains are adding to the problem of MRSA rather than replacing HA-MRSA strains. The fact that the frequency of HA-MRSA has decreased implies that some crowding out of HA-MRSA strains within the hospi-tal may be occurring. However, lack of a decrease suggests that within the hospital, HA-MRSA strains may be more ﬁ t, and thus CA-MRSA strains are unable to replace them fully. The result is a coexistence of both strains in the hos-pital and maintenance of CA-MRSA because of the large inﬂ ux of colonized and infected patients. This ﬁ nding is consistent with the biology of the 2 strains, which suggests differential ﬁ tness on the basis of the size of SCC mec. In CA-MRSA strains, the predominant SCC mec elements are types IV and V, which are small- er than the SCC mec types typically found in HA-MRSA strains. These smaller genetic elements may increase the ﬁ tness of CA-MRSA strains outside hospital-related anti- microbial drug pressures, presumably by increasing mo-bility and growth potential ( 25). However, their increased susceptibility to antibacterial agents in the hospital leaves them at a ﬁ tness disadvantage. The result is that, although the community has effectively become a reservoir for the CA-MRSA strains that are continually introduced into the hospital population, without genetic changes, they are un-likely to replace HA-MRSA strains in the hospital. The large proportion of infections caused by CA-MR- SA strains in hospitals with high frequencies of HA-MRSA has implications for drug-prescribing patterns within hos-pitals. Because CA-MRSA strains are generally susceptible to more antimicrobial drugs, persons with these infections may be able to be treated with less expensive antimicrobial drugs with fewer adverse outcomes. Moreover, appropriate therapy can reduce the likelihood of emergence of other re-sistant pathogens, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococ-ci. Initial empiric therapy of infections with the suspected etiology of CA-MRSA must be tailored to antimicrobial drug susceptibility patterns within the local community and be based on ef ﬁ cacy studies that suggest speci ﬁ c effective- ness targets. Kaplan suggested that empiric therapy should be mod- iﬁ ed if >10%–15% of CA-MRSA isolates become resistant 1928 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Table.

CA-MRSA in Outpatients, United States, 1999–2006 to a speci ﬁ c empiric therapy ( 26). Conversely, it may be appropriate to reintroduce a speci ﬁ c agent when suscepti- bility levels increase above a threshold. However, cycling strategies may not always be optimal ( 27), and no ef ﬁ cacy studies have been conducted to establish this target. In ad-dition, we urge caution in applying national results to the CA-MRSA antibiogram of a speci ﬁ c area. Although results showed an overall trend at the national level, speci ﬁ c re- sults at individual testing centers tended to be more vari-able. Moreover, local health of ﬁ cials and hospitals should coordinate their efforts to identify susceptibility patterns at the community level, rather than at the hospital level, to optimize the gains from investments in infection control (28). The results of our study should be interpreted with cau- tion because TSN provides information concerning only the site of isolate collection and not the infection. In addition, TSN only provides information on the collection location (i.e., outpatient or inpatient) and not case histories. Thus, some isolates may be dif ﬁ cult to classify in situations such as when an isolate was collected in the emergency depart-ment and then the patient was admitted or the patient was discharged and then returned as an outpatient. However, the effect of these situations is likely to be small because most isolates are from patients who can be classi ﬁ ed as in- patients or outpatients. A further limitation of the study is that although CA- MRSA isolate drug susceptibility patterns are technically genetically determined, the data enabled only phenotypic classi ﬁ cation of isolates. In addition, as with any large time-series database, changes in surveillance or bias in the types of infections cultured over time, such as more severe or unusual infections, could alter the results. These ﬁ ndings suggest that more complicated bacteriology could alter the results. However, no general trend in the number of isolates collected was seen at individual testing centers, and resis-tance results from the TSN database were comparable to results of other national studies ( 1). Furthermore, the strik- ing increases over the study period suggest that the trends are likely robust to any bias. In summary, we examined the frequency of CA-MR- SA and HA-MRSA in inpatient and outpatient settings. Our results indicate that outpatients may be a major reservoir of CA-MRSA, which will continue to enter hospitals, exac-erbating the problem of MRSA. However, although CA-MRSA isolates have undoubtedly spread within hospitals and are likely to continue to do so, without changes in the ﬁ tness of different strains, CA-MRSA strains are unlikely to displace HA-MRSA strains within the hospital. Our ﬁ ndings have implications for local and national policies aimed at containing and preventing MRSA. More rapid diagnostic methods are urgently needed to better aid physicians in determining appropriate empiric therapy. Strategies for prevention of infection and treatment of pa-tients with CA-MRSA within healthcare settings should be coordinated primarily at the local level in accordance with local susceptibility pro ﬁ les. Lastly, infection control poli- cies should take into account the role that outpatients likely play in the spread of MRSA and promote interventions that could prevent spread of MRSA from outpatient areas to in-patient areas.

To evaluate risk factors for infection with highly patho- genic avian in ﬂ uenza A virus (H5N1) in backyard chickens in Bangladesh, we conducted a matched case–control study. We enrolled 25 case farms (cases March–November 2007) and 75 control farms (June–November 2007). We used a questionnaire to collect farm data, which were analyzed by matched-pair analysis and multivariate conditional logistic regression. Factors independently associated were offer-ing slaughter remnants of purchased chickens to backyard chickens (odds ratio [OR] 13.29, 95% con ﬁ dence interval [CI] 1.34–131.98, p = 0.027), having a nearby water body (OR 5.27, 95% CI 1.24–22.34, p = 0.024), and having con-tact with pigeons (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.14–17.50, p = 0.032). Separating chickens and ducks at night was protective (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01–0.45, p = 0.006). Reducing these risks and taking protective measures might reduce the risk for inﬂ uenza (H5N1) infection in backyard chickens. Highly pathogenic avian in ﬂ uenza (HPAI) A virus (H5N1) is a deadly zoonotic pathogen; from 1997 through 2008, a total of 413 human cases were reported in 15 countries, and 256 persons died ( 1). By March 2008, the virus had been identi ﬁ ed in birds in 61 countries ( 2). The persistence of the virus in poultry over a wide geographic area strengthens the hypothesis that a mutant virus might evolve and initiate a human pandemic. To reduce this threat, every country should have a surveillance system for detecting the virus in poultry, including backyard ﬂ ocks. Worldwide, poultry production has recently undergone rapid change, including the introduction of intensive pro-duction, new breeds, improved biosecurity, and preventive health measures. In developing countries, however, adop-tion of this type of production has been limited because of the costs of infrastructures to maintain biosecurity for birds, quality hybrid chicks, balanced feed, biologics, and quality veterinary care ( 3). Up to 80% of the poultry in Af- rica and Asia are kept in backyard-type systems ( 3,4), and these birds represent a substantial economic resource for impoverished rural populations. In Bangladesh, ≈89% of rural households have back- yard poultry ( 5), and many households keep chickens and ducks on the same property ( 6). In the absence of fences or other barriers, backyard chickens roam freely from one property to another. Because backyard chickens are reared in such free-range systems, they are more vulnerable to the HPAI (H5N1) virus infection; and, if they become infect-ed, they can transmit the virus to domestic ducks, in which the virus can perpetuate ( 7–9) and infect more backyard chickens. This cycle of virus transmission between back-yard chickens and ducks would continue until intercepted. HPAI (H5N1) virus in backyard chickens also poses a seri-ous threat to public health because of the frequent and close contacts between poultry and humans.

RESEARCH virus infection in backyard chickens in any parts of the world, and to our knowledge, nothing has been published about the risk factors in Bangladesh. Because understand-ing the risk factors for the virus in backyard chickens and preventive measures might slow or prevent the spread of the virus, we conducted a case-control study to determine the risk factors for HPAI (H5N1) virus infection in back-yard chickens in Bangladesh. Materials and Methods Study Population and Case De ﬁ nition Bangladesh is composed of 4,500 unions (local gov- ernment units that comprise several villages) and 90,500 villages ( 10). Of the total poultry population in the country (≈222 million birds), 50% are backyard poultry, predomi- nantly indigenous (nondescriptive) chickens and mostly reared in free-range systems on the homesteads in these villages ( 10). In Bangladesh, villagers sometime rear Fay- oumi and Sonali (a cross-bred F1 generation of Fayoumi [female] and Rhode Island Red [male]) chickens in a semi-scavenging system ( 11–13) and occasionally in intensive systems. All 25 HPAI outbreaks recorded in indigenous (n = 20 farms), Fayoumi (n = 2), and Sonali (n = 5) chick-ens in village areas in Bangladesh by November 17, 2007, were considered outbreaks in backyard chickens, and the farms were enrolled in our study as case backyard farms. By date of onset of clinical signs, the ﬁ rst outbreak of HPAI in backyard chickens was recorded on March 22, 2007, the date on which Bangladesh was of ﬁ cially declared HPAI (H5N1) virus infected. In 2007, the numbers of backyard farms infected were 1 farm in March, 3 in April, 7 in May, 7 in June, 2 in July, 1 in September, 3 in October, and 1 in November. A case backyard farm was de ﬁ ned as one that had a high chicken mortality rate and on which in ﬂ uenza vi- rus A subtype H5 was detected from tracheal samples of 2 chickens by reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) using a primer set hemagglutinin (HA) oligo 5 ′ (5′- ACACATGCYCARGACATACT-3 ′) and HA oligo 3 ′ (5′-CTYTGRTTYAGTGTTGATGT-3 ′), as described by Lee et al. ( 14). Testing was done at the National Refer- ence Laboratory for Avian In ﬂ uenza in Bangladesh. Case reporting of HPAI (H5N1) in chickens in Bangladesh and detailed laboratory diagnosis, including diagnostic recon-ﬁ rmation from the Veterinary Laboratory Agency in the United Kingdom, has been described ( 15). For each case farm, we selected and enrolled 3 control backyard farms, each of which was within 1–10 km of a case farm. Each unaffected village in this zone of selec-tion was assigned a unique number, and 2 were randomly selected by lottery. One villager from each selected village was asked to give 10 names of the backyard farm own-ers in the village who had reared village chickens for >1 year. These 10 names with distinct numbers were used as the sample frame for the village. From the sample frame of the ﬁ rst selected village, we randomly chose 2 backyard farm owners who had adult chickens (>6 months of age) and chicks (<1 month of age) and whose chickens had not died during the clinical phase of HPAI on the case farm. Likewise, 1 backyard farm owner was selected from the sample of the second village. To ﬁ nd control farms with Sonali or Fayoumi chickens, the same (1–10 km) zone of selection was used, but the names of the farm owners were drawn from the local upazila (a lower administrative unit in Bangladesh) veterinary of ﬁ ce and used as the sample from which to randomly select 3 farms. Because biologics were scarce, serologic testing to con ﬁ rm the noninfected status of the control farms was not attempted. Global positioning system coordinates from the case and control farms were collected during farm visits and en-tered into a digitized map of Bangladesh. A geographic in-formation system program (Arc View 9.1; Environmental System Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA) was used (Figure). Data Collection and Survey Method A questionnaire designed for this study was pretested at 5 case farms. The questionnaire was then modi ﬁ ed ac- cording to new variables encountered during pretesting. In the ﬁ nal questionnaire, 59 variables were surveyed (spread- sheet available from P.K.B.). The questionnaire was then administered on the case and control farms by 2 veterinar-ians trained to administer questionnaires; they interviewed farm owners or, if owners were absent, any adult family members. Variables collected addressed geographic loca-tion, stock information, ﬂ ock health history, and overall farm management. All interviews were conducted in Ben-gali, the only spoken language in the study area, during June–November 2007. Statistical Analysis The collected data were entered into a spread sheet program (Excel; Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and transferred into Epi Info 2000 (Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) for analysis. To estimate the strength and statistical signi ﬁ cance of associa- tions between risk factors and HPAI (H5N1) virus infec-tion, we used the Mantel-Haenszel matched-pair analysis (McNemar) test. An association was considered signi ﬁ cant if 2-sided tests of signi ﬁ cance had a p value <0.05. To ex- amine independence of effects, we conducted multivariate conditional logistic regression using the conditional logis-tic regression (CLogit) function in Stata 9.0 for Windows (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). Any variables with p<0.2 after matched-pair analysis were included in 1932 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009

HPAI in Backyard Chickens, Bangladesh the initial model. A backward stepwise variable–selection strategy was used to construct a ﬁ nal model with a signi ﬁ - cance level of p<0.05. Results Population Statistics Indigenous, Fayoumi, and Sonali chickens were raised on 20, 2, and 3 backyard farms, respectively. Median num-ber (and range) of indigenous chickens was 24 (3–88) on case farms and 14 (5–50) on control farms and of Fayoumi/Sonali chickens was 950 (125–1,970) on case farms and 2,200 (1,500–3,500) on control farms. Chickens of various ages (mean 35.7 weeks [range 3.5–130]) were raised on 10 of the case farms, but precise ages of chickens on 15 case farms were not provided by the owners; 6 said they had only adult chickens, and 9 said they had adult chickens and young chicks. Adult and young indigenous chickens were raised on the 60 control farms. Matched-Pair Analysis The results of matched-pair analysis (Table 1) showed that offering slaughter remnants of purchased chickens to backyard chickens (within 21 days of the onset clinical signs in case farms) had the strongest point estimate of ef-fect (matched odds ratio [OR] 22.1) and high statistical sig-niﬁ cance (p<0.001) despite wide 95% con ﬁ dence intervals (CIs) of 2.7–177.7. Other factors positively associated with case farms were migratory birds around a farm (OR 7.5, 95% CI 1.5–38.7, p = 0.010), rodents on the farm (OR 5.8, 95% CI 2.0–16.8, p = 0.001), contact with pigeons (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.9–16.0, p = 0.001), and a nearby body of water (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.5–9.5, p = 0.004). Protective factors (OR <1) for case backyard farms were placing chickens and ducks in different shelters at night (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.1–0.5, p = 0.001) and having a commercial farm within 0.5 km (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.9, p = 0.028). Multivariate Analysis Eight variables with p<0.2 were considered for inclu- sion in the conditional logistic regression model to estimate independence of effects (Table 2). The ﬁ nal conditional lo- gistic regression model identi ﬁ ed 3 variables as indepen- dent risk factors for HPAI (H5N1) infection of backyard chickens in Bangladesh (Table 3). They were 1) offering slaughter remnants of purchased chickens to backyard chickens (within 21 days of the clinical onset of the dis-ease) (OR 13.29, 95% CI 1.34–131.98), 2) having nearby body of water (OR 5.27, 95% CI 1.24–22.34), and 3) hav-ing contact with pigeons (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.14–17.50) . The ﬁ nal model also identi ﬁ ed a protective factor: placing chickens and ducks in different shelters at night (OR 0.06 95% CI 0.01–0.45). Discussion We used analytic epidemiologic techniques to un- veil the possible risk factors associated with in ﬂ uenza (H5N1) infection for backyard chickens in Bangladesh so that effective risk management can be advocated. A few published reports quantify the risk factors for in ﬂ uenza (H5N1) infections in commercial chickens ( 16,17), but to our knowledge, analytic epidemiologic reports quantifying risk factors for backyard chickens are few, if any. The re-sults of this study should contribute to the understanding of risk factors associated with in ﬂ uenza (H5N1) infections in backyard chickens in other developing countries, particu-larly in southern Asia. Although only 1 case of in ﬂ uenza (H5N1) in a human has been reported in Bangladesh, the country’s poultry sec-tor has been severely affected; by July 2009, a total of 325 outbreaks had been reported in chickens, 51 of which were in backyard chickens (www.mo ﬂ .gov.bd/daily_bird ﬂ u_re- port.pdf). Because of limited manpower, the country re-lies predominantly on passive surveillance to detect HPAI outbreaks in chickens. Thus, the possibility of unreported cases occurring in backyard chickens in some parts of the Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1933 Figure.

RESEARCH country cannot be ruled out. These hidden and unreported infections in backyard chickens can help perpetuate the virus, posing a serious challenge to eradication efforts. Strengthening active instead of passive surveillance and generating awareness at the rural level of risk factors for the HPAI (H5N1) virus infection in backyard chickens, and their management, might help reduce the virus load in poultry in the country. Stalls with live poultry can be found at virtually every kitchen or village market in Bangladesh. At the local mar-kets, villagers can sell their poultry to local persons or to poultry vendors, who buy poultry in bulk to sell at larger city markets. When villagers fear a disease outbreak, they start selling apparently healthy and even clinically diseased chickens. Diseased chickens are cheaper, encouraging other villagers to buy them for meat. They purchase live chickens and slaughter them at home. They then offer the slaugh-ter remnants, inedible for humans, to their own backyard chickens, which scavenge and forage around the slaughter places. Such practice occurred at 8 (32%) case farms <21 days of the onset of the clinical signs (Table 1); this prac-tice appears to be strongest risk factor for HPAI (H5N1) infection in backyard chickens in Bangladesh. Another risk factor was domestic ducks, which are considered a “Trojan horse” for the HPAI (H5N1) virus (7–9). Their main feed sources are vegetation, small ﬁ sh, amphibians, snails, oysters, and other crustaceans, found in and around water. The water bodies and their banks might become contaminated with the HPAI (H5N1) virus by vi-rus-shedding ducks that congregate at these places. Back-yard chickens might be exposed to the virus while sharing the same banks near the body of water, which could explain why a nearby body water appeared to be an independent risk factor. The in ﬂ uence of 2 kinds of bodies of water on the HPAI outbreaks in backyard chickens was assessed by in- 1934 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Table 1.

HPAI in Backyard Chickens, Bangladesh corporating 2 variables: 1) presence of a nearby (<0.1 km) body of water and 2) distance <0.5 km from a larger body of water. The latter variable was meant for any larger wa-ter-logged paddy or open ﬁ eld, lagoon, marsh, river, lake, or canal where water and migratory birds live or take ref-uge. These bodies of water are sometimes shared by do-mestic ducks; but generally, ducks on backyard farms feed on nearby bodies of water, predominantly ponds made by the birds’ owners for household purposes or aquaculture. Secondarily, ducks roam in these ponds to collect feed. Presence of a larger body of water within 0.5 km of a back-yard farm seems to have no causal association with the oc-currence of HPAI in backyard chickens in Bangladesh, but the presence of a nearby pond might. In 1997, domestic pigeons ( Columbia spp.) were largely resistant to infection with an HPAI (H5N1) virus isolated from Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People’s Republic of China ( 18); other studies showed that they appeared to be more resistant to infection than many other avian species ( 19,20). In Bangladesh, many backyard farmers rear chickens, ducks, pigeons, and sometimes other poultry in groups of mixed ages. Domestic pigeons are a major source of meat in Bangladesh, and not 1 pigeon in the country has been reported dead of in ﬂ uenza (H5N1) infection. The risk factor of contact with pigeons included 2 categories: the owners’ own domestic pigeons and neigh-bors’ visiting pigeons. In a complex of backyard farms in Bangladesh, pigeons are allowed to feed with other farm poultry; in addition, pigeons of 1 backyard farm frequently visit others for additional feed. Oronasal secretions and fe-ces from sick, or dead, backyard chickens with HPAI, have a high virus titer, thereby polluting the farm. Pigeons’ feed-ing and behavior probably allows them to come in close contact with the secretions of the infected or dead chick-ens or with fomites, enabling them to transmit the virus mechanically. Nettles et al. ( 21) reported that pigeons and some wild birds—crows, mourning doves, vultures, and others—are not responsible for dissemination of in ﬂ uenza virus (H5N2) among poultry farms. However, in contrast to the ﬁ ndings of Nettles et al. ( 21), dead crows in different areas of Bangladesh were found to be positive for in ﬂ uenza virus (H5) (neuraminidase was not determined) ( 22). Be- cause of the lack of evidence of mechanical transmission of inﬂ uenza virus (H5N1) through pigeons in backyard chick-ens, the hypothesis that they are mechanical transmitters of inﬂ uenza virus (H5N1) under the prevailing conditions of backyard chicken farms in Bangladesh cannot be con-ﬁ rmed without a thorough virologic study. Some owners also offer supplementary feeds, predom- inantly cereals or their byproducts, to their chickens and ducks, usually in the evening when they are placed in the night shelters to protect them from predators. No domestic duck in Bangladesh has been reported dead of in ﬂ uenza vi- rus (H5N1) infection. Placing chickens and ducks in sepa-rate night shelters appeared to be a protective factor. On the contrary, an association with in ﬂ uenza (H5N1) was found with rearing them on the same farm. In developing countries, including Bangladesh, bios- ecurity enhancement, according to the Food and Agricul-ture Organization of the United Nations, poultry produc-tion system 4 is impossible to adopt. However, practical ways to minimize the risk factors identi ﬁ ed in this study are possible in these countries, as follows. Chickens must not be fed remnants of slaughtered chickens that have been purchased from markets or mobile poultry vendors, and inedible portions thus produced must be disposed of hy-gienically. Villagers should not buy any obviously or ap-parently sick chickens, although they are cheaper, because these birds pose a serious threat to the villagers’ health and to the health of their backyard chickens. Enactment of laws with punitive measures for selling clinically sick chick-ens anywhere in the country and strict implementation of these laws are vital for limiting the spread of the virus from live bird markets to backyard chickens and vice versa. In-dividual backyard farm owners should be encouraged to rear only chickens or ducks; but if that is impractical, the owners should be advised to construct separate night shel-ters for ducks and chickens. Chickens should be limited or prevented from scavenging along the banks of bodies of water. During feeding, a family member can prevent pi-geons from joining the ﬂ ock; any remaining feed must be removed carefully. Because backyard chickens are a vital economic re- source in Bangladesh, backyard farmers cannot be pre-vented from rearing them. Therefore, avoidance of the risk factors identi ﬁ ed in this study, and implementation of pro- tective factors, might reduce the risk for in ﬂ uenza (H5N1) infection in backyard chickens in the country.

Summer outbreaks of tularemia that occurred from 1995 through 2005 in 2 locations in Sweden affected 441 persons. We performed an epidemiologic investigation of these outbreaks using a novel strategy, involving high-reso-lution genotyping of Francisella tularensis isolates obtained from 136 patients (using 18 genetic markers developed from 6 F. tularensis genome sequences) and interviews with the patients. Strong spatial associations were found between F. tularensis subpopulations and the places of disease trans- mission; infection by some subpopulations occurred within areas as small as 2 km 2, indicating unidenti ﬁ ed environmen- tal point sources of tularemia. In both locations, disease clusters were associated with recreational areas beside water, and genetic subpopulations were present throughout the tularemia season and persisted over years. High-reso-lution genotyping in combination with patients’ statements about geographic places of disease transmission provided valuable indications of likely sources of infection and the causal genotypes during these tularemia outbreaks. Traditional objectives of investigations of infectious disease outbreaks are to identify ways to control ongo- ing outbreaks and to prevent future outbreaks. However, a paucity of epidemiologic and ecologic knowledge ham-pers the investigation of tularemia outbreaks caused by the intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis , although it is one of the most virulent pathogens known. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists this pathogen as one of the most potentially dangerous bioterrorism bacteria (1). Little is known about natural reservoirs of tularemia, F. tularensis transmission mechanisms to humans, and fac- tors in ﬂ uencing the often irregular pattern of outbreaks. Because tularemia is a zoonosis and little ecologic infor-mation exists about the causal organism, its prevention and control may require the development of novel outbreak in-vestigation strategies. In nature, F. tularensis is associated with an extremely wide range of hosts and arthropod vectors; a recent review listed 304 susceptible species ( 2). Transmission to humans may occur through a number of routes; skin inoculation by blood-feeding arthropod vectors is one of the most com-mon routes ( 3). The infectious dose can be as low as 10 bacterial cells ( 4). Human tularemia naturally occurs only in biotopes in the Northern Hemisphere. We describe an investigation of a large number of F. tularensis isolates from humans. Patients were infected mainly from mosquito bites and had an in ﬂ uenza-like illness, a primary skin ulcer, and enlargement of lymph nodes, the ulceroglandular form of tularemia ( 5,6). Tularemia is endemic in Sweden, with seasonal outbreaks and a patchy geographic distribution. The number of infected humans ranged from 27 to 698 per year from 1998 through 2007 in a population of ≈9.1 mil- lion (annual incidence rate 0.30–7.78/100,000 persons) ( 7). For comparison, 20–64 humans were reported with tula-remia from 2000 through 2006 in the tularemia-endemic US states of Arkansas and Missouri, from a population of ≈8.3 million (annual incidence rate 0.23–0.76/100,000 per- sons) ( 8). F. tularensis subsp. holarctica causes tularemia all over the Northern Hemisphere. This is a severe febrile disease but does not generally result in death. A more viru-lent variety, F. tularensis subsp. tularensis , exists in North America. It was associated with a human mortality rate of 5%–15% before the advent of effective antimicrobial drug Landscape Epidemiology of Tularemia Outbreaks in Sweden Kerstin Svensson, Erik Bäck, Henrik Eliasson, Lennart Berglund, Malin Granberg, Linda Karlsson, Pär Larsson, Mats Forsman, and Anders Johansson Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1937 Author af ﬁ liations: Swedish Defense Research Agency, Umeå, Sweden (K.

RESEARCH treatments ( 4). F. tularensis has a clonal genetic structure, a property that should facilitate tracking the spread of tula-remia by genotyping ( 9,10). We demonstrate a strategy to enhance epidemiologic investigations of tularemia by combining geographic data collected from patient interviews and high-resolution geno-typing of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates recovered from tularemia patients. We found that geographic distri-butions of speci ﬁ c F. tularensis subsp. holarctica subpopu- lations were highly localized during outbreaks (infections by some genotypes were restricted to areas as small as 2 km 2), indicating distinct point sources of infection. Materials and Methods Study Locations We studied tularemia, which must be reported under Swedish law, in 2 locations 364 km apart: the Municipality of Ljusdal and the County of Örebro (19,384 and 273,956 inhabitants, respectively, in 2005) ( 11) (Figure 1). The hu- man tularemia incidence rates in Ljusdal and Örebro cited here were based on the annual number of human tularemia cases reported to the County Medical Of ﬁ cer for Commu- nicable Diseases. Tularemia has been endemic for several decades in Ljusdal with repeated outbreaks ( 12), whereas in Örebro, incidence of tularemia has been low since the disease was ﬁ rst reported in Sweden in the 1930s ( 5). From 1990 through 1999, Örebro reported only 8 cases. Study Period, Isolate Information, and Preparation of DNA From 1995 through 2005, clinicians in Ljusdal and Öre- bro sent patient specimens for tularemia serologic analysis, F. tularensis culture, and PCR detection to the laboratories at the Swedish Defense Research Agency, Umeå, Sweden; Umeå University Hospital, Umeå; or Örebro University Hospital, Örebro. Culture and PCR diagnostics of ulcer specimens were performed as described elsewhere ( 13). Blood culture was performed by using the instrumented BD Bactec Plus system (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). All Francisella culture work was performed un- der BioSafety level 3 laboratory conditions. A tube agglu-tination test or an ELISA measuring immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG was used for serologic analysis, as previously described ( 14). For DNA preparation, F. tularensis isolates were recultured, then a loopful of bacteria was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and heat-killed, and a chaotro-pic salt method was applied ( 6). Identi ﬁ cation and Selection of Markers We used 3 types of genetic markers to provide high- typing resolution and robust categorization of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica into genetic subpopulations. As described elsewhere, we previously identi ﬁ ed 280 insertion/deletion (INDEL) and variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) markers by multiple alignments of the Francisella ge- nomes U112, FSC147, SCHU S4, OSU18, and LVS ( 15). For the current study, we selected 20 of these 280 markers (17 INDELs and 3 VNTRs) that were polymorphic among F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates from Europe and North America. We then added 11 VNTR markers showing polymorphism among subsp. holarctica isolates of world- wide origin, and 1 INDEL (Ft-M19) shown to be speci ﬁ c to subsp. holarctica (9). Finally, we added 2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers identi ﬁ ed in a comparative BLAST analysis (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica genomes of a worldwide origin including FSC200 (human, Ljusdal, 1998), LVS, RC530, FSC022, FTA, OR96-0246, and OSU18. The 2 SNP markers were selected to be phylogenetically informa-tive while lacking homoplasy among 67 Francisella strains of diverse origin. Collectively, the selection process yield-ed a set of 34 genetic markers that were applied to 48 of the 136 study isolates (24 each from Örebro and Ljusdal). Markers found to be polymorphic among the 48 selected isolates were ﬁ nally used to genotype all 136 isolates. 1938 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 Figure 1.

Tularemia Outbreaks in Sweden DNA Fragment Analysis and Real-time PCR SNP Assay DNA fragment analysis of INDELs and VNTRs were performed on a Genetic Analysis System CEQ 8800 (Beck-man Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA) machine, as previ-ously described ( 15). Genomic positions for SNPs and their corresponding PCR ampli ﬁ cation primers are presented in Table 1. The SNP states were determined by real-time PCR by using a set of 2 forward primers with different single nucleotide extensions at the 3 ′ end, and a common reverse primer ( 16). We could read the SNP state by a differential PCR ampli ﬁ cation ef ﬁ ciency. Genetic Groups, Subgroups, and Cluster Analysis We assigned isolates to genotypes by using the binary character output for each INDEL marker, the repeat copy number at each VNTR marker, and the results of the SNP assay. We analyzed the associations among genotypes by their degree of genetic character sharing by using the eBURST algorithm ( 17). Genetic groups were de ﬁ ned as genotypes sharing 16 of 18 characters and subgroups shar-ing 17 of 18 characters. In addition, the genetic associations between the isolates were assessed by cluster analysis by using the unweighted pair group m with arithmetic mean (18) algorithm implemented in BioNumerics version 5.1 (Applied Maths NV, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) using the categorical coef ﬁ cient. Patient Interviews and Geographic Mapping To obtain geographic data on likely places of disease transmission in Ljusdal, all patients in whom F. tularen- sis subsp. holarctica was diagnosed from 1995 through 2005 completed a questionnaire distributed during 2007 and marked on an accompanying map the location of the site where they believed they had been infected. In Öre-bro, patients admitted to hospital with tularemia from 2000 through 2004 were interviewed on admission, interviewed by telephone, or issued questionnaires, as previously de-scribed ( 5). All patients were asked for alternative places of disease transmission and to self-estimate the spatial data quality on a 3-category scale. A pair of RT-90 cartographic coordinates ( 19) was then assigned to each patient and the corresponding F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolate, speci- fying the locations of ﬁ rst-choice place of transmission with the highest self-estimated quality. RT 90 is a standardized 2-dimensional Swedish map reference coordinate system. For patients who indicated multiple places of infection with identical data quality estimates, the coordinates of the place closest to the spatial mean center of tularemia in Ljusdal or Örebro were used (online Appendix Table 1, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1937-appT1.htm, and online Appendix Table 2, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1937-appT2.htm). If no geographic information was available for a patient, the residential ad-dress was used. We visualized and analyzed geographic and genotype data by using ArcView software in ArcGIS version 9.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA), and calculated spatial mean centers of disease occurrence (the average x and y values for the input coordinates) for all genetic groups and subgroups of isolates. The directional trend was examined by using the directional distribution tool in ArcGIS Spatial Statistics Tools (ESRI) and an ellipse size of 1 standard deviation. Results Descriptive Epidemiology We isolated F. tularensis from 136 of 441 patients with laboratory-veri ﬁ ed tularemia in the Municipality of Ljusdal during 1995–2005 (n = 56) and in the County of Örebro during 2000–2004 (n = 80). This ﬁ nding constituted 34% (56/163) and 29% (80/278) of all patients with laborato-ry-veri ﬁ ed tularemia during the outbreak years in Ljusdal (1995, 1998, 2002, 2005) and Örebro (2000, 2002–2004), respectively (Figure 1).

RESEARCH to the total number of tularemia patients. The ages of pa- tients from whom positive cultures were obtained ranged from 1 to 90 years, distributed evenly among age groups: 20%, 18%, 34%, and 28% in persons 0–20, 21–40, 41–60, and >60 years of age, respectively, with a male:female ra-tio of 1.2:1 (online Appendix Tables 1, 2). No apparent correlations were found between genotypes and either the gender or age of the patients. The annual incidence rates of tularemia were 21–423 per 100,000 persons in the Mu-nicipality of Ljusdal and 12–55 per 100,000 persons in the County of Örebro in outbreak years, but disease-free years were interspersed between outbreaks. Generally, tularemia patients reported that they were infected at places used for outdoor activities, e.g., on walking paths, at bathing places, at golf courses, or in an allotment garden (parcels of land for cultivation) assigned to individuals or families (Figures 2–4; online Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1937-Techapp.pdf). A statement of a likely arthropod transmission vector was available for pa-tients from Örebro; indicating mosquitoes (n = 101), ticks (4), horse ﬂ ies ( 8), mosquitoes or ticks ( 2), mosquitoes or horse ﬂ ies ( 19); 144 patients reported not knowing (the vec- tors reported by the 80 patients with culture-veri ﬁ ed tula- remia are listed in online Appendix Table 2). A presumed place of tularemia acquisition was pinpointed by 120 (88%) of 136 of patients and self-estimates of the quality of spatial data were available for 44 of 56 patients in Ljusdal and 76 of 80 patients in Örebro (online Appendix Tables 1, 2) with culture-veri ﬁ ed tularemia. Overall, patients felt con ﬁ dent about where they had acquired tularemia; 92 of 136 patients indicated that their place of disease acquisition was certain or probable (Table 2). Genetic Analysis of Outbreak Isolates We ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed 34 genetic markers that were poly- morphic among F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates of worldwide origin. Among these, 18 markers (6/14 VNTRs, 10/18 INDELs, and both SNPs) were polymorphic among the 136 study isolates. Seven of these polymorphic markers have not been previously described (Table 1); 11 (Ftind30–34, Ftind37, Ft-M3, Ft-M6, Ft-M20, Ft-M22, Ft-M24) have been previously published ( 9,15). By applying the 18- marker system to the 136 isolates, we identi ﬁ ed 19 geno- types. The 136 isolates were assigned to 3 genetic groups (denoted 1, 2, and 3) corresponding to previously described genetic groups ( 9,15,20 ) and 5 subgroups (denoted 1a–e), on the basis of their degree of character sharing (Figure 5). Most isolates from Ljusdal (55/56) and Örebro (68/80) be-longed to genetic group 1. In pairwise comparisons, genetic groups 1, 2, and 3 differed at 6–13 of the 18 characters. A mutation at marker Ft-SNP2 was distinctive to the large ge-netic subgroup 1e from Ljusdal (53 isolates). Cluster analy-sis based on a distance matrix showed an identical grouping of isolates (Figure 5). Only 1 genotype was represented in both study locations; an isolate from Ljusdal obtained in 2005 was identical to an isolate from Örebro in 2003 (see genotype ID 9; Figure 5). In both study locations, genetic subgroups and genotypes were present throughout a tulare-mia season and persisted over years (Figures 5, 6). Phylogeographic Analysis in Ljusdal The F. tularensis isolates recovered from 1995 through 2005 from patients in Ljusdal were genetically monomor-phic.

Tularemia Outbreaks in Sweden group 1e were circumscribed by a 150-km2 ellipse (Figure 7, panel A). All 56 isolates were circumscribed by a 230-km 2 ellipse. Analysis per outbreak year showed that the infection area of 1e isolates was stable, with an east–west distribution along the river Ljusnan (Figure 7). The places of disease transmission for 3 isolates of genetic subgroups 1b, 1c, and 3 were peripheral to the infection area of 1e iso-lates (Figure 7, panel D). Many patients reported acquiring tularemia from restricted geographic areas, e.g., 33 of 56 isolates were from a 25-km 2 stretch along the river Ljusnan, with a disease cluster at a golf course (Figure 2). Phylogeographic Analysis in Örebro In Örebro, the places of disease transmission for ge- netic groups 1 and 2 were within 2 partially overlapping geographic areas with distinctly separate mean centers of occurrence (Figure 8, panel A). Closer examination of the areas of genetic group 1 showed that those of subgroups 1a, 1b, and 1d had similar spatial centers but different direc-tional distributions (Figure 8, panels B–D). Infection loca-tions of genetic subgroups 1a and 1b were oriented in an east-west direction along the Svartån River, whereas those of subgroup 1d were oriented in a north-south direction along the Lillån River. The places of disease transmission of genetic group 1 were circumscribed by a concatenated 272-km 2 ellipse area (Figure 8, panel A); those of genetic group 2 were circumscribed by a 645-km2 ellipse (Figure 8, panel E). The proportions of isolates transmitted within the elliptic infection areas of genetic subgroups 1a, 1b, 1d, and 2 were 7 of 12, 9 of 16, 30 of 37, and 7 of 12, respec-tively (Figure 8, panels B–E). The geographic distribution of genetic subgroup 1a’s places of transmission was most restricted, spanning an elliptic area of only 16 km Seven of 12 transmission locations of genetic subgroup 1a could alternatively be enclosed in a rectangular area of just 2 km 2 (Figure 8, panel B). The genetic subgroup 1c comprised only 3 isolates with 3 distinct genotypes; places of disease transmission spanned a distance of 58 km (not shown). In total, 240 of 278 patients in Örebro reported places of tularemia transmission. A spatial distribution plot of the locations reported by 202 of these patients is shown in Fig-ure 3 (those of 38 patients are not shown because they were outside the map area), indicating the existence of 4 tulare-mia transmission clusters. Two clusters are further detailed in Figure 4. Eighty-three patients reportedly acquired tula-remia in the Oset/Rynningeviken nature reserve 2 km from Örebro City center. Twenty-six of 27 cultured F. tularensis isolates from this area belonged to genetic group 1. Seven-teen patients reported transmission at Lake Lången, 5 km north of Örebro City. Here, multiple patient reports veri ﬁ ed that bacteria of genetic groups 1d and 2 coexisted. How-ever, the centers of occurrence were geographically distinct (Figure 8, panel A).

RESEARCH junction with information obtained from patient surveys and interviews to investigate the epidemiology and geo-graphic spread of disease. Places of transmission of spe-ciﬁ c F. tularensis genotypes (Figure 5) were highly local- ized and restricted to areas as low as 2 km 2, pinpointing likely point sources of infection (Figures 7, 8). The results demonstrate the capability of enhancing epidemiologic in-vestigations of tularemia by combining data from patient interviews with high-resolution genotyping of F. tularensis isolates recovered from the same patients. A recent study in Utah of 5 patients and 11 rabbit car- casses infected with F. tularensis indicated that multiple F. tularensis subspecies and genetic subgroups may cause tularemia in a localized outbreak ( 21). Other studies have demonstrated that genetic subgroups of F. tularensis have distinct frequencies at continental scales throughout the Northern Hemisphere ( 20,22–24 ). Our study, in which 136 F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates from 2 localized hu- man outbreaks were examined, shows the phylogeographic structure in F. tularensis subsp. holarctica populations in- volved in local outbreaks. Why is there a phylogeographic structure? We found high genetic diversity and limited spatial distribution of ge-netic group 1 isolates in Örebro, which suggested recent expansion of local F. tularensis subsp. holarctica popu- lations. The number of genotypes in genetic group 1 was notably greater than among genetic group 2 isolates from Örebro or among all the isolates recovered in the long-term tularemia-endemic area of Ljusdal (Figure 5). Because pre-vious genotyping data have demonstrated that homoplastic SNP mutations are virtually nonexistent in F. tularensis (20,25 ), a common mutation at Ft-SNP1 (Figure 5) indi- cates that the isolates in genetic subgroup 1d in Örebro and 1e in Ljusdal share a more recent common ancestor than they do with isolates of subgroups 1a, 1b, or 1c in Örebro. However, genetic distances among all the group 1 isolates are likely to be small because Ft-SNP1 could be identi-ﬁ ed only by comparison of complete genome sequences, including a genetic subgroup 1e genome (strain FSC200 from Ljusdal) ( 26,27 ). Altogether, the data imply that ge- netic groups 1a, 1b, and 1c isolates have a local evolution-ary history rather than a recent local disease introduction (as veri ﬁ ed by high genetic variation at VNTR markers) and that the 1d isolates appear genetically related with iso-lates from Ljusdal (as veri ﬁ ed by a SNP mutation). Restoration of a wetland area between 1993 and 2006 (Figure 4) in Örebro may have been a factor in expansion of these genetic subgroups. Because F. tularensis subsp. holarctica is known to be associated with natural waters, favorable conditions for its replication may have resulted. The large genetic distance between genetic groups 1 and 2 in Örebro (they are consistently distinct at 9 of 18 markers; Figure 5), where tularemia recently has reemerged, com-pares with distances previously found among F. tularen- sis subsp. holarctica isolates of worldwide origin ( 9) and excludes a recent local common origin.

Tularemia Outbreaks in Sweden several distinct F. tularensis populations active within a single tularemia outbreak is further demonstrated by com-paring data of this study with data from previous work by Johansson et al. ( 9) and Kugeler et al. ( 24). All of the group 1 isolates belong to clades named B1/B3 or B.Br.013/014, respectively in these previous publications; group 2 isolates belong to clade B4 or B.Br.007/008 (or a nearby clade), and group 3 isolates to clade B2 or B.Br.OSU18. Kugeler et al. demonstrated the large numbers of SNPs separating group 1 from groups 2 and 3 isolates, thus verifying very distinct genetic populations. The geographically widely distributed genetic group 2 in Örebro, the subgroup 1d in Örebro, or the subgroup 1e in Ljusdal, may be results of past temporary reductions of population sizes (genetic bottlenecks) or selective events (selective sweeps) that have eliminated genetic variation in originally more diverse populations. The selective sweep hypothesis is particularly attractive; a highly ﬁ t genotype over time will increase its frequency relative to other geno- types and may occupy larger geographic areas. This scenar-io would explain previous ﬁ ndings of low genetic diversity among isolates recovered from areas of Sweden with a long history of tularemia infections ( 9). The genetic differences of genetic groups and sub- groups were mirrored spatially. The genetic groups 1 and 2 in Örebro showed distinct mean centers of occurrence (Fig-ure 8, panel A), and genetic group 1d isolates were the only isolates of group 1 found along the whole stretch of the river Lillån, resulting in a distribution area oriented north-south, opposite to subgroups 1a and 1b, which showed an east-west direction of their distribution areas (Figure 8, panels B–D). Similar pattern of separated disease occur-rence center for genetic groups were found in Ljusdal (Fig-ure 7, panel D). Collectively, these observations indicate distinct replication foci and dispersal areas of different F. tularensis subsp. holarctica populations.

RESEARCH Many reasons are likely for a clustering of human tula- remia. First, tularemia occurrence depends on the number of persons at risk, i.e., those who visit or live in areas where F. tularensis foci exists (Figures 2, 3). Second is the effect of vector ecology. Most of the 134 (91%) patients in Örebro who speci ﬁ ed a disease transmission vector reported it to be mosquitoes. Thus, the distance that mosquitoes disperse, 200–2,000 m for most species in Sweden ( 28,29 ), probably strongly in ﬂ uences the infection patterns. Third, local fac- tors affect the persistence and distribution of F. tularen- sis in nature. We found identical genotypes over different years, indicating that tularemia overwinters at the disease cluster sites. Genetic groups also were present during the whole tularemia season from July to September, indicating that no particular temporal patterns were associated with speciﬁ c bacterial genotypes (Figures 5, 6). Although uneven distributions of persons at risk and transmission vectors, as well as a general association of tularemia with streaming waters, may explain geographic disease clustering in humans, only different spatial distri-butions of F. tularensis populations can explain cluster- ing of genetic groups and subgroups. Our observations are consistent with Pavlovsky’s theory of “natural nidality of transmissible diseases,” i.e., a connection of the vector-borne disease with a de ﬁ nite geographic landscape ( 30). In the case of tularemia, a recent study on dog ticks carry- 1944 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 Figure 7.

Tularemia Outbreaks in Sweden ing F. tularensis subsp. tularensis on Martha’s Vineyard (Massachusetts, USA) showed persistence in a microfocus in nature over 4 years ( 31). Supporting the existence of a landscape epidemiology of tularemia, we found that differ-ent F. tularensis subsp. holarctica populations are locally present near certain bodies of water where they apparently stably perpetuate. A major limitation of this study is a retrospective de- sign that may have caused recall bias regarding the loca-tions at which tularemia was contracted. The patient recall time in Ljusdal sometimes was up to 12 years; in Örebro patients were approached at admission to hospital. It is our impression, however, from many patient interviews, that the short incubation time of tularemia (2–5 days), the dis-tinct clinical expression, its occurrence in restricted geo-graphic areas, and a transmission route by blood-feeding arthropods, did facilitate patient recalls. Ljusdal and Örebro in Sweden have comparatively high tularemia incidence rates. The results of this study suggest that genotyping coupled with global imaging satel- Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1945 Figure 8.

RESEARCH lite mapping can help identify local environmental sourc- es of tularemia, which is essential for effective infection control. This study also shows that pathogen genome se-quencing efforts can contribute to the design of genotyping schemes tailored to a speci ﬁ c outbreak investigation. By combining high-resolution genotyping with patient inter-views, we found F. tularensis populations to have strong spatial associations in 2 localized tularemia outbreaks. In future investigations, we believe that application of parallel mass-sequencing technologies to F. tularensis will be high- ly valuable for identifying additional genetic markers that, in turn, will facilitate tracking of the zoonotic pathogen through environmental sources, blood-feeding arthropods, and mammals. In addition to a more detailed genetic analy-sis, we need to identify ecologic correlates to the local areas of F. tularensis persistence and replication. Ultimately, the goal is to gain knowledge enabling future focused interven-tions directed at reducing the risk for tularemia acquisition by humans visiting or living in areas in which tularemia is highly endemic.

The emerging tick-borne pathogen Anaplasma phago- cytophilum is under increasing scrutiny for the existence of subpopulations that are adapted to different natural cycles. Here, we characterized the diversity of A. phagocytophilum genotypes circulating in a natural system that includes mul-tiple hosts and at least 2 tick species, Ixodes ricinus and the small mammal specialist I. trianguliceps . We encountered numerous genotypes, but only 1 in rodents, with the remain-der limited to deer and host-seeking I. ricinus ticks. The ab- sence of the rodent-associated genotype from host-seeking I. ricinus ticks was notable because we demonstrated that rodents fed a large proportion of the I. ricinus larval popula- tion and that these larvae were abundant when infections caused by the rodent-associated genotype were prevalent. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that genotypically distinct subpopulations of A. phagocytophilum are restricted to coexisting but separate enzootic cycles and suggest that this restriction may result from speci ﬁ c vector compatibility. The tick-transmitted bacterium Anaplasma phagocyto- philum is the causative agent of granulocytic anaplas- mosis, an infection of medical and veterinary importance that is widely encountered across the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere ( 1–3). Although considerable ef- fort has been put into determining the natural diversity of A. phagocytophilum (4–6), our understanding of ecologic and evolutionary processes that underlie this diversity remains far from complete. A. phagocytophilum has been detected in the blood of a wide range of mammals and in several different Ixodes species, which suggests that it is a general- ist parasite with the capacity to exploit multiple hosts and vectors ( 1–3,5–9). However, evidence for the existence of subpopulations that are adapted to speci ﬁ c reservoir host species has recently been forthcoming ( 7,9,10), and these subpopulations appear to possess differing potential to be a public health threat ( 7,9,10). This phenomenon has also been described within another tick-borne generalist species complex, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato ( 11) and, more recently, within the 1 generalist member of this complex, B. burgdorferi sensu strictu ( 12,13). As yet, no evidence has shown that subpopulations of either A. phagocytophi- lum or B. burgdorferi have adapted to different Ixodes spe- cies as vectors. Knowledge of the existence of host- or vector-adapted subpopulations is important given the public health con-sequences of multivector transmission by these pathogens. For example, we and other researchers ( 14–19) have hy- pothesized that pathogen populations maintained in ef-ﬁ cient tick-rodent cycles by nidicolous (nest-living and host-specialist) ticks, such as I. trianguliceps in the Unit- ed Kingdom and I. spinipalpis and I. minor in the United States, could spill over into the human population due to the co-occurrence of sympatric exophilic (and human-bit-ing) tick species such as I. ricinus in the United Kingdom and I. paci ﬁ cus and I. scapularis in the United States. The purpose of this study was to characterize the di- versity of A. phagocytophilum strains circulating in a natu- ral multihost, multivector system and to determine whether the observed diversity had any ecologic basis. We obtained compelling evidence to support the proposition that differ-ent subpopulations of A. phagocytophilum exploit different tick and mammal species and, as a result, occur in discrete enzootic cycles even though both vectors and hosts are sympatric.Delineating Anaplasma phagocytophilum Ecotypes in Coexisting, Discrete Enzootic Cycles Kevin J.

Delineating A. phagocytophilum Ecotypes Materials and Methods Natural Multihost, Multivector Study System Kielder Forest is a managed plantation forest domi- nated by Sitka and Norway spruce that covers 620 km2 in northern England (55°13 ′N, 2°33′W). The harvesting of timber generates clearcut areas of 5–12 ha, which are subsequently replanted and progress through grassland and the thicket stage after 12–15 years. The most abundant mammal species encountered within clearcut areas is the ﬁ eld vole ( Microtus agrestis ), which exhibits multiannual population cycles in which densities can reach >700/ha (20). Roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ) are also abundant at an estimated density of 3 deer/km 2 across the forest and are frequent visitors to clearcut areas ( 21). The presence of I. ricinus and I. trianguliceps ticks in clearcut areas has been documented ( 18,19). Monitoring of Host and Vector Populations Protocols for the handling and sampling of wild rodents were approved by the University of Liverpool Committee on Research Ethics and were conducted in compliance with the terms and conditions of licenses awarded under the UK Government Animals (Scienti ﬁ c Procedures) Act, Voles were trapped at 4-week intervals from March 2004 through November 2005 (excepting December 2004 and February 2005) at 4 principal study sites that were 3.5 km–12 km apart. Each animal captured was processed as described previously and a blood sample was taken from the tail tip ( 19). Voles were examined for ticks, with all larvae being removed and stored in 70% ethanol for iden-tiﬁ cation ( 22,23) before releasing the animal at the point of capture. Nymph and adult ticks were not removed to minimize any effect on the transmission of tick-borne in-fections, which were being studied as part of an extensive longitudinal program. Host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs and adults were collected at monthly intervals from the princi-pal study sites from March 2004 through September 2005 as previously described ( 19) and from 17 additional sites widely distributed across the Kielder Forest District. Col-lected ticks were stored and identi ﬁ ed as described above. Roe deer blood samples were collected from January 2004 through July 2006 from animals culled throughout the for-est and stored in EDTA-containing tubes at –20°C. Host Bloodmeal Source Identi ﬁ cation The relative importance of different species as hosts for I. ricinus larvae was determined as previously described (24). Probes for the following taxa were used: Myodes spp., Apodemus spp., Microtus agrestis , Sciurus spp., Sorex araneus , Meles meles , and C. capreolus, together with a generic bird probe ( 24).Monitoring of A. phagocytophilum Genotypes Crude nucleic acid extracts were prepared from blood samples and host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs as previously described ( 11). The presence of A. phagocytophilum DNA in each extract was assessed by a real-time PCR ( 25). Genotyping of A. phagocytophilum strains exploited sequence variation at 3 genetic loci, 16S rDNA, msp4, and DOV1. Fragments of msp4 and 16SrDNA were ampli ﬁ ed and analyzed as described ( 18,25). DOV1 is a noncoding region of ≈275 bp lying immediately downstream of a pre- viously described variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) locus ( 6). Ampli ﬁ cation of this locus was achieved by using seminested PCR. The ﬁ rst round of ampli ﬁ cation contained 10 ρmol of each of the primers DOV1f (5 ′-GAT CTA TGA ATT GCY RGT GTT ATA-3 ′) and DOV1r1 (5 ′-ACA TTG TCA ATT TCT CAC CAT-3 ′), 12.5 μL of 2× Master Mix (Abgene, Epsom, UK), 1 μL of nucleic acid extract and sterile H 2O to a ﬁ nal volume of 25 μL, which was subjected to a thermal program of 95°C for 3 min, then 35 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 58°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 50 s, then a ﬁ nal extension step of 72°C for 5 min. The second round of ampli ﬁ cation incorporated 1 μL of ﬁ rst-round product into a reaction containing 10 ρmol of each of the primers DOV1f and DOV1r2 (5 ′-CAA YRC ACR YAC ATT TCT AGG A-3 ′), 22.5 μL of Reddymix (ABgene), made up to a ﬁ nal volume of a 25 μL with sterile H 2O. This reaction mix was subjected to the same thermal program as used for the ﬁ rst round of ampli ﬁ cation. DOV1 amplicons were se- quenced directly by using the second round primers. DNA sequences from all 3 loci studied were veri ﬁ ed, assembled and aligned by using Chromas Pro (Technelysium Pty Ltd, Tewantin, Queensland, Australia) and MEGA4 software (26). Sequence similarity calculations and phylogenetic in- ferences were conducted by using MEGA4 software ( 26). Results Monitoring of Host and Vector Populations A total of 2,926 blood samples from 1,503 voles at the 4 study sites was obtained. Similar numbers of voles were encountered at each site and the population size at all sites ﬂ uctuated in a broadly synchronous manner, in keeping with the well-documented seasonal and multian-nual population cycles ( 27). A. phagocytophilum DNA was detected in 183 (6.3%) of the blood samples, representing 157 (10.4%) of individual animals tested. Except for the bacterium being seemingly absent from 1 site in 2004, the seasonal variation in prevalence of infection was similar at all sites, with infections disappearing over winter, before reappearing in the spring and persisting until late autumn (Figure 1, panel A). Of the 3,378 ticks that were recorded on the sur- veyed voles, 83.6% (2,823) were larvae, 13.4% (454) were Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1949

RESEARCH nymphs, and 2.9% (101) adults. Approximately equal numbers of I. ricinus (1,618, 57.3%) and I. trianguliceps (1,205, 42.7%) were identi ﬁ ed among the larvae, the sea- sonal dynamics of which are shown in Figure 1, panel B. I. ricinus larvae were most abundant in late spring/early sum- mer, whereas I. trianguliceps larvae were most abundant in late autumn. The dramatic spike in the number of I. ricinus larvae recorded in May 2005 resulted from a small number of voles at one of our principal study sites having an ex-tremely high number of larvae. Although nymph and adult ticks were not removed from voles (so could not be identi-ﬁ ed to species), their numbers were recorded. Of relevance to this study, virtually no nymphs or adults were observed on voles between November and April (Figure 1, panel B). The absence of the life stages that are capable transmitters of A. phagocytophilum underlies the disappearance of in- fections in voles during winter. Blood samples were collected from 279 roe deer and A. phagocytophilum DNA was detected in 132 (47.3%) of these samples. Infections were detected throughout the year, with infection prevalence consistently high during the late spring/early summer of the years surveyed (Figure 2). In total, 4,984 nymphs, 680 adult males, and 656 adult female host-seeking I. ricinus ticks were collected by drag-ging. The seasonal dynamics of both life stages have been presented elsewhere ( 19). A. phagocytophilum DNA was de- tected in 30 of 4,256 nymphs tested (0.7%), 9 of 263 adult females (3.4%) and 8 of 321 adult males (2.5%). Infected nymphs were encountered at 10 different sites. Infected host-seeking nymphs were collected during the same dragging session on only 8 occasions, suggesting that, for the most part, infected nymphs had fed on different animals. Host Bloodmeal Source Identi ﬁ cation Bloodmeal source identi ﬁ cation was attempted on 399 host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs and unambiguous results were obtained for 105 ticks (26.3%). These ticks were ob-tained from dragging sessions throughout 2004 (87 ticks) and 2005 (18 ticks) from the 4 principal study sites. Sixty-two (59.0%) showed evidence of having fed on voles as larvae, 18 (17.1%) fed on birds, 15 (14.3%) fed on deer, and the remaining 10 (9.5%) fed on small mammal species other than ﬁ eld voles. Monitoring of A. phagocytophilum Genotypes Comparison of partial 16S rDNA sequences ob- tained from 5 infected voles and 5 infected deer showed 4 highly similar (>99%) sequence types. All voles were infected with a sequence type that was identical to one previously associated with various ruminant species (e.g., Old Sourhope, GenBank AY176591). Three 16S rDNA se-quence types were obtained from the deer samples, 2 of which had been previously reported associated with a vari-ety of animals and tick species across the Northern Hemi-sphere (e.g., GenBank AF481850 and AJ242783), but the third sequence type was new. Although comparison of 16S rDNA sequence types was useful in con ﬁ rming that detect- ed DNAs were derived from strains of A. phagocytophilum , the insensitivity of this locus for intraspecies delineation led us to attempt sequence typing on the basis of a more variable locus, msp4 (6,28). 1950 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 Figure 1.

Delineating A. phagocytophilum Ecotypes Unambiguous sequence data were obtained from am- plicons derived from 45 infected roe deer, 48 infected voles, and 21 infected host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs and adults. For each host or vector, the samples came from across the range of sites, seasons and years of study. Seven msp4 se- quence types were obtained from infected roe deer. One sequence type was detected in most (30) samples. This and a second sequence type had previously been encountered among European deer, while the 5 remaining sequence types were new. Four msp4 sequence types were encoun- tered among the infected host-seeking I. ricinus ticks, all of which were also detected in roe deer. The most com-monly encountered sequence type, which infected 17 ticks, was the same as that found most frequently among infected deer. The partial msp4 sequences obtained from 48 infected ﬁ eld voles were all indistinguishable from one another. Phylogenetic analysis, based on an alignment of the 50 A. phagocytophilum msp4 sequence types present in GenBank (as of August 1, 2008), the 6 new alleles re-ported in this study, and homologous sequences avail-able for the closely related species A. marginale and A. centrale , was used to infer the relative evolutionary po- sitions of the A. phagocytophilum strains encountered in this study. The 5 new sequence types obtained from roe deer and host-seeking I. ricinus ticks lay within a cluster of closely related sequence types that also included the 2 other sequence types recovered from roe deer and I. rici- nus ticks that had been previously encountered elsewhere (Figure 3). This well-supported cluster comprised 50 of the 53 A. phagocytophilum msp4 sequence types report- ed to date and was characterized by short intersequence type evolutionary distances and included strains associ-ated with wild and domesticated ruminants, companion animals, and humans. Three A. phagocytophilum sequence types lay outside this cluster (Figure 3) and included types speci ﬁ cally asso- ciated with voles in this study, one associated with Chinese rodents (ZJ-China) ( 8), and one obtained from an infected roe deer in Germany (“roe deer”) ( 5). The evolutionary distances between these 3 sequence types were markedly longer than those between the sequence types within the large cluster, and although maximum parsimony analysis indicated a shared line of descent for the vole-associated and roe deer–associated sequence types, this branching order was not strongly supported when distance matrix– or minimum evolution–based methods of inference were used, and no approach suggested a clustering of either of these sequence types with ZJ-China. Examination of DOV1 sequences supported the msp4 - based analysis. Unambiguous DOV1 sequences were ob-tained from DNA extracts derived from 8 infected deer, 6 infected ﬁ eld voles, and 14 host-seeking I. ricinus ticks. A total of 13 different DOV1 sequence types were obtained; all infected voles yielded the same sequence type, whereas infected deer yielded 5 different sequence types, and infect-ed host-seeking ticks yielded 9 different sequence types. Two sequence types were associated with both deer- and host-seeking I. ricinus ticks. Phylogenetic analysis inferred that DOV1 sequence types associated with deer and host-seeking I. ricinus ticks were closely related to one another, whereas sequence types associated with voles had mark-edly diverged (Figure 4). This phylogeny is congruent with that derived from msp4 data.

RESEARCH Discussion Although considerable effort has been put into explor- ing the genetic diversity of A. phagocytophilum (4–6), the public and veterinary health value of this endeavor has been limited by the failure to identify an ecologic basis for the genotypic variation encountered. Recent studies in the United States have begun to resolve this problem, with the identi ﬁ cation of apparent host-preference ecotypes among different 16S rDNA sequence types of A. phagocytophi- lum (7,9,10). One particular sequence type, referred to as Ap-variant 1, appears to exploit only white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ) as a reservoir host, whereas other variants, including that associated with human granulocytic anaplasmosis (Ap-ha), exploit white-footed mice ( Pero- myscus leucopus ), a species that has long been implicated as a important reservoir for A. phagocytophilum in North America ( 29). In Europe, the epidemiology of A. phago- cytophilum infections appears to be quite different from that in the United States. Although far fewer human cases have been reported, infections in livestock are common and represent a large ﬁ nancial burden to the industry ( 30). Surveys of strains infecting European livestock and wild-living ungulates have found numerous 16S rDNA sequence types, including Ap-ha and Ap-variant 1 ( 6,31), indicating that this locus is not a marker of the same A. phagocyto- philum ecotypes present in the USA. In this study we have begun to unravel the ecologic signi ﬁ cance of the genetic diversity present among European A. phagocytophilum strains by genotyping strains circulating in a natural multi-host, multi-vector system and correlating the genotypes we encountered with the provenance of the characterized strains. Our efforts have resulted in the discovery that ﬁ eld voles serve as a reservoir host for a unique genotype of the species that has markedly diverged from those genotypes encountered in wild roe deer and host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs and adults. This discovery is incompatible with the hypothesis that voles, I. ricinus ticks, and roe deer are all part of the same enzootic cycle but instead provides com-pelling evidence for at least two co-existing yet distinct en-zootic cycles, one involving roe deer as hosts and I. ricinus ticks as vectors and another with ﬁ eld voles as hosts. As we have previously reported, A. phagocytophilum can be maintained in the absence of I. ricinus ticks in a natural cycle involving small mammals and I. trianguliceps ticks (32), and that, even when present in abundance, I. ricinus ticks do not play a major role in this cycle ( 19). I. triangu- liceps ticks, which occur abundantly in our study system, are almost certainly a component of the enzootic cycle that includes ﬁ eld voles. The results of our study are not compatible with the hypothesis that pathogen populations maintained in an en-zootic rodent–nidicolous tick cycle could spill over into humans or livestock because of the co-occurrence of sym-patric exophilic tick species ( 14 –19). Through the use of host bloodmeal source identi ﬁ cation, we demonstrated that I. ricinus larvae had ample opportunity to acquire A. phago- cytophilum infection from voles (over half the questing I. ricinus nymphs we tested fed on voles as larvae). However, we found no evidence of the vole-associated genotype in host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs. This result suggests that, I. ricinus larvae are, at best, inef ﬁ cient vectors of the vole- associated A. phagocytophilum genotype, thereby osten- sibly removing the potential “bridge” out of the enzootic cycle that includes voles and I. trianguliceps . Notably, we did not detect deer/ I. ricinus tick–associated A. phagocyto- philum genotypes in voles despite previously observing I. ricinus nymphs feeding on these hosts ( 25). Because we did not remove nymph or adult ticks infesting our surveyed ro-dents in this study, we were unable to distinguish between I. ricinus and I. trianguliceps ticks, so were unable to gauge the frequency with which the former were encountered, al-though we believe that most nymphs on ﬁ eld voles are I. tri- anguliceps (18). Thus, this absence may result either from voles not being susceptible to deer/ I. ricinus –associated genotypes or simply because encounters between infected I. ricinus nymphs and voles occur only rarely. Although vector specialization by arthropod-transmit- ted pathogens is common ( 33), many of those that are tick- transmitted exploit more than 1 species ( 15–19).Also, clear evidence exists for local adaptation, whereby pathogens exhibit greater infectivity in local vector populations than those that are geographically distinct ( 34,35), although this phenomenon was not encountered for A. phagocytophilum 1952 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Roe deer 9903 Questing I. ricinus nymph 1330156 Questing I. ricinus Ƃ1330021 Questing I. ricinus ƃKRB006 Questing I. ricnus Ƃ1330212 Questing I. ricinus nymph BBH0754 Roe deer 3420 Roe deer 0040 Roe deer 9943 Questing I. ricinus ƃSGS0082 Questing I. ricinus nymph BLB9742 Roe deer 0010 Roe deer 0035 Roe deer 9946 Roe deer 9954 Questing I. ricinus nymph WBN0271 Questing I. ricinus nymph 1330051 Questing I. ricinus ƃBLB-0262 Questing I. ricinus nymph 599-009 Questing I. ricinus nymph 133-0173 Questing I. ricinus ƂBLB-0068 Questing I. ricinus ƃQRY-0040 Field vole 2168 Field vole 2667 Field vole 2082 Field vole 2257 Field vole 2528 Field vole 2781100949353878980 7492 55 78 01 Figure 4.

Delineating A. phagocytophilum Ecotypes (36). We report evidence for the adaptation of different genotypes of the same pathogen species to transmission by different but co-existing vector species. We are planning laboratory transmission studies to determine the extent to which this adaptation represents complete specialization of genotype to vector. Nonetheless, the data we have al-ready obtained from our ﬁ eld studies provide a clear insight into the ecologic consequences of this adaptation; in other words, of what is, rather than what may be, happening. A. phagocytophilum has a wide geographic distribution, and numerous members of the Ixodes genus have been impli- cated in its transmission. Thus, plenty of scope remains for further exploration of vector speci ﬁ city by subpopulations of the pathogen. The transmission of A. phagocytophilum in the laboratory has been reported ( 29) and, subsequently, efforts have been made to examine interstrain variation in the dynamics of this process ( 37). These include a demon- stration that strains from the western United States that are naturally transmitted by I. paci ﬁ cus ticks can be transmitted by I. scapularis ticks in the laboratory ( 35), which suggests that not all A. phagocytophilum strains have adapted to ex- ploit only a single vector species. In addition, I. scapularis serves as a vector for both Ap-ha and Ap-variant 1, the 2 A. phagocytophilum genotypes that possess different host speciﬁ cities ( 7,9,10). These observations, taken together with those made in the current study, provoke the conclu-sion that although the species as a whole can be considered a generalist, A. phagocytophilum embraces a consortium of distinct ecotypes that have evolved a range of strategies to facilitate their own perpetuation. Whether host or vector specialization is the more commonly adopted strategy re-mains to be explored. From an infection control perspective, it is important to recognize that cryptic transmission cycles of tick-borne pathogens maintained by nidicolous ticks have substantial human and veterinary health risk implications when sym-patric exophilic tick vectors act as a bridge to potentiate human or livestock infections. However, our study shows the value of a more profound understanding of the diver-sity of the transmission cycles and pathogens on which to base estimation of the environmental health hazard: discrete co-existing transmission cycles can be associated with dilution of the abundance of tick-borne pathogens when, at ﬁ rst sight, an augmentation would be the expect- ed outcome.

We report a disease outbreak in a Michigan rabbitry of a rabbit calicivirus distinct from the foreign animal dis-ease agent, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV). The novel virus has been designated Michigan rabbit calicivirus (MRCV). Caliciviruses of the Lagovirus genus other than RHDV have not been described in US rabbit populations. The case-fatality rate was 32.5% (65/200). Clinical signs in-cluded hemorrhage and sudden death, with hepatic necro-sis. Analysis of viral RNA sequence from >95% of the viral genome showed an average similarity of 79% with RHDV. Similarity of the predicted MRCV capsid amino acid se-quence ranged from 89.8% to 91.3%, much lower than the 98% amino acid similarity between RHDV strains. Experi-mentally infected rabbits lacked clinical disease, but MRCV was detected in tissues by PCR. We propose that MRCV primarily causes subclinical infection but may induce overt RHD-like disease under certain ﬁ eld conditions. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is caused by a cali- civirus and is associated with illness and death in up to 90%–100% of susceptible rabbit populations ( 1–3). Domestic rabbits ( Oryctolagus cuniculi ) and free-ranging European rabbits ( O. cunicuusi ) are highly susceptible; cottontail rabbits ( Sylvilagus ﬂ oridanus ) and hares ( Le- pus spp.) are unaffected. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease vi- rus (RHDV) was ﬁ rst detected in China in 1984 ( 4) and subsequently has been described in eastern and western Europe, Asia, South America, Australia, Mexico, and the United Kingdom ( 2,3). In the United States, it is considered a foreign animal disease, and outbreaks are of considerable economic concern to the US rabbit industry. In the Unit-ed States 4 outbreaks of RHD have occurred in domestic, captive rabbits ( O. cuniculi ) since 2000. These cases were conﬁ rmed by inoculation study and reverse transcription– PCR (RT-PCR) because the virus is not cultivable in vitro. Subsequent genomic analyses suggested that these inci-dences resulted from separate viral introductions; however, conﬁ rmed points of origin (e.g., imported animal or animal product) were never identi ﬁ ed (3). RHDV is classi ﬁ ed as a Lagovirus within the family Caliciviridae . Caliciviridae are nonenveloped, positive- sense, single-strand RNA viruses. Within this family are 4 genera: Lagovirus, Vesivirus, Norovirus , and Sapovirus (5). In addition to the highly pathogenic RHDV, the La- govirus genus includes several distinct but related viruses affecting rabbits or hares. These are European Brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV), which causes disease similar to RHDV in hares only ( Lepus spp.) ( 6), and the nonpatho- genic rabbit calicivirus (RCV), which causes asymptomatic seroconversion in rabbits ( 7). RCV and EBHSV have not been reported and lagoviruses other than RHDV have not been described in US rabbit populations, although a low pathogenicity rabbit Vesivirus recently was identi ﬁ ed in domestic rabbits from Oregon ( 8). RHDV affects only rab- bits of the Oryctolagus genus which, in the United States, is limited to domestic rabbit species. Wild rabbit species in the United States are not experimentally susceptible ( 9). Seroprevalence surveys of RHDV or related caliciviruses in US domestic rabbit populations have not, to our knowl-edge, been published. Beginning January 1, 2001, and continuing over a 3-week period, a privately owned New Zealand White ( O. cuniculi ) rabbitry in Michigan experienced acute fatalities.

RESEARCH Before this episode, the farm had operated for 1.5 years without notable disease. Approximately 200 rabbits were kept in a closed barn on a 60-acre farm; new rabbits had not been acquired in 18 months. Inappetence in several animals and vulvar hemorrhage in pregnant does were ini-tially noted. A total of 65 rabbits—consisting of 23 adult does (most pregnant), 2 adult bucks, and 41 young rabbits of both sexes—died over ≈3 weeks, for a case-fatality rate of 32.5%. Clinical signs consisted of vulvar hemorrhage in the does, epistaxis, ataxia, opisthotonos, diarrhea, ocular discharge, vocalization, and death. Materials and Methods Biological Samples Three pregnant does (2 live) with vulvar hemorrhage were submitted for diagnostic evaluation on January 3. Eighteen additional rabbits of either sex ranging from 2 through 9 months of age were submitted near the end of the disease outbreak on January 17 and February 2. Animals submitted live were humanely euthanized by intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (Fatal-Plus, Vortech, Dearborn, MI, USA) at 1 mL per 10 pounds. Tissue samples from representative organs of all sub- mitted rabbits were immersion ﬁ xed in 10% neutral buff- ered formalin. We processed tissue samples for histopa-thology using standard methods. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on a negatively stained clari ﬁ ed pooled liver homogenate from 2 of the originally submitted does using standard procedures. For immunohistochemistry, liver sections from an af- fected rabbit were deparaf ﬁ nized and rehydrated by routine methods. Antigen retrieval was by proteinase K (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) for 10 min at 37°C. Endogenous per-oxidase was blocked for 15 min with 3% hydrogen perox-ide, and nonspeci ﬁ c immunoglobulin binding was blocked by 10 min incubation with a protein-blocking agent (Dako). Guinea pig anti-RHDV VP60 antibody (dilution 1:1,000) provided by Dr. F. Parra ( 10) was applied for 30 min at room temperature in a Dako autostainer. After incubation with rabbit anti–guinea pig immunoglobulin (Ig) G, detec-tion was by a chain polymer conjugated staining procedure (EnVision, Dako) with visualization by AEC (Dako) and Mayer’s hematoxylin counterstaining. Negative controls were homologous (guinea pig) nonimmune serum applied to rabbit liver sections. In Situ Hybridization In situ hybridization was performed as described ( 11). Brieﬂ y, liver sections from an affected and an experimental rabbit were deparaf ﬁ nized, digested with 0.25% pepsin and prehybridized. Hybridization was for 5 min at 105°C and 60 min at 37°C with a speci ﬁ c 3′-end digoxigenin-labeled oligoprobe (5 ′-GAGAGTCGTCTCGGTAGTACCTG-3 ′, IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) at 5 μL/1 mL using a commer- cial workstation (Fischer Scienti ﬁ c, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Detection was by antidigoxigenin (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica, Indianapolis, IN, USA) conjugated with al-kaline phosphatase (dilution 1:500, Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica) and the substrates NBT/X-Phos (nitro-blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate, Boeh-ringer Mannheim Biochemica). A non-sense probe was ap-plied to liver sections as negative control. Bacterial Cultures Representative tissues from the original 3 does and 14 subsequently submitted rabbits were cultured by using standard microbiologic techniques. Virus isolation was at-tempted by injection of ﬁ ltered (0.45- μm pore size) 10% homogenate of liver (pooled from 2 of the originally sub-mitted does) in Bovarnik’s buffer onto cultures of RK-13, R9ab, or SIRC cells. Nucleic Acid Extraction and PCR Total RNA from pooled liver of 2 initially submit- ted does was extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. A 398-bp region of the VP60 (capsid) gene was initially targeted using RHDV-speci ﬁ c primers ( 12). RT- PCR was performed on total liver RNA using a One-Step RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN) with forward and reverse prim-ers, 5′-GTT ACG ACT GTG CAG GCC TAT GAG TT-3 ′ and 5′-TTG TTG AGC AGT CCA ATT GTC ACT G-3 ′, respectively, at 0.6 μM in a 50- μL reaction. Cycling condi- tions were as follows: cDNA synthesis at 50°C for 30 min; then predenaturation at 95°C for 15 min and 43 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min; and ﬁ nal extension of 72°C for 10 min. Products were visual- ized in prestained agarose gels by a UV transillumination. The entire capsid gene ( ≈1.8 kb) was ampli ﬁ ed by using primers based on USA Iowa 2000 RHDV strain (spanning nucleotide positions 5273–7065, GenBank accession no. AF258618). Forward and reverse primers, 5 ′-CGG TAG TAC CTG ACG ACG AAT TTG-3 ′ and 5′-GCA AGT CCC AGT CCG ATG AAT-3 ′, respectively, were used as above, with the modi ﬁ cation of 35 cycles with 2 min of extension. Further genomic sequencing used primers from conserved RHDV and Michigan rabbit calicivirus (MRCV)–derived sequences (Table) with annealing temperatures 52°C–55°C and extension times 1 min per 1-kb target length. MRCV genomic ends were sequenced using 5 ′ and 3′ RACE Sys- tems for Rapid Ampli ﬁ cation of cDNA Ends (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For 5 ′ RACE, cDNA was synthe- sized with gene-speci ﬁ c primer, GSP1, 5 ′-ACT GTA CTC CCT GGG TGC GAC-3 ′ (MRCV, 2039–2059, minus sense) with puri ﬁ cation and dCTP-tailing with TdT.

Calicivirus in Rabbits, Michigan dC-tailed cDNA was PCR ampli ﬁ ed by using HotStar Taq DNA Polymerase Kit (QIAGEN) in a 50- μL reaction with 5 μL dC-tailed cDNA, 0.5 μM abridged anchor primer, and gene-speci ﬁ c primer (GSP2) 5 ′-CAT CGC CGC TGG TGT TAA ACT-3 ′ (MRCV, 1662–1682, minus sense) at 95°C for 15 min and 35–45 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 2 min 30 sec; with ﬁ nal extension 72°C for 7 min. For 3 ′ RACE, cDNA was synthesized with an oligo-dT-containing adapter primer according to the kit manufacturer’s protocol. PCR was performed with gene-speciﬁ c primer, 5 ′-GTT ACG ACT GTG CAG GCC TAT GAG TT-3 ′ (the same used in the initial RHDV-speci ﬁ c PCR) ( 12) and the kit component abridged universal primer with reaction speci ﬁ cations above. Sequencing and Sequence Analyses RT-PCR amplicons were puri ﬁ ed from 1.4% agarose gels by QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). PCR products were sequenced by the Research Technology Sup-port Facility of Michigan State University by automated DNA sequencing on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Long PCR templates were sequenced by using primer-walking with newly synthesized 5 ′ and 3′ primers derived with OLIGO 6 primer analysis software (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, CO, USA). Similar GenBank sequences were detected by BLAST analysis ( 13). Sequence assembly and analyses, including multiple Clustal W (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw) sequence alignments and construction of phylog-eny trees, were done with Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI, USA).

Inoculation Study Fourteen 16-week-old male and female, speci ﬁ c pathogen–free New Zealand White rabbits (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) were each inoculated intramuscularly, orally, and intranasally with 2 mL total of liver homogenate containing 10 4–105 PCR detectable units of viral RNA per mL, as determined by PCR assay on serial 10-fold dilutions of RNA extracted from the in-oculum. Homogenate was prepared from frozen ( −80ºC) liver from 2 of the originally submitted does. Two control rabbits were in containment housing in the same cage bank but not in direct contact with inoculated rabbits and were not sham inoculated. The rabbits were free of Pasteurella multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Encephalitozoon cu-niculi, Treponema cuniculi, Clostridium piliforme, myxo- matosis virus, RHDV, Toxoplasma spp., and coccidiosis. Animal husbandry was in keeping with the Animal Welfare Act and US Public Health Service policy, and the infec-tion study protocol was approved by the University Animal Care and Use Committee. Rabbits were monitored for clinical changes and were humanely euthanatized by intravenous pentobarbital injec-tion after 2 (n = 2 control rabbits), 4 (n = 2), or 7 (n = 12) days of infection. Complete necropsies were performed and tissue samples harvested for histology, serology, and RT-PCR.

RESEARCH baculovirus-expressing insect cells and immunoperoxidase detection. Results Gross and Histologic Findings The animals submitted for diagnostic evaluation were in good body condition. Several had conjunctival conges-tion (Figure 1) and mild cyanosis of the lips and ear tips before euthanasia. The pregnant does had small amounts of vulvar hemorrhage and cutaneous hyperemia. The gravid uteri in the does had red to purple serosal discoloration with serosanguinous luminal ﬂ uid. Fetuses were in good condition and appeared normal. The livers of all does and 2 of the young adult rabbits were friable and tan and had accentuated lobular pattern (Figure 2). Individual rabbits variably exhibited icterus, opisthotonos, gastric petechiae and ecchymoses (Figure 3), colonic serosal hemorrhage, and multifocal hemorrhage in caudal lung lobes. In the 3 initially submitted does, the major histologic ﬁ nding was multifocal random or periportal hepatocellular necrosis (Figure 4). Additionally, we found mild periportal heterophilic (neutrophilic) and lymphoplasmacytic in ﬂ am- mation. There were also pulmonary and uterine hemor-rhages with ﬁ brin clots in areas of placental implantation. In the 18 subsequently submitted young adult rabbits, pre-dominant histologic ﬁ ndings were moderate expansion of portal tracts with bile duct proliferation, periductal ﬁ brosis, and mild periportal lymphoplasmacytic in ﬂ ammation. Five rabbits had concurrent heterophilic and bronchopneumo-nia, and 1 had suppurative meningitis. Initial Diagnostic Testing Caliciviral-like particles were detected in pooled liv- er homogenate from 2 of the originally affected does by transmission electron microscopy. On request, the US De-partment of Agriculture Foreign Animal Disease Diagnos-tic Laboratory further tested tissue samples. Results from inoculation testing and RT-PCR using standard primers (3) within the RHDV polymerase region at FADDL were not consistent with RHD, and RHDV was ruled out as the cause of the outbreak. Uterine cultures from 1 of the initially submitted does grew >1,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL P. multoci- da. One young adult rabbit with hepatic necrosis and con- current bronchopneumonia grew >1,000 CFU/mL P. mul- tocida from the lung. Two other rabbits had smaller CFU/ mL (<100) P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica from the lung. Three animals grew low CFU/mL Escherichia coli (<100) from the liver. Virus isolation was not successful. Anticoagulants were not detected within liver samples, and no organic toxins were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.Immunohistochemistry and In Situ Hybridization RHDV was immunohistochemically detected within the cytoplasm of approximately 20% of hepatocytes in 1 of the initially submitted does, primarily in the periportal and midzonal areas (Figure 5). MRCV nucleic acid was de-tected by in situ hybridization in scattered hepatocytes and few Kupffer cells (Figure 6). Capsid Ampli ﬁ cation Using primers targeting the RHDV capsid gene (VP60), we detected a 398-bp amplicon by RT-PCR on pooled liver samples from 2 originally submitted does. BLAST analy-sis (13) of a unique 344-bp sequence (excluding primer sequences) showed average 79% similarity to GenBank RHDV capsid sequences. This unique sequence translates into 113 amino acids with 86.8% similarity to the partial capsid protein in a representative strain of RHDV (FRG, GenBank NC_001543). For comparison, RHDV capsid se-quences typically have 98% identity with one another ( 7). 1958 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Figure 1.

Subsequent sequencing was performed on the same pooled liver sample; however, the 398-capsid amplicon was de-tected in liver and spleen samples from 4 additional clini-cally affected rabbits. Capsid and Genomic Sequencing and Analysis Further ampli ﬁ cation of the entire VP60 gene and up- stream and downstream regions generated a genomic se-quence of 7,387 nt, which is similar to the approximately 7.4-kb length of RHDV ( 3). By alignment with other Lago- virus sequences, this included all but 32 bases of the 5 ′ end of the ﬁ rst open reading frame (ORF) of the genome, which could not be sequenced despite multiple attempts. ORF analysis showed a large (2,328 amino acid) ORF-1 and a smaller (113 amino acid) ORF-2 that overlapped ORF-1 by 8 nt (Figure 7). ORF-1 included conserved sequence motifs for nonstructural (helicases, proteases, and polymerases) and structural proteins (VPg and capsid) in the expected order and location for the Lagovirus genus within the Cali- civiridae family ( 5). ORF-2 included conserved sequence motifs for the secondary structural protein VP12. A novel calicivirus related to but distinct from RHDV was tenta-tively identi ﬁ ed. The isolate was termed MRCV, and the genome was further characterized. Multiple Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis Because most phylogenetic comparisons of RHDV strains are based on capsid sequence, a dendrogram was generated on the basis of MRCV capsid amino acid se-quence in comparison with multiple RHDV strains and with the outliers EBSHV and RCV (Figure 8). By this analysis, MRCV appears as an outlier to RHDV strains and is most closely related to the nonpathogenic RCV.

RESEARCH sequence alignments showed 91.7% similarity to RCV and 8%–91.3% similarity to RHDV strains. In comparison, RHDV strains shared 95.0%-99.8% similarity with each other and 91.3%–92.7% with RCV. Because the capsid gene may be subject to recombination and positive selection, re-latedness predicted solely on capsid sequence is prone to error ( 3). Further analysis compared nucleotide similarities of the ORF-1 polypeptide genomic sequence, excluding the capsid gene (Figure 9). RCV is excluded from this compari-son because only capsid sequence is available ( 7). By this analysis, MRCV again appears as an outlier to RHDV, hav-ing 77.9%–78.5% similarity to RHDV sequences, which share similarities of 87.8%–98.1% among themselves. We undertook some additional comparisons of partic- ular genomic regions. The amino acid sequence of MRCV polymerase was only 88.1% homologous to 4 representa-tive RHDV strains, whereas polymerase is typically close to 100% conserved within viral species. Additionally, at the beginning of ORF-2, RHDV strains have 2 initiation codons, and RCV and EBHSV have only 1. MRCV ap-pears to follow the pattern of RCV and EBHSV (Figure 10). These analyses support that MRCV represents a sepa- rate, novel caliciviral species. Inoculation Study We attempted to reproduce clinical signs of disease with an inoculation study. Clinical signs in inoculated rab-bits were limited to decreased activity and inappetence in 2 rabbits on day 4 postinoculation. These rabbits were eu-thanized, and necropsy indicated they lacked gross or his-tologic lesions. The other inoculated rabbits remained free of clinical disease through the end of the study and lacked gross postmortem lesions. Histologically there was rare, in-dividual hepatocellular necrosis. Several tissues, including liver, spleen, stomach, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and (in 3 rabbits) trachea/lung were positive for viral RNA by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization was positive in rare he-patocytes within the liver (data not shown). Depopulation and Necropsy Findings in Remaining Rabbits Further disease in the affected rabbitry was not re- ported after February 2, and disease outbreaks in additional rabbitries served by the same rabbit dealer were not identi-ﬁ ed. For economic reasons, the owner of the premises de- cided to depopulate the remaining rabbits ≈2 months later. Approximately 130 rabbits were submitted for euthanasia. Twenty- ﬁ ve animals had gross changes in their livers, con- sisting of a granular capsular texture, ﬁ rm and collapsed tips of ventral lobes, and ﬁ rm parenchymal nodules up to 2 cm in diameter (data not shown). Representative tissues from 4 animals were evaluated histologically. The liver showed moderate biliary hyperplasia and periductal to bridging portal-to-portal ﬁ brosis. Although these chronic alterations suggest previous liver insult, they are nonspe-ciﬁ c with respect to cause. Serology Initial diagnostic evaluations did not include serology because of a lack of reagents, but expression of the viral capsid within a baculovirus system enabled serologic test-ing by the time of depopulation. Antibody against MRCV was detected in serum harvested from depopulated rab- 1960 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 Figure 8.

Calicivirus in Rabbits, Michigan bits (data not shown) but not in any of the experimentally inoculated rabbits that were euthanized as late as 7 days postinoculation. Discussion In this study, a naturally occurring disease outbreak with clinical signs and pathologic ﬁ ndings suggestive of RHD was ultimately associated with a novel rabbit cali-civirus, designated MRCV. Although other pathogens, principally P. multocida , were identi ﬁ ed in some animals, these were not consistently present, and the disease lesions and presentation were not typical of pasteurellosis. Other hemorrhage-inducing agents, such as anticoagulants or enterohemorrhagic E. coli (14), were not identi ﬁ ed. In the animals submitted toward the end of the outbreak, the his-tologic ﬁ ndings were consistent with a reparative response to a previous liver insult. Similar reparative histologic ﬁ nd- ings have been identi ﬁ ed in rabbits surviving experimental challenge with less virulent strains of RHDV ( 15).On the basis of the percentage of affected animals in the outbreak and the failure to generate clinical disease in inoculated speci ﬁ c pathogen–free (SPF) rabbits, MRCV appears likely to be of low pathogenicity, and clinically ev-ident disease may depend on the health status, age, or indi-vidual susceptibility of the host. RHDV is known to be most pathogenic in rabbits >8 weeks of age, possibly because of age-related differences in the expression of enterocyte receptors targeted by the virus ( 16–19). The symptomatic animals in this report were all >8 weeks of age. Many were pregnant does, and some had concurrent P. multocida infec- tion. Although the inoculated rabbits were also >8 weeks of age, they were nonpregnant, commercially available SPF animals and lacked the apparently endemic P. multocida present in the diagnostic cases. RHDV-associated illness and death in laboratory rabbits can be lower than in ﬁ eld situations unless the animals are immune-primed by other disease agents ( 3,15). Alternately, the failure to reproduce disease may be due to low viable virus dose (dif ﬁ cult to assess for a noncultivable virus) or premature euthanasia of the inoculated rabbits. Although euthanasia by day 7 was consistent with the anticipated timeframe for calici-viral-induced disease, it may not have been suf ﬁ cient if a low viral dose was used and was likely too early to expect seroconversion. The phylogenetic analyses presented here indicate that MRCV is a distinct species from RHDV and the other known lagoviruses, RCV and EBHSV. MRCV is the ﬁ rst lagovirus other than RHDV detected in US rabbits; howev-er, seropositivity to low or nonpathogenic caliciviruses has been demonstrated in rabbit populations in several other countries ( 7,19–21). Additional low pathogenicity strains may exist undetected in US rabbit populations. Samples to consider for RT-PCR detection of rabbit lagoviruses in-clude liver, lung, spleen, and intestine. Although MRCV in this case was detected in liver, other low pathogenicity caliciviruses such as RCV replicate in intestine and may not be detected if liver is the sole sample evaluated ( 7). Infection with low or nonpathogenic lagoviruse s in other countries has been postulated to mediate some protection against RHDV infection, although whether this is true of MRCV infection is unknown ( 20,21). As evidenced by this case study, diagnosticians faced with hemorrhagic disease Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1961 Figure 9.

RESEARCH and sudden death in rabbits should consider the possibil- ity of low pathogenicity lagoviruses once RHDV has been ruled out. The prevalence and effects of low pathogenicity lagoviruses like MRCV within the US rabbit industry and their potential in ﬂ uence on seropositivity and susceptibility to RHDV remain to be determined.

The percentage of the world’s population living in urban areas will increase from 50% in 2008 to 70% (4.9 billion) in 2025. Crowded urban areas in developing and industrial-ized countries are uniquely vulnerable to public health cri-ses and face daunting challenges in surveillance, response, and public communication. The revised International Health Regulations require all countries to have core surveillance and response capacity by 2012. Innovative approaches are needed because traditional local-level strategies may not be easily scalable upward to meet the needs of huge, densely populated cities, especially in developing countries. The responses of Mexico City and New York City to the ini-tial appearance of in ﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus during spring 2009 illustrate some of the new challenges and creative response strategies that will increasingly be needed in cities worldwide. According to United Nations estimates, the percentage of the world’s population living in urban areas will increase from 50% in 2008 to 70% (4.9 billion persons) in 2025. During 2007–2025, the number of cities with popu-lation 1–5 million will increase from 382 to 524, and the number of megacities (>10 million population, comprising the core city, suburbs, and continuously settled commuter areas) will increase from 19 to 27. Of the 27 megacities, 16 will be in Asia, 4 in Latin America, 3 in Africa, 2 in Europe, and 2 in North America. Currently, 1 in 25 persons lives in a megacity; in Latin America, the ratio is 1 in 7. In central Tokyo, the population density is 5,847 persons/km 2 (1). Cities are increasing in developing countries and often have slums that lack basic services ( 2). The accel- erating global trend toward megacities is a new paradigm of human existence and poses profound public health chal-lenges. New approaches for surveillance, preparedness, and response will be needed because current strategies may not be easily scalable upward to address huge, densely popu-lated areas, especially in developing countries. In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) In- ternational Health Regulations (IHR) Coordination Depart-ment, in collaboration with Lyonbiopole (Lyon, France), held a consultation, Cities and Public Health Crises ( 1). Consultants stated that WHO and national guidance does not always adequately address the challenges their cities face, and they could learn much from each other. This ar-ticle summarizes these challenges, illustrated by the initial appearance of in ﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus during spring 2009 in Mexico City, Mexico, and New York (NYC), New York, USA (metropolitan area populations 20 million and 19 million, respectively). These megacities may not be representative of cities in low-income coun-tries, which face more daunting problems. A Tale of 2 Megacities: Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Spring 2009 Mexico City National surveillance detected an atypical increase in inﬂ uenza-like illness (ILI) in mid to late February 2009 and a further increase in early to mid April.

POLICY REVIEW lance in 23 hospitals in Mexico City and identi ﬁ cation of 47 such cases. Patient samples showed nonsubtypeable in ﬂ u- enza A, identi ﬁ ed on April 23 as a novel in ﬂ uenza A virus of subtype H1N1. The Mexico City response was based on early adaptation of a pandemic in ﬂ uenza preparedness plan that had been developed for a virus originating abroad. Af-ter an expert meeting convened by the secretary of health, given the uncertain potential health impact, the president of Mexico invoked emergency powers; on April 24, com-munity mitigation measures were implemented in Mexico City and the neighboring state of Mexico ( 3–7). These measures were announced and coordinated by the federal government, with participation of state authorities. The ob-jective was to decrease transmission; elements included an intensive mass media campaign to inform the population about in ﬂ uenza, promote personal and environmental hy- giene, request that sick persons stay home, and implement social distancing measures. Persons with ILI were encour-aged to seek prompt medical care. Early in the epidemic, the federal government released antiviral drugs from the national strategic reserve and controlled their distribution. Ill persons and their close contacts had access to this medi-cation free of charge. During the spring outbreak, an es-timated 150,000 cases of ILI with 3,312 hospitalizations occurred in metropolitan Mexico City (H. Lopez-Gatell, pers. comm.). Following the Mexican Pandemic Plan, a program of social mobilization was implemented through a multi-faceted mass media saturation campaign featuring visual representations and a previously developed and tested mes-sage icon, Promi , to address Mexico City’s heterogeneous population and literacy rates (Figure 1). The private sec-tor, including pharmacy chains, food stores, and cellular telephone companies, helped deliver health messages. The Mexican telephone company (Telmex) assembled a call center that received >5 million calls. Novel communica-tion strategies included text messaging and mass emails; information from the Ministry of Health was transmit-ted through >140 million text, 60 million printed, and 18 million email messages. Multilingual health information materials also were provided to all international travelers entering and exiting through Mexican ports, and departing travelers underwent thermal screening. Frequent hand washing and cough etiquette were pro- moted, and all government and private facilities open to the public were provided with alcohol gel and other disinfec-tants. Because of limited water availability in some areas or households, alcohol gel was distributed free. A mass media campaign promoting a healthy distance discouraged greet-ing others by hugging or kissing, common practice among Mexicans of all social strata. Military personnel distributed disposable surgical masks in public places; their use was recommended primarily for sick persons, but many healthy persons also wore them daily. Compliance with recommen- dations appeared to be high, although some persons wear-ing masks may have developed a false sense of security that took priority over cough etiquette and hand washing. When commercially available masks became scarce, some persons made their own, and disposal occasionally was problematic, resulting in littering. Over time, recommendations about cough and sneeze etiquette were followed least frequently. All educational facilities were closed beginning April 24 in Mexico City and, soon after, nationwide. Parents were advised to keep children at home; authorities dis-tributed educational materials for home use.

Pandemic In ﬂ uenza as Urban Health Crisis when educational facilities reopened, all schools had been thoroughly cleaned. Parents were requested to keep ill children home; peer pressure among parents to comply was high. Every day, upon arrival at school, children were screened for fever and respiratory symptoms. Ill children were sent home to receive care; return to school required a note from their primary healthcare provider granting medical clearance. In addition to federal measures, on April 27, the mayor of Mexico City suspended dine-in service in all restaurants and similar establishments, allowing only take-out orders. Many restaurants simply remained closed. When affected businesses were allowed to reopen on May 6, social dis-tancing measures (e.g., avoiding crowding) were encour-aged, and hygiene measures were enforced (Figure 2). Grocery stores and supermarkets remained open, with ad-ditional cashiers used to keep lines short. Persons in public places were advised to remain separated by at least 2 m. Large gatherings were cancelled or postponed, and enter-tainment venues, e.g., movie theaters, were closed. Profes-sional sports matches were broadcast, but stadiums were closed to the public. Churches and temples also remained closed, with religious services broadcast over radio and television. When normal services resumed, communion cups and other shared objects were wiped with hand gel after each use. Mass transit operated normally. Masks were provided for drivers and passengers and buses and subway cars were cleaned frequently. Mitigation measures were broadly accepted by the public. Occasional early dis-crepancies between recommendations from of ﬁ cial and academic sources (e.g., regarding mask use) led to a few critical media reports without apparent consequence. Thou-sands of workplaces of all sizes in Mexico City and the rest of the country were closed for several days, taking a huge toll on the economy. The government provided no ﬁ nan- cial compensation to businesses or workers. The economic impact of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in Mexico during the spring is estimated as >$2.3 billion (0.3% of gross do-mestic product) ( 8). Most important among the many lessons learned in Mexico is that preparation paid off. Although requiring ad-aptation, the preexisting pandemic plan and planning pro-cess facilitated intersectoral work, decision making, and rapid development of a public communications campaign. The availability of a national stockpile of antiviral drugs reassured the public. The participation of the secretary of health as the spokesman demonstrated high-level leader-ship. Clear and transparent communication was important because Mexico was entering mid-term elections, and some politicians hypothesized that the outbreak was a farce to distract Mexicans. The outbreak also enabled detection of some weak- nesses in the Mexican health system. In Mexico, health-care is provided by 3 major healthcare systems; thus compilation of epidemiologic information regarding hos-pitalizations was complex. However, after a few days, a system was devised that provided the necessary consoli-dated information. Laboratory capacity was inadequate for the challenges posed by the outbreak. At the onset of the outbreak, the Ministry of Health had no state-level laboratories with capabilities for in ﬂ uenza molecular diag- nostics; all molecular diagnosis was centralized at the Na-tional Epidemiological Reference Laboratory in Mexico City. The Ministry of Health rapidly improved the national laboratory network and Mexico has now 28 laboratories (1 in nearly every state) with PCR molecular diagnostic capabilities. Although having a pandemic plan was use-ful, operationalizaton of the plan was less smooth. For example, procedures existed to close schools, but criteria for reopening them and the ability to reassure parents that reopened schools were safe did not. NYC Emergency preparedness planning in NYC accelerated after the World Trade Center and anthrax attacks of 2001 and in anticipation of an in ﬂ uenza pandemic. Novel syndro- mic surveillance systems monitor visits to hospital emer-gency departments, calls to emergency medical services, pharmacy sales, worker absenteeism, and outpatient clinic visits. For example, information is collected electronically for ≈90% of daily patient visits from 77% of emergency de- partments. Patients’ age, sex, home postal code, and chief complaint, but not names, are transmitted daily to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, where proto-cols identify and follow up signals that suggest increased Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1965 Figure 2.

POLICY REVIEW community illness. During spring 2009, these systems were essential for real-time monitoring of the pandemic in NYC, e.g., documenting large increases in children with ILI seek-ing care at emergency departments) and for tracking its spread throughout the city from 1 school where it apparently was ﬁ rst introduced and ampli ﬁ ed (9). Additional systems collect etiologic information from, for example, virologic studies on samples of outpatients and hospitalized patients with ILI. However, the ﬁ rst indication to the health depart- ment of the outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus came from a school nurse telephoning a report of increased ILI at a single school. Subsequent surveillance and telephone surveys indicated ≈750,000–1 million persons in NYC had ILI during the spring outbreak ( 10). When the ﬁ rst cases were con ﬁ rmed, an extensive pub- lic communication campaign was implemented through Ready New York, a preexisting program of the NYC Of ﬁ ce of Emergency Preparedness ( 11). The program includes outreach to ethnic populations and translation into many languages. The principal messages were 1) wash hands thoroughly and frequently with soap and water; 2) avoid contact with persons who are obviously sick; and 3) if you get sick with any cold or in ﬂ uenza, stay home from work or school, and avoid contact with others as much as possible During the epidemic peak, the mayor and health com- missioner held frequent press conferences in English and Spanish. A NYC government information hotline (311) previously had been established and featured live operators 24/7, with 98% of calls answered within 30 seconds. Dur-ing the spring outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, ≈54,000 calls to 311 about in ﬂ uenza and a smaller health depart- ment hotline were answered. An electronic health alert net-work and conference calls provided messages to healthcare providers. Aside from the public messages, community miti- gation measures focused on selective closure of schools. Household contacts of case-patients were not quarantined, businesses were not closed, and public gatherings were not cancelled unless they involved closed schools. School clo-sures were decided on an individual basis (known as “reac-tive” closures, based on visits for ILI to the school health nurse and on other factors, such as the ability of students to comply with respiratory hygiene) rather than “preemp-tively” (i.e., before cases in the school but with reports of cases in other schools in the subdistrict or district). Approx-imately 50 schools closed, for ≈1 week each. The NYC emergency stockpile of antiviral drugs was not used because normal distribution channels suf ﬁ ced. Occasional reports of spot shortages required rapid inves-tigation and highlighted the need for close communication with private distributors. If the stockpile had been needed, antiviral drugs would have been distributed to community health centers, public clinics, and hospitals. Distribution of vaccine for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in NYC will depend on indications for use, availability, and urgency of administration. Vaccine will be prioritized for high-risk populations ( 12). Mass vaccination campaigns will use 200 point-of-distribution sites developed to meet pos-sible needs for anthrax prophylaxis, e.g., school buildings throughout the city that each could serve ≈40,000 persons. Problems included basing decisions on a pandemic se- verity index because, at the pandemic onset, its case-fatal-ity ratio was uncertain. Despite previous planning, several school dismissal issues had never been entirely resolved, including the objectives of closure in a less severe pandem-ic (i.e., to protect high-risk students, all students, families; to slow community transmission; to allay public fears). The effectiveness of school closure in meeting these objectives was uncertain, as was the extent to which bene ﬁ ts justi ﬁ ed the secondary impact, including interrupting the academic program, parental work loss, and disruption of services provided at school (e.g., free breakfast and lunch to chil-dren from low-income families, therapy for students with special needs). Operational questions included criteria for school dis- missal and reopening and dif ﬁ culties in monitoring ILI and even absenteeism rates among students. Absenteeism data were often unavailable to the health department until mid-afternoon, relatively late to notify parents about closure de-cisions for the next school day. Instructions were not given for children to remain at home, and some may have recon-gregated elsewhere, such as in public libraries, while their parents were at work ( 13). News of school closures in NYC led to questions from parents in suburban jurisdictions about why their schools remained open, even though they had no known cases. Individual school closings showed the interconnectedness between schools, such as when siblings or neighbors attended different ones. The issue of worker or business compensation for lost time from work to care for ill children remains dif ﬁ cult. On the basis of this experi- ence, in the 2009–10 school year, NYC is urging parents to keep sick children home and emphasizing infection control at school but will close a school only as a last resort. Clo-sure decisions will be made on an individual basis, taking into account whether infection control practices could be improved and whether a high percentage of students have high-risk medical conditions ( 10). During spring 2009, emergency departments were overcrowded with the worried ill, despite many announce-ments about indications for persons with ILI to seek medi-cal care. In the fall and winter of 2009 hospitals are pre-pared to open additional nonemergency ILI care sites (e.g., at primary care clinics). A new 1-stop in ﬂ uenza Web portal provides information, as well as locations of clinical sites, and a call center staffed by nurses accessed through the 311 hotline provides guidance to persons with ILI ( 10). 1966 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009

Pandemic In ﬂ uenza as Urban Health Crisis In the city jail, cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 led to screening and control measures. These included isolation and cohorting of ill prisoners, and quarantine of those who had been exposed to them, to limit the spread of infection in the prison and court systems. Health department staf ﬁ ng to meet surge needs posed challenges, including accessing and training staff from other parts of the health department, especially physicians, and the need to ensure staff time off to prevent burnout. Keeping policies and press releases consistent in the face of changing science and policies required constant attention. Internet survey instruments were effectively used to col-lect epidemiologic data, as in the initial high school student outbreak ( 9). Issues for Cities The experiences from the response to the emergence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in Mexico City and NYC highlighted several challenges raised at the WHO consul-tation ( 1). These include response coordination, surveil- lance and monitoring of illness trends, disease contain-ment and mitigation, delivery of countermeasures, and public communication. Response Coordination Multiple government agencies serve large urban areas. Citizens frequently live, work, attend school in, and com-mute through different jurisdictions. Different political par-ties may control national, state or provincial, suburban, and city governments. Fringe groups or gangs may effectively control some areas. Incident or uni ﬁ ed command systems can be useful approaches to crisis coordination ( 14,15 ). In Mexico City and NYC, advance planning, political leader-ship at the highest levels, and collaboration among public health and emergency management agencies were particu-larly important. Coordination with the private sector often is not well established. Businesses can assist, notably by providing health messages and enabling infectious workers to remain home ( 16). Large companies may have contacts with city leaders, but most are small to medium-sized enterprises with which coordination may be dif ﬁ cult. Multinational corporations, common in cities, may be subject to home-country in ﬂ uences. Response coordination with nongov- ernment, community, and faith-based organizations also is important. Outbreaks in cities near international borders require coordination with foreign partners. Surveillance and Monitoring of Illness Trends Emerging challenges in cities include the vertical di- mension (high-rise apartment blocks), travelers, and persons who do not have ﬁ xed addresses or who live in slums. Novel approaches for illness reporting and population surveys may include use of cell phones and the Internet. Illness surveil- lance ultimately depends on the organization and provision of health services; cities with universal health coverage will have important advantages ( 17). Outbreak recognition still often depends on alert clinicians; technology-based systems notwithstanding, a school nurse provided the ﬁ rst indication of the in ﬂ uenza outbreak in NYC. Disease Containment and Mitigation Although not generally a problem in Mexico City or NYC during spring 2009, in a larger outbreak in a lower-income country, home isolation or quarantine may be dif-ﬁ cult or impossible for large urban families living in 1 or 2 rooms. Contact tracing is problematic in cities, given the frequency of anonymous interactions. Innovative use of nonhealth databases and 3-dimensional mapping, includ-ing cell phone records and global positioning technologies, may be helpful but may pose privacy issues. Decisions regarding school dismissal are problematic because effectiveness for disease mitigation is dif ﬁ cult to quantify, and operational aspects often are uncertain, whereas the potential for societal disruption is considerable. Analysis is pending of the different approaches taken by Mexico City and NYC during spring 2009, but both have kept schools open during the fall, because pandemic sever-ity has remained comparable with that in the spring. This approach is consistent with updated guidance from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (18,19 ). Many questions remain about how to implement social distancing and infection control measures in typical city venues, including schools, institutions of higher educa-tion, healthcare institutions, mass transit, workplaces, and marketplaces. These issues are even more dif ﬁ cult in devel- oping countries. Many cities have international airports and may need to assist in health screening of passengers; provide medical care to ill passengers; and accommodate stranded passengers, including those in quarantine. Evacuation of a city poses additional public health challenges ( 17,20 ). Delivery of Countermeasures Rapid delivery of countermeasures, e.g., drugs and vaccines, is dif ﬁ cult even for persons with known, ﬁ xed addresses, but more so for persons in slums, travelers, un-documented persons, and homeless persons, as well as the elderly and homebound. Measures taken in Mexico City and NYC during spring 2009 appear to have been suf ﬁ - cient, but these systems are being tested again during the 2009–10 winter season.

POLICY REVIEW and planning ahead ( 21). The generally successful pub- lic communication campaigns of Mexico City and NYC incorporated these approaches. In addition to traditional mass media and the Internet, they also used cell phones and text messaging, which may offer useful models for developing countries. Cell phone networks may need to prioritize health or emergency messages, improved ro-bustness to permit high traf ﬁ c during emergencies, and re- dundancy in case transmitting towers are destroyed (e.g., in a storm). Text messages can be targeted geographically, e.g., to phones locked on to a particular transmitting tower at the time of the message. This approach could be useful for broadcasting localized alerts and instructions, such as locations of vaccination clinics. Discussion Cities are the norm of global development in the 21st century. As cities become larger and more crowded, tra-ditional guidance for detecting and responding to public health crises requires innovation. Modi ﬁ ed guidance may be helpful, but new strategies, technologies, and metrics also will be needed. Preliminary accounts of response to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 during spring 2009 in 2 world megacities offer grounds for optimism. In each case, advance planning laid the foundation for enhanced surveillance and a generally effective response, made possible by an extensive public communications campaign and effective political leader-ship. On the other hand, challenges emerged that would have been ampli ﬁ ed if the illness had been more severe or the period of societal disruption prolonged. Development of new guidance and approaches requires collaboration among large cities, as well as research and evaluation to identify best practices for cities with different resource levels, particularly for implementing core capacity re-quirements under the revised IHR in a world where most persons now live in urban environments. The IHR require all countries to have core capacity for disease “surveil-lance, reporting, noti ﬁ cation, veri ﬁ cation, response and collaboration activities” by 2012 ( 22,23 ). These require- ments must be implemented in urban environments, but they are based on traditional public health levels (local, intermediate, and national), which are less clearly de ﬁ ned for large urban agglomerations. All national governments have committed themselves to IHR implementation; mu-nicipalities must play a central role but may not be aware of their obligations or able to meet them. Many partners will be important, including businesses, which may not realize their stake in IHR implementation ( 24). Sharing of experience and research is needed to develop strategies and best practices that can be considered by similar cities worldwide.Acknowledgments We thank the many members of the Mexican Ministry of Health, New York City Department of Health and Mental Hy-giene 2009 H1N1 In ﬂ uenza Investigation Team, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pan American Health Orga-nization, and World Health Organization staff for management of and response to the spring pandemic; Carlos Santos-Burgoa and Hugo Lopez-Gatell for providing valuable information and com-ment; and Sophia Desillas, Christian Mathiot, and Daniel Rutz for reviewing the manuscript Dr Bell is a medical epidemiologist working on the pandem- ic (H1N1) 2009 response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

Oseltamivir- Resistant Inﬂ uenza A Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus, Hong Kong, China Honglin Chen, Chung Lam Cheung, Hung Tai, Pengxi Zhao, Jasper F.W. Chan, Vincent C.C. Cheng, Kwok-Hung Chan, and Kwok-Yung Yuen Resistance to oseltamivir was observed in in ﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus isolated from an untreated person in Hong Kong, China. Investigations showed a re-sistant virus with the neuraminidase (NA) 274Y genotype in quasi-species from a nasopharyngeal aspirate. Monitoring for the naturally occurring NA 274Y mutation in this virus is necessary. Emergence of in ﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, presumably from swine to humans, has spread glob- ally since April 2009 ( 1–3). This emergence prompted the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic caused by this virus on June 11, 2009. Although most cases of in-fection are mild or asymptomatic, 1,462 fatal cases were reported to the World Health Organization as of August 6, 2009 (www.who.int/csr/don/2009_09_11/en/index.html). Experimental evidence from animal models showed that this virus was able to replicate to high titers in the lungs of infected animals ( 4), unlike seasonal in ﬂ uenza viruses, which mainly infect the upper respiratory tract. Serologic studies found that antibodies induced by current seasonal inﬂ uenza vaccines show little cross-reactivity to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus ( 5). Therapeutic options are presently limited to 2 neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, because this virus has a swine-origin matrix 2 (M2) gene, which contains a mutation associated with resistance to M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine. Al-though oseltamivir has been widely used in persons infect-ed with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, resistance was not observed until recently. Three unrelated cases of resistance to oseltamivir were observed in Denmark, Japan, and Hong Kong (www.who.int/csr/disease/swine ﬂ u/notes/h1n1_anti viral_resistance_20090708/en/index.html). Emergence of resistance to oseltamivir by seasonal in- ﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) was detected in Norway in 2007. This virus has evolved into the dominant in ﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) in humans ( 6). This ﬁ nding raises strong concerns that the 274Y resistant mutation in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus might circulate and become dominant. We report vi-rologic investigation of the emergence of oseltamivir resis-tance in this virus in a patient from Hong Kong. The Study A 16-year-old previously healthy girl had a fever at the Hong Kong International Airport after her arrival from San Francisco, California, USA, on June 11, 2009. Physical examination showed a temperature of 38.3°C, a blood pres-sure of 117/66 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 94 beats/min, and an oxygen saturation of 99% at room air. Results of a com-plete blood count and liver and renal function tests were normal. She had a leukocyte count of 4.69 × 10 9 cells/L, an absolute neutrophil count of 2.36 × 109 cells/L, and a lym- phocyte count of 1.74 × 109 cells/L. Findings on her chest radiograph were normal. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was positive for inﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) nucleoprotein by immuno ﬂ uo- rescence. NPA specimens on days 1 and 5 were positive for in ﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) M gene and swine-speci ﬁ c speciﬁ c H1 gene by reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR). Samples obtained on days 6–8 were negative. Serum and midstream urine specimens obtained on day 2 were nega-tive for in ﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) M gene by RT-PCR. The patient refused antiviral therapy with oseltamivir because of fear of its potential side effects. She was then of-fered symptomatic treatment. Her clinical condition gradual-ly improved and she was discharged on day 8 uneventfully. Inﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was cultured from NPA. Subsequent drug susceptibility testing showed that this isolate was resistant to oseltamivir (50% inhibitory concentration 197.5 nM), but susceptible to zanamivir, as determined by enzymatic assay (Table). To con ﬁ rm whether the virus contained mutations associated with resistance to NA inhibitors, NA se-quences from the day 1 NPA specimen and an MDCK cell isolate were examined. Viral RNA was extracted from NPA and MDCK cell supernatants by using re-ported procedures ( 7). RT-PCR was performed by using primers spanning position 274 of the NA gene (forward: 5′-ACACAAGAGTCTGAATGTGCATGT-3 ′; reverse: 5′-GTCTCCGAAAATCCCACTGCATAT-3 ′). Direct se- quencing of PCR products was performed by using a Big-Dye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing reaction kit on an ABI PRISM 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).DISPATCHES 1970 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Author af ﬁ liation: The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People’s Republic of China DOI: 10.3201/eid1512.091057

Oseltamivir-Resistant Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus Sequences indicated that the NA genes in the NPA and MDCK cell virus isolates contained an H →Y mutation at the NA 274 (H3 numbering, 275 in H1 numbering) residue (GenBank accession no. GQ351316). No other NA muta-tions known to be associated with oseltamivir resistance were observed. Further examination of sequences showed mixed populations (T/C) in the NA gene from the NPA specimen (Figure, panel A). Estimation of 274H and 274Y populations in the NPA specimen was performed by cloning and sequencing PCR products. The NPA specimen contained approximately equal proportions of 274Y and 274H (52.63% and 47.37%, respectively). Examination of sequences from the MDCK cell isolate showed predominantly the 274Y type, although a minor 274H peak was also observed (Figure, panel B). Cloning and sequencing of PCR products from the MDCK virus isolate showed that 97.92% of the NA genes were 274Y, which suggests that the 274Y population overtook the 274H population during MDCK cell culture. Conclusions Resistance to NA inhibitors among seasonal strains of human in ﬂ uenza viruses (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B) has been rare until recently. Development of resistance after os-eltamivir treatment has occurred in 0.33%–5.5% of treated patients ( 8). Oseltamivir resistance associated with the NA 274Y genotype was also observed in human infections with avian in ﬂ uenza A virus (H5N1) ( 9,10). Low levels of 274Y quasi-species in avian in ﬂ uenza A viruses (H5N1) from avian hosts has been reported ( 11). Oseltamivir-resistant human in ﬂ uenza A viruses (H3N2 and H1N1) have been found to replicate less ef ﬁ ciently than oseltamivir-suscepti- ble strains in cell culture and animal models ( 12–14). How- ever, the NA 274Y resistant mutant in highly pathogenic avian in ﬂ uenza A virus (H5N1) retained the high pathoge- nicity of wild-type virus in mammalian species ( 15). In 2007, an NA H274Y oseltamivir-resistant variant of seasonal in ﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) was detected in Norway (6). This virus has now become the dominant virus popula- tion globally, overtaking oseltamivir-susceptible in ﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1). The molecular basis for the 274Y variant in seasonal in ﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) virus and the mecha- nism by which this resistant variant became the dominant population remain unknown.Lack of general immunity to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in the human population, combined with the inher-ent adamantane resistance of the virus, indicates that NA inhibitors constitute the primary treatment regimen for susceptible patient groups and those in whom severe dis-eases develop during the current pandemic. There is great concern that an oseltamivir-resistant variant of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus may emerge and circulate in a manner similar to oseltamivir-resistant seasonal in ﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1). The patient in this study was not treated with oselta- mivir. Therefore it is unlikely that the 274Y mutation was drug-induced. Detection of mixed populations of 274Y and 274H in the NPA specimen before antiviral treatment sug-gests that the mutation occurs naturally, either before or during infection. Although no experimental data exist that show the growth properties of this resistant variant, exami-nation of the quasi-species population in the cell culture– Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1971 Table.

propagated virus isolate showed that the 274Y variant has become the dominant population. This ﬁ nding implies that the 274Y mutation does not compromise replication of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in vitro. Quarantine procedures adopted by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in China during the early containment phase might have limited transmission of this variant virus. Knowledge of this virus is still limited, and characterization of transmission properties of this resistant variant in in vitro and in vivo models is needed. Moreover, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus should be closely monitored for emergence of resistant variants. Acknowledgments We thank W. Lim and her staff for support.

Outbreak of Antiviral Drug–Resistant Inﬂ uenza A in Long-Term Care Facility, Illinois, USA, 2008 Nila J. Dharan,1 Monica Patton,1 Alicia M. Siston,2 Julie Morita, Enrique Ramirez, Teresa R. Wallis, Varough Deyde, Larisa V. Gubareva, Alexander I. Klimov, Joseph S. Bresee, and Alicia M. Fry An outbreak of oseltamivir-resistant in ﬂ uenza A (H1N1) occurred in a long-term care facility. Eight (47%) of 17 and 1 (6%) of 16 residents in 2 wards had oseltamivir-resistant inﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) infections. Initial outbreak response included treatment and prophylaxis with oseltamivir. The out-break abated, likely because of infection control measures. Outbreaks of in ﬂ uenza virus infection cause illness and death, especially among residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs). In addition to annual vaccination and in-fection control measures, antiviral agents for treatment and prophylaxis are useful components for control of in ﬂ uenza outbreaks in LTCFs ( 1–4), especially in years with vaccine strain mismatches ( 4). Two classes of antiviral agents are licensed for use in the United States: adamantanes (amantadine and rimanta-dine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zana-mivir). Circulation of in ﬂ uenza A viruses resistant to both classes of antiviral agents, A (H3N2) to adamantanes and A (H1N1) to oseltamivir, was reported during the 2007–08 inﬂ uenza season ( 5). We describe an outbreak of illness in an LTCF caused by 2 in ﬂ uenza viruses, an oseltamivir- resistant A virus (H1N1) and an adamantane-resistant A virus (H3N2), during January 2008. The Study The LTCF in Illinois provides housing, healthcare services, and recreational activities for residents with neu-rologic and developmental medical conditions. During the outbreak, the LTCF housed 583 residents. Building A, the main site of the in ﬂ uenza outbreak, housed 108 residents in 6 wards; 104 (96%) received the 2007–08 in ﬂ uenza vac- cine. Of the 685 LTCF employees involved in direct patient care, 385 (56%) received the 2007–08 in ﬂ uenza vaccine on site. We de ﬁ ned a con ﬁ rmed case as a positive rapid or reverse transcription–PCR result for in ﬂ uenza virus from January 20 through February 8, 2008, in a resident of the LTCF. Surveillance for new case-patients included obtain-ing a nasopharyngeal specimen from all residents with new onset of fever or respiratory symptoms or any unusual be-havior within 24 hours after illness onset. All specimens were tested by using the QuickVue A and B In ﬂ uenza Test (Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA). A second specimen was obtained from all persons with positive rapid test results and some (57%) from persons with negative results for con ﬁ r- mation of in ﬂ uenza virus infection and virus subtyping by reverse transcription–PCR. Medical records, vaccination records, resident activity, and visitor logs were reviewed. Testing for antiviral drug resistance was conducted di- rectly on clinical specimens by pyrosequencing as described (6,7), including identi ﬁ cation of the oseltamivir resistance– conferring H274Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene of inﬂ uenza viruses (H1N1) (H275Y in N1 numbering) and the adamantane resistance–conferring mutations in the ma-trix 2 protein ( 7,8). The HA1 portion of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the outbreak viruses was sequenced and com-pared with those of epidemiologically relevant viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of HA1 was performed by using MEGA version 4.0.1 software ( 9). A phylogenetic tree was inferred by using maximum composite likelihood available in MEGA version 4.0.1. The outbreak investigation was considered a public health response and granted exemption from review by the Institutional Review Board of the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention. On January 27, the ﬁ rst 3 residents with fever or respi- ratory symptoms in ward 1 within building A were positive for in ﬂ uenza A virus infection by rapid test (Figure 1). On January 28, outbreak infection control measures were initi-ated in all 6 wards, including surveillance for new cases, 5 days of treatment with oseltamivir for con ﬁ rmed cases, and 14 days of prophylaxis with oseltamivir for all healthy residents in wards with con ﬁ rmed case-patients ( 2). Con- ﬁ rmed case-patients were quarantined in their rooms for 10 days; all residents in all 6 wards were quarantined for 10 days, and visitor movement was restricted.

visitors were required to use personal protective equipment and practice respiratory and hand hygiene. Prescriptions for prophylactic courses of oseltamivir and in ﬂ uenza vac- cinations were offered to all staff of building A; uptake was not recorded. From January 28 through January 31, 2008, a total of 6 additional con ﬁ rmed case-patients were identi ﬁ ed. Eight (47%) of 17 residents in ward 1 and 1 (6%) of 16 residents in ward 2 were infected with in ﬂ uenza A viruses (H1N1) that contained the H274Y mutation but did not have mark-ers of resistance to adamantanes or zanamivir. On January 30, high fever developed in a male resident in ward 3 while on the ﬁ rst day of a home visit (Figure 1). He returned to building A on January 31, was positive for inﬂ uenza by rapid test, and was placed in ward 2 in an at- tempt to group him with other already ill residents. Because of an ongoing outbreak in other nearby wards, oseltamivir prophylaxis was initiated for all residents in ward 3 who were not ill. On February 1, symptoms developed in 2 other residents in ward 3 who were positive for in ﬂ uenza by rap- id test. Three (18%) con ﬁ rmed cases of in ﬂ uenza A virus (H3N2) resistant to adamantanes but sensitive to oseltami-vir were detected among 17 residents in ward 3. Additional cases, but no clusters, were detected in other buildings 1–2 weeks later.Characteristics of case-patients are shown in the Ta- ble. Establishing a ﬁ rm epidemiologic link between cases, other than ward of residency, was not possible. Antivi-ral drug resistance results became available on February 7 when all case-patients had completed their treatment courses. Ongoing prophylaxis courses were changed: os-eltamivir was replaced with rimantadine in ward 1, and rimantadine was added to oseltamivir in ward 2. Prophy-laxis with oseltamivir alone was continued in ward 3. Zanamivir could not be used by most residents because of underlying conditions. Sequence analysis of the HA1 gene in outbreak in ﬂ u- enza A viruses (H1N1) showed identical or nearly iden-tical sequences, differing by only 1 or 2 nt (Figure 2). These viruses were phylogenetically more closely related to A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) than to the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006, the in ﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) strain in the 2007–08 in ﬂ uenza vaccine. GenBank accession numbers of HA (HA1) sequences for the 9 oseltamivir-resistant in-ﬂ uenza A viruses (H1N1) are FJ231752–FJ231760. Conclusions The attack rate of illness caused by oseltamivir-re- sistant in ﬂ uenza A viruses (H1N1) in ward 1 was within the range (20%–80%) reported for other facility in ﬂ uenza outbreaks ( 1,10,11), indicating effective person-to-person transmission of oseltamivir-resistant in ﬂ uenza A viruses (H1N1). Nosocomial transmission of oseltamivir-resis-tant in ﬂ uenza A viruses (H1N1), with possible healthcare worker involvement, has been described ( 12).

However, this ﬁ nding could re ﬂ ect natural variance in circulating viruses. Red indicates outbreak viruses, boldface italics indicates vaccine strain for 2008–09, boldface indicates vaccine strain for 2007–08, and arrows indicate nucleotide differences in HA1 subunit. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site.

Outbreak of Antiviral Drug–Resistant In ﬂ uenza A able to assess staff illness in this investigation. Before the 2007–08 in ﬂ uenza season, transmission of neuraminidase- resistant in ﬂ uenza viruses had rarely been reported ( 13). Although we documented a relatively high attack rate in 1 ward (ward 1), and despite resistance to the antivi-ral agent initially used, the outbreak abated quickly. High annual vaccination rates among residents and relatively high rates among employees ( 2) may have played a role in limiting the spread of the outbreak viruses. However, the A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)–like outbreak viruses were not optimally matched to the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1) vaccine strain ( 14). Also, infection control mea- sures, such as isolation and quarantine, likely played a role in controlling this outbreak. The proportion of circulating in ﬂ uenza viruses resistant to oseltamivir increased from 12% during the 2007–08 sea-son to 99% during the 2008–09 season in the United States, and new interim guidelines for use of antiviral agents were released in December 2008 ( 15). These guidelines were up- dated for the 2009–10 season to account for the emergence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in September 2009 (www.cdc.gov/h1n1 ﬂ u/recommendations.htm). This outbreak un- derscores the possibility of 2 in ﬂ uenza A viruses, with dif- ferent antiviral susceptibilities, in the same facility. During a facility outbreak of in ﬂ uenza, providers should consult antiviral recommendations of the Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention and obtain in ﬂ uenza virus typing and subtyping to guide appropriate antiviral drug choices.

Sympatry of 2 Hantavirus Strains, Paraguay, 2003–2007 Yong-Kyu Chu, Douglas Goodin, Robert D. Owen,1 David Koch, and Colleen B. Jonsson To explore geographic and host-taxonomic patterns of hantaviruses in Paraguay, we established sampling sites in the Mbaracayú Biosphere Reserve. We detected Jaborá vi-rus and Itapúa37/Juquitiba–related virus in locations ≈20 m apart in different years, which suggested sympatry of 2 dis-tinct hantaviruses. Hantaviruses are rodent-borne viruses that may cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in humans, although some strains do not cause disease ( 1,2). In Paraguay in 1995, Laguna Ne- gra virus carried by Calomys laucha (little laucha) caused an outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in western Paraguay ( 3). We have identi ﬁ ed 4 additional strains in Paraguay: Alto Paraguay virus harbored by Holochilus chacarius (Chacoan marsh rat) in western Paraguay; and Ape Aime virus (AAIV) harbored by Akodon montensis (Montane akodont), Itapúa virus strain 37 (IPV37) harbored by Oli- goryzomys nigripes (black-footed colilargo), and Bermejo virus strain Ñeembucu harbored by O. chacoensis (Cha- coan colilargo) in eastern Paraguay ( 4,5). We have contin- ued our surveillance of hantaviruses in the interior Atlantic forests within and near Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbara-cayú (RNBM), a World Biosphere Reserve located within Departamento Canindeyú in eastern Paraguay (Figure 1). The Study We established and sampled 10 mark-recapture sites within and adjacent to RNBM during 2003–2007. Sampling of grids depended upon weather conditions, the purpose of the grid, and transitory human settlements. Each mark-re-capture grid consisted of an 11 × 11 array of trap stations spaced 10 m apart, each of which had 1 standard live trap (H.B. Sherman Traps, Tallahassee, FL, USA) placed on the ground, and another in branches or vines 2–3 m above ground to capture arboreal species. Grids were sampled for 8 nights, with at least 2 months between sampling sessions. Rodents captured in the mark-recapture grids were individ-ually marked with passive integrated transponder tags, and ≈100 μL of blood was collected from the retroorbital sinus (once per trapping session). Animals were identi ﬁ ed to spe- cies, age class, reproductive condition, sex, and weight and released. Rodents were also collected in a series of traplines, each of which contained 50 traps placed ≈10 m apart. Ani- mals collected in traplines were killed, standard collecting information was recorded, and liver, lung, heart, kidney, muscle tissues, and blood specimens were collected. All samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, transported to the Museum of Texas Tech University (TTU), and stored at –80°C. Standard voucher specimens were prepared from these animals, and have or will be deposited in the Muse-um of TTU or the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural del Paraguay. All ﬁ eld protocols followed American Society of Mammologists guidelines for the use of wild mammals in research ( 6), and were reviewed and approved by the TTU Animal Care and Use Committee. A total of 1,150 small mammals from >20 species were captured, including 13 sigmodontine rodent species Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1977 1Current af ﬁ liation: Martín Barrios 2230 c/ Pizarro, Barrio Republicano, Asunción, Paraguay.Author af ﬁ litions: Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, Ala- bama, USA (Y.-K.

(1,140 animals) (online Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1977-Techapp.pdf). The dominant rodent species in Mbaracayú were A. mon- tensis (55.7%), Necromys lasiurus (hairy-tailed akodont) (10.8%), C. callosus (big laucha) (6.5%), and O. fornesi (Fornes’ colilargo) (6.3%). Antibodies to hantavirus antigens were detected in blood specimens by using an indirect immuno ﬂ uorescent an- tibody assay and irradiation-sterilized slides of Vero E6 cells infected with Andes virus as described ( 4). Seven species were antibody positive: A. montensis , N. lasiurus , O. forne- si, O. nigripes , Oligoryzomys sp., Oryzomys megacephalus (Azara’s broad-headed Oryzomys sp.), and Oxymycterus de- lator (Paraguayan hocicudo). Antibodies to hantavirus anti- gens were 3× more abundant in blood samples from males than females (online Technical Appendix). Total RNA was extracted from antibody-positive blood clots from mark-recapture samples or lung tissue from killed animals. Nested reverse transcription–PCR was performed to amplify a 371-nt small (S) hantavirus RNA segment ( 4). Hantavirus RNA was detected in 23 A. mon- tensis , 5 O. fornesi , 1 O. nigripes , and 1 Oligoryzomys sp. Of these animals, all but 2 A. montensis were males, which indicated that male rodents play the primary role in mainte-nance and transmission of hantavirus. A representative sample (15 A. montensis , 3 O. fornesi , 1 O. nigripes , and 1 Oligoryzomys sp.) were selected for additional PCR, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. PCR-ampli ﬁ ed cDNAs of a 1,014-nt amino terminus re- gion of the S segment were puri ﬁ ed by agarose gel electro- phoresis and cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) ( 4,5). M13 forward and reverse primers were used for sequencing. For sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis, sequences of representative New and Old World hantaviruses were obtained from GenBank. Phylogeny re-construction was conducted by using Modeltest version 3.6 analysis (http://darwin.uvigo.es/software/modeltest.html.), maximum-likelihood estimation, and Bayesian inference (Figure 2). Bayesian analysis based on the 1,014-nt sequence showed that all sequences from A. montensis formed a strongly supported clade, which included AAIV-related hantaviruses from Itapúa Department, Jaborá virus (JABV) from southern Brazil, and strains from RNBM in Paraguay (Figure 2, clade C1). Phylogenetic analyses identi ﬁ ed 3 subclades representing virus sequences from animals in the RNBM, Itapúa, and southern Brazil. This type of geograph-ic clustering is similar to Sin Nombre–related viruses in deer mice in North America ( 7). All S segment sequences from A. montensis were closely related, with nucleotide se- quence differences between RNBM strains and AAIV and JABV of 4% and 12%, respectively, and derived amino acid differences of 0% or 1%, respectively (Table 1).In contrast, all virus sequences from O. fornesi , O. ni- gripes , and Oryzomys sp. at RNBM formed a strongly sup- ported clade with viruses related to Juquitiba virus (JUQV) from Brazil and Itapúa virus strain 37, which was originally detected in O. nigripes from Itapúa Department in eastern Paraguay (Figure 2, clade C2d). Nucleotide sequence dif-ferences between JUQV strains from RNBM were 0%–2%. Nucleotide sequence differences between JUQV strains from RNBM and Itapúa virus strain 37 or JUQV (Brazil) were 5% or 4%, respectively, and derived amino acid dif-ferences were 0% (Table 1).

Sympatry of 2 Hantavirus Strains, Paraguay distinct from viruses that form the Akodon montensis clade at RNBM and more closely related to Andes (clade C2b) and Bermejo-Ñeembucú (clade C2a) viruses. This ﬁ nding suggests that spillover infection of JUQV-related viruses is actively occurring among oryzomyine rodent species at RNBM, as reported for other hantaviruses in oryzomyines (8) and other rodent hosts of Old World hantaviruses ( 9,10). Additional data are needed to determine the primary oryzo-myine reservoir of JUQV and to better understand mecha-nisms by which spillover occurs. In addition to spillover infection of JUQV among ory- zomyine rodents, we identi ﬁ ed 2 virus strains (JUQV and JABV) in close proximity (collected ≈20 m apart on the same grid in the same sampling session) on 2 occasions, in sites separated by ≈30 km (Figure 1; Table 2). Thus, these 2 distinct hantaviruses appear to be maintaining a sympatric status across a considerable expanse of landscape, rather than re ﬂ ecting a temporary or localized phenomenon. We use the term sympatric to underscore that these viruses are in the same community and are near enough (their rodent reservoirs) to interact.Conclusions Coexistence of hantaviruses in 2 rodent species at mark-recapture sites has been observed ( 11–13). Serolog- ic analyses in these studies would not have differentiated whether distinct strains of hantaviruses were co-circulating or active spillover infection was occurring among sym-patric rodents at collection sites. Recently, Raboni et al. reported JUQV circulating in 3 sympatric rodent species in southern Brazil and 2 distinct hantaviruses (Jabora and JUQV) in 1 rodent species ( A. montensis ) (14). We have not detected JUQV in A. montensis in Paraguay. To address host-jumping of hantaviruses among sympatric rodent spe-cies in RNBM and other regions in South America, future longitudinal studies are warranted. Such studies are critical to understanding evolutionary adaptation of hantaviruses in rodents in South America, the ability of these viruses to adapt to new rodent reservoirs, and their emergence and maintenance in the environment.

Lemos, Márcia B.C. de Paula, Adalberto A. Pajuaba Neto, and Marcelo S. Ferreira A cross-sectional serosurvey was conducted to as- sess the proportion of persons exposed to hantaviruses in a virus-endemic area of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Findings of this study suggested the presence of >1 hanta-viruses circulating in this region causing hantavirus pulmo-nary syndrome, mild disease, or asymptomatic infection. In Brazil, >1,080 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) have been con ﬁ rmed since 1993 (case-fatality rate 40%). More HPS cases (209) are reported in the state of Minas Gerais than in any other state in Brazil (M.L. Nunes, pers. comm.). In Minas Gerais, molecular studies identi ﬁ ed a hantavirus called Araraquara virus associated with HPS cases. The wild rodent Necromys lasiurus (the hairy-tailed bolo mouse, also named Bolomys lasiurus ) was implicated as a reservoir of this virus ( 1). Because asymptomatic in- fection with hantaviruses also has been detected in Minas Gerais, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the proportion of persons exposed to hantaviruses and to iden-tify associated risk factors. The Study The hantavirus cross-sectional survey was carried out April through May 2006 in the municipality of Uber-lândia, Minas Gerais, at an average altitude of 863 m (18º55′S,48º16′W) (Figure). A randomized and strati ﬁ ed (sex and age) sample was collected from the entire rural area and from the south sector of the municipality’s periur-ban area. The term periurban refers to a residential area on the outskirts of the city that is in close contact with the rural area. The participants answered a questionnaire that includ-ed demographic information (sex, age, place of birth, and address) and questions relating to HPS risk factors (type of dwelling, exposure to rodents at home or work, labor activity, risk activities, history of severe pneumonia, and direct contact with HPS patients). Blood samples were col-lected by venipuncture, centrifuged, and sent to the Labora-tory of Hantaviruses and Rickettsioses at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for analysis. The ethics review board of the Federal University of Uberlândia ap-proved the study.

We screened serum samples by ELISA for hantavi- rus-speci ﬁ c immunoglobulin G using a recombinant an- tigen of the nucleocapsid protein of Araraquara virus, produced in Escherichia coli and supplied by the Virus Research Unit of the University of São Paulo, Brazil, ac-cording to the procedure previously described ( 2). All positive serum samples were retested; only those that had 3 ELISA-positive results at >1:400 dilutions were consid-ered positive. The Mann-Whitney U and Fisher exact/binomial tests for 2 proportions were applied for comparison among me-dians and proportions, respectively, using EPI INFO 3.3.2 (www.cdc.gov/epiinfo) and BIOSTAT 5.0 (www.biostat.org) software. Fisher exact test was used to estimate the odds ratio and 95% con ﬁ dence intervals. The 400 study participants comprised 200 rural and 200 periurban residents ranging in age from 12 to 76 years (mean = 41 years). Twelve (3%) samples were hantavirus antibody-positive by ELISA. The 8 rural area antibody-positive samples were from male farmers (Table 1). Pres-ence of antibody was signi ﬁ cantly associated with male sex, older age class, and potential risk activities (Table 1). Although all case-patients reported exposure to rodents or their excreta, this exposure was not statistically sig-niﬁ cant (Table 1). In the periurban area, the presence of antibody was associated with age but not with sex, risk activity, or exposure to rodents (Table 1). The mean age of seropositive persons from periurban and rural areas was similar (p = 1.0). The relationship between antibody and sex depended on urban vs. rural residence (p = 0.02). Three antibody-positive persons in the rural zone and 2 in the urban zone reported a history of pneumonia, albeit without complications. We examined data from an HPS outbreak in Uberlândia during 1998–2005. The largest number of cases occurred among periurban residents, but the highest cumulative in-cidence was among rural residents (Table 2). Nevertheless, rural and periurban areas did not differ signi ﬁ cantly in ei- ther prevalence or incidence. We found higher prevalence among rural residents (Table 2). Conclusions Overall hantavirus antibody prevalence among periur- ban residents was 2.0%, with a higher prevalence among women (2.6%). In previous studies, the prevalence of han-tavirus antibodies was higher in men ( 4–6). All the positive samples in the rural area came from male farm workers. This ﬁ nding is similar to a situation reported in Colombia, where all positive samples came from men engaged in rural activities ( 6). These activities involve a high risk for infec- tion by hantaviruses ( 7). In this study, hantavirus positivity was found only in persons >39 years of age, and the difference in the mean age of the participants in relation to positivity was signi ﬁ - cant. This fact might suggest a historic high-risk event to which the older age class, but not the younger age class, was exposed. High hantavirus antibody prevalence has been found in studies of some human populations in Latin America (5,8,9). The prevalence of Araraquara virus–reactive an- tibodies among the volunteers in this study demonstrates that transmission is not rare, reinforcing the hypothesis of the existence of mild disease or asymptomatic infections (10). Two hypotheses have been proposed: clinically mild disease or inapparent infections might result from differ-ences in the nature of exposure (e.g., low inoculum or inef-ﬁ cient mechanism of transmission) or genetic differences in immune response to infection, or they might indicate the circulation of >1 hantavirus genotypes of greatly reduced virulence ( 10,11 ).DISPATCHES 1982 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Table 1.

Bartonella rochalimae in Raccoons, Coyotes, and Red Foxes Jennifer B. Henn, Bruno B. Chomel, Henri-Jean Boulouis, Rickie W. Kasten, William J. Murray, Gila K. Bar-Gal, Roni King, Jean-François Courreau, and Gad Baneth To determine additional reservoirs for Bartonella roch- alimae , we examined samples from several wildlife spe- cies. We isolated B. rochalimae from 1 red fox near Paris, France, and from 11 raccoons and 2 coyotes from Califor-nia, USA. Co-infection with B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i was documented in 1 of the coyotes. Twelve Bartonella species/subspecies have been recog- nized as zoonotic agents ( 1,2), including B. rochalimae isolated from a woman who had traveled from the United States to Peru before becoming ill with fever, splenomeg-aly, mild anemia, and rash ( 3). B. rochalimae , previously described as a B. clarridgeiae –like organism, has also been isolated from rural domestic dogs and gray foxes ( Uro- cyon cinereoargenteus ) from northern California ( 4,5). A case of fatal endocarditis in a domestic dog was associated with a B. clarridgeiae –like strain ( 6), later determined to be identical to B. rochalimae (5). Recently, B. rochalimae DNA was detected in a dog from Greece ( 7). High (43%) prevalence of bacteremia observed in gray foxes in Cali-fornia suggests that they might act as a wildlife reservoir for this newly identi ﬁ ed species. Furthermore, several B. clarridgeiae –like and B. rochalimae genes have been de- tected in ﬂ eas collected from humans ( 8), rodents ( 9,10), red foxes ( Vulpes vulpes ) (11), and the environment in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( 12) during a plague out- break. To determine whether other wildlife reservoirs ex-ist, we tested samples from 3 additional wildlife species: coyotes, raccoons, and red foxes.The Study From 1996 through 1999 in central coastal California, 21 Canis latrans coyotes (3 juveniles [<1 year of age] and 18 adults) and 42 Procyon lotor raccoons (11 juveniles and 31 adults) were trapped. In 2002, a blood sample was col-lected from a road-killed red fox near Paris, France. All samples were collected in EDTA tubes and frozen at −70°C until plated on heart infusion agar containing 5% rabbit blood and incubated in 5% CO 2 at 35°C for up to 4 weeks (13); subsequently, extracted DNA was tested for Barto- nella spp. by PCR. In addition, from May 2003 through September 2004, blood was collected from 42 red foxes (23 females and 19 males; 2 kits [<1 year] and 40 adults) in Israel, and extracted DNA was tested for Bartonella spp. by PCR. Bartonella isolates from 2 (9.5%) coyotes (coyote 004 [7-month-old male] and coyote 22 [adult female cap-tured in central California], which yielded 2 different-size colonies: coyote 22/sub1, large size; coyote 22/sub2, small size), 11 (26%) of the raccoons (7 adult females and 4 adult males), the 1 (100%) red fox from France, and DNA from the blood of 2 (5%) foxes from Israel were compared with B. rochalimae strains isolated from a human, rural dogs, and gray foxes. Bartonella isolates were analyzed by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 16S–23S intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region (all strains) and the gltA, rpoB and ftsZ genes (raccoons, gray foxes, coyotes, and dogs), as previously described ( 5). For the isolate from the red fox from France, extracted DNA was also ampli ﬁ ed for fragments of the groEL gene by using the primer sets HSPps1, HSPps2, and HSPsp4 (11,14). Sequencing was done in both directions by using a ﬂ uorescence-based automated sequencing system (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA, USA). Sequences were imported into Vector NTI Suite 9.0 software (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to obtain a consensus sequence. Align X in Vec-tor NTI was used for aligning sequence variants with each other and other known Bartonella spp. for each of the 4 genes. A neighbor-joining tree was constructed in MEGA version 3.0 (www.megasoftware.net) by concatenating the 4 sequences. Bootstrap replicates were performed to esti-mate node reliability of the phylogenetic tree; values were obtained from 1,000 randomly selected samples of the aligned sequence data. Sequence data for the groEL gene of the isolate from the fox in France (GenBank accession no. FJ545656 ) was compared with sequences of DNA extract- ed from ﬂ eas collected on 4 foxes from Hungary ( 11) and deposited in GenBank under accession no. DQ522300. Ampli ﬁ ed PCR products were obtained from the ITS region and the gltA, rpoB, and ftsZ genes of all isolates. Isolates from coyote 004 and coyote 22/sub2, the red fox from France, and the 11 raccoons had identical RFLP pro-ﬁ les, also identical to those observed in the rural dogs and DISPATCHES 1984 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Author af ﬁ liations: Napa County Health and Human Services, Napa, California, USA (J.B.

B. rochalimae in Raccoons, Coyotes, and Red Foxes gray foxes from California ( 5). Isolate sub1 from coyote 22 had banding patterns identical to those of Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i (American Type Culture Col- lection 51672), indicating co-infection with B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i and B. rochalimae . Consensus sequenc- es were obtained for isolates from all coyotes and the red fox from France. Because the RFLP pro ﬁ les for the 11 raccoon isolates were identical, only 2 isolates (from rac-coons 60 and 75, adult females from central California) were selected for sequencing and were identical for all genes. Partial sequences from the 4 genes were identi-cal for the isolates from coyote 004 and the 2 raccoons. These isolates were 100% similar to a strain recovered from the dog with endocarditis (GenBank accession nos. DQ676488–DQ676491) ( 5,6). The B. rochalimae isolate sub2 from coyote 22 was identical to isolates from rural dogs and gray foxes from northern California (accession nos. DQ676484–DQ676487). Similarity of isolates from these regions ranged from 99.5% to 100% (Tables 1,2). A tree constructed from the merged set of concatenated sequences (Figure 1) demonstrates that isolate sub2 from coyote 22 clustered with isolates from the dog and gray fox from northern California; those from coyote 004 and raccoon 60 grouped with those from the dog with endocarditis.According to PCR results and comparison of a 571- bp sequence ampli ﬁ ed from the ITS region, the sequences from 2 foxes (1 male, 1 female) from 2 villages in northern Israel were identical to each other and to that from the fox from France (Figure 2). Differences of 2–5 bp were ob-served among ITS region sequences when comparing those from the foxes from Israel and France with those from B. rochalimae from gray foxes and raccoons from California. When the groEL partial sequence FJ545656 from the red fox from France was compared with sequence DQ522300 from a Pulex irritans ﬂ ea collected from foxes from Hunga- ry, the 156-bp fragment (based on the consensus sequence from both directions) from the red fox from France was 100% identical to that of the ﬂ ea. Conclusions We report the isolation or detection of B. rochalimae from red foxes, raccoons, and coyotes from North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Sequence analysis of 4 genes identi ﬁ ed small variations in the B. rochalimae isolates from these different geographic regions. A relatively high percentage (26%) of raccoons had B. rochalimae bacter- emia compared with only 9.5% (2/21) coyotes. A previous study found that of 109 coyotes, none were infected with B. rochalimae , but 31 (28%) harbored B. vinsonii subsp.

berkhof ﬁ i (13). In raccoons, bacteremia was found in adults only, which is surprising because for all animals in general, Bartonella spp. bacteremia is detected more frequently in younger animals ( 1). Gray foxes from northern California had B. rochalimae bacteremia prevalence of 42% ( 4), sug- gesting that gray foxes and raccoons could be natural res-ervoirs of B. rochalimae in California and that infection of coyotes and domestic dogs could result from occasional spillover. Co-infection of a coyote also illustrates that wild canids can simultaneously harbor >1 species of Bartonella . Co-infection of humans with B. henselae and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i has also been reported ( 15). Additionally, co-infection with 2 zoonotic Bartonella species in this coy- ote raises the possibility that humans and domestic dogs could also be co-infected with these species, making appro-priate diagnosis more dif ﬁ cult. Pulex ﬂ eas collected on red foxes from Hungary ( 11) were indeed infected with a strain of Bartonella that was identical, at least for the groEL par- tial sequence, with that of the isolate from the red fox from France, suggesting that red foxes from central Europe may also be infected with B. rochalimae . Future studies with larger sample sizes will be needed to better de ﬁ ne the role of these wild carnivores—red foxes, raccoons, and coy- otes—in maintaining B. rochalimae in the environment.

CTX-M β-Lactamase Production and Virulence of Escherichia coli K1 Damien Dubois, Nemani V. Prasadarao, Rahul Mittal, Laurent Bret, Marie Roujou-Gris, and Richard Bonnet We report a patient with neonatal meningitis caused by a CTX-M-1–producing Escherichia coli K1 strain. The in ﬂ u- ence of CTX-M production on virulence was investigated in cell culture and a newborn mouse model of meningitis. CTX-M production had no in ﬂ uence on virulence but was a major factor in clinical outcome. Escherichia coli is the second most common cause of neonatal meningitis. Neonatal meningitis E. coli (NMEC) belong mainly to phylogenetic group B2 and har-bor numerous virulence factors ( 1). Since the beginning of the 21st century, an explosive spread of CTX-M–type extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) in E. coli has occurred ( 2). These enzymes con- fer resistance to nearly all β-lactam antimicrobial drugs, including third-generation cephalosporins, the ﬁ rst-line treatment for patients with serious E. coli infections. How- ever, CTX-M–type ESBLs have been observed mainly in E. coli strains with few virulence factors or in strains caus- ing minor infections ( 3–5). In addition, bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs is frequently reported as dif ﬁ cult to reconcile with bacterial virulence ( 6). Highly pathogenic E. coli such as NMEC are therefore considered susceptible to antimicrobial drugs ( 7). We report a clinical case of neo- natal meningitis caused by CTX-M–producing NMEC and the in ﬂ uence of CTX-M production on virulence. The Study In April 2007, a 39-year-old pregnant woman with am- niotic sac rupture was admitted to a hospital in Orleans, France, at 28 weeks and 4 days of gestation. Treatment was started with betamethasone (12 mg 1×/d) for fetal lung maturation and amoxicillin (1g 3×/d) for 4 days. Because of a high serum level of C-reactive protein, antimicrobial drug therapy was switched to amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (1g 3×/d) for 1 day. A cesarean delivery was performed at 29 weeks and 2 days of gestation. A lumbar puncture sam-ple of the low-weight (1,560 g) newborn female was tinged with blood. Cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) protein and glucose values were 4.00 g/L and 3.5 mmol/L, respectively. Results of CSF Gram staining were negative. The infant was admitted to the neonatal critical care unit and received amoxicillin (150 mg), cefotaxime (120 mg), and netilmicin (8 mg) 2×/d for 2 days. Culture of pla-centa, maternal and infant blood, and infant gastric ﬂ uid yielded E. coli. The isolate was resistant to antimicrobial drugs, including third-generation cephalosporins. Imipen-em/cilastatin (25 mg 4×/d) and amikacin (15 mg 2×/d) were given for 2 days. Treatment with imipenem/cilastatin was given for 15 days and then stopped because of the infant’s clinical improvement and return of C-reactive protein to the reference level. Similar drug treatment was adminis-trated to the mother. One week after drug treatment was discontinued, the infant showed signs of septicemia. A second lumbar punc-ture sample had protein and glucose levels of 4.56 g/L and 0.1 mmol/L, respectively, and a leukocyte count of 4,700 cells/μL (54% polymorphonuclear cells). E. coli were iso- lated from blood and CSF cultures and showed a resistance pattern identical to that of the previous isolate. Meningitis was a complication of the initial sepsis or a relapse of initial unapparent meningitis ( 8). Treatment was started with imipenem/cilastatin (30 mg 4×/d) for 25 days and amikacin (15 mg 2×/d) for 5 days. Because the infant had a seizure, phenobarbital (22.5 mg) and cipro ﬂ oxacin (15 mg 2×/d) were prescribed for 5 ad- ditional days. Her condition gradually improved and blood and CSF values returned to reference levels. The infant was discharged from the hospital 1 month later and treatment with the anticonvulsant was discontinued. She showed normal psychomotor development at a regular follow-up pediatric visit. E. coli strains isolated from the mother and infant were indistinguishable by enterobacterial repetitive in-tergenic consensus sequence 2 PCR, random ampli ﬁ ed polymorphic DNA analysis, and typing with a MALDI BioTyper (Bruker Daltonique, Wissembourg, France) (9). Thus, the isolates corresponded to the same strain, designated Orl-1. PCR-based phylogenetic analysis and serotyping showed that the strain belonged to group B2 and serotype O7:K1:H7, a major O antigen encountered worldwide in NMEC ( 1). Resistance of the Orl-1 strain (MICs 128 μg/mL for cefotaxime and 8 μg/mL for ceftazidime) was caused by DISPATCHES 1988 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Author af ﬁ liations: University of Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France (D.

CTX-M β-Lactamase and Virulence of E. coli K1 the gene encoding CTX-M-1. This strain was also resis- tant to tetracycline, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole and susceptible to cefoxitin, imipenem, aminoglycosides, quinolones, chloramphenicol, and fosfomycin. It harbored the major E. coli genes associated with neonatal meningitis (Table 1) ( 1,10). Plasmids from Orl-1 were used to transform E. coli K-12 DH5 α. Three resistance pro ﬁ les that enabled detec- tion of 3 plasmids were obtained. On the basis of screening of plasmid transformants and Orl-1, most virulence factors genes were presumably chromosomally encoded. Three virulence factors ( aer, iss, and a second copy of iroN) were mediated by a tetracycline-resistant, large ( ≈180 kb), con- jugative plasmid (pOrl-1-Te). The 2 other plasmids were pOrl-1-CTX-M-1, the CTX-M-1–encoding large ( ≈150 kb) conjugative plasmid carrying resistance to trimethop-rim and sulfamethoxazole, and pOrl-1-TEM-1, a TEM–1-encoding small (<40 kb) plasmid. A derivative strain that did not harbor the 3 plasmids (Orl-c) was obtained by plasmid elimination with ethidium bromide. Orl-1, Orl-c, and E. coli DH5α harboring pOrl-1- CTX-M-1 were tested for invasiveness in human brain mi-crovascular endothelial cells ( 10) and in a newborn mouse (C57BL/6 wild-type) model of meningitis (R. Mittal et al., unpub. data) to investigate the in ﬂ uence of CTX-M-1 production on virulence. E. coli strain E44, a rifampicin- resistant mutant of archetypical NMEC K1 strain RS218, was used as a positive control ( 10). Orl-1 and Orl-c strains exhibited 3.5× lower inva- siveness than strain E44. However, their ability to invade human brain microvascular endothelial cells was 400× higher than that of strain DH5 α–CTX-M1. In the mouse model, DH5 α–CTX-M1 did not cause bacteremia or men- ingitis. In contrast, Orl-1, Orl-c, and E44 induced menin-gitis (prevalences of 100%, 84%, and 85%, respectively) (Table 2). The difference between Orl-1 and Orl-c in the mouse model may be explained by loss of plasmid pOrl-1-Te from Orl-c. Plasmid pOrl-1-Te is likely similar to pS88-related plasmids of NMEC because they share 3 virulence factor genes ( iss, aer, and iroN) and are large and conjugative. These plasmids contribute to virulence of NMEC ( 11). Orl-1 and Orl-c showed similar behaviors, which suggest-ed that the CTX-M-1–encoding plasmid pOrl-1-CTX-M-1 does not alter virulence of the strain.Mice with E44- and Orl-1–induced neonatal menin- gitis were treated with the third-generation cephalosporin cefotaxime, as recommended for humans. Despite antimi-crobial drug treatment, Orl-1, but not strain E44, caused meningitis, suggesting that drug resistance is a major factor in clinical outcomes. Conclusions Studies have reported emergence of E. coli as the pre- dominant organisms responsible for sepsis at any gesta-tional age and for increased rates of drug-resistant E. coli caused by intrapartum drug prophylaxis ( 12). Spread of ESBLs in E. coli and intrapartum exposure to antimicrobial drugs may favor emergence of NMEC strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. Two other well-characterized E. coli K1 strains pro- ducing ESBLs have been isolated from patients with neo-natal meningitis in Algeria and France. The ESBL was identi ﬁ ed as CTX-M-15 in both patients, and 1 infection was lethal ( 13,14 ). Other putative ESBL-producing E. coli K1 have been recently isolated, especially in developing countries ( 15). Emergence of ESBL-producing E. coli strains, which are frequently resistant to ﬂ uoroquinolone ( 2), highlights the need for possible alternatives to third-generation ce- Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1989 Table 2.

phalosporins for treatment of patients with infected with NMEC. Carbapenems are usually recommended for treat-ment of infections with ESBL-producing E. coli (2). How- ever, this case report shows the role of treatment duration and the need for additional pharmacokinetic and safety studies in neonates and for adjunctive therapies ( 8). This characterization of a CTX-M-1–producing NMEC strain highlights the emergence of CTX-M–type ESBL in highly virulent E. coli. Because of worldwide spread of CTX-Ms, caution should be exercised in the management of patients with NMEC, and ﬁ rst-line treatment for neona- tal meningitis may need to be reconsidered.

Ehrlichia chaffeensis Infection of Sika Deer, Japan Makoto Kawahara, Tomoko Tajima, Harumi Torii, Mitsutaka Yabutani, Joji Ishii, Makiko Harasawa, Emiko Isogai, and Yasuko Rikihisa To determine whether Ehrlichia chaffeensis exists in Japan, we used PCR to examine blood from sika deer in Nara, Japan. Of 117 deer, 36 (31%) were infected with E. chaffeensis . The E. chaffeensis 16S rRNA base and GroEL amino acid sequences from Japan were most closely re-lated to those of E. chaffeensis Arkansas. Human infection with Ehrlichia chaffeensis causes hu- man monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), an in ﬂ uenza-like illness. Severity of the disease varies from mild to severe and can even cause death (1). HME cases have been report- ed primarily in the southeastern and south–central regions of the United States ( 1). The organism, E. chaffeensis, until recently has been reported only in the United States; however, numerous re-ports now indicate that Ehrlichiae spp. closely related or identical to E. chaffeensis exist throughout the world ( 1,2). In the United States, E. chaffeensis has been most frequent- ly identi ﬁ ed in the lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ) (3). E. chaffeensis DNA has also been detected in A. testu- dinarium and Haemaphysalis yeni ticks from southern Peo- ple’s Republic of China ( 4), in H. longicornis ticks from South Korea ( 5), and in A. parvum ticks in Argentina ( 6). Other than A. americanum , the role of these tick species as E. chaffeensis vectors has not been investigated. The white- tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) is the only vertebrate species currently recognized as a complete and suf ﬁ cient host for maintaining the transmission cycle of E. chaffeen- sis (3,7). To look for molecular evidence of E. chaffeensis in sika deer ( Cervus nippon ) in Japan, we examined blood specimens by using PCR ampli ﬁ cation of the 16S rRNA and groEL genes.The Study In Nara, Japan, to prevent injuries to park visitors, the Foundation for the Protection of Sika Deer in Nara Park captured 97 pregnant female sika deer in April 2005 and 20 male sika deer with antlers in November 2005. Blood specimens were collected from all 117 deer, and buffy coat fractions were stored at –80°C for further analysis. Genom-ic DNA was extracted from the buffy coat fractions by us-ing a QIAamp tissue kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Nested PCR ampli ﬁ cation of genomic DNA was performed by using primer pairs designed to amplify the E. chaffeen- sis 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and the E. chaffeensis groEL gene (Table). Of the 117 specimens, 36 (31%) yielded E. chaffeen- sis 16S rRNA ampli ﬁ cation products and 35 (30%) yielded E. chaffeensis groEL ampli ﬁ cation products. Of 36 16S rRNA–positive specimens, 33 were positive for groEL (92% concordance rate). Of 35 groEL -positive specimens, 33 were positive for 16S rRNA (94% concordance rate). The E. chaffeensis sequences were conserved in that all se- quences obtained from sika deer in Nara were nearly identi-cal to those of a representative strain that we named NS101 and submitted to GenBank (accession no. AB454074). The sequence of the 16S rRNA gene from E. chaffeensis NS101 was most closely related (99.6% identity; 5 bases of 1,333 bp that can be aligned for comparison differed) to that of 5 human isolates: Arkansas (GenBank accession no. M73222) ( 8), Sapulpa (U60476) ( 9), 91HE17 (U23503) (10), St. Vincent (U86665) ( 11), and Jax (U86664) ( 11); the next closest sequence was from an E. chaffeensis isolate from A. testudinarium ticks in China (GenBank accession no. AF147752) (99.2% identity; 10 bases of 1,333 bp that can be aligned for comparison differed). When E. chaffeensis NS101 was compared with Ehrli- chia spp. previously identi ﬁ ed in Japan, the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene (a 1,328-bp segment that can be aligned for comparison) of E. chaffeensis NS101 was 98.9%, 98.9%, and 98.6% identical to that of E. muris AS145 strain, Eh- rlichia sp. HF565 (the HF strain, Ixodes ovatus Ehrlichia) and Candidatus Ehrlichia shimanensis TS37, respectively. Phylogenic analysis concurred with the observation that E. chaffeensis from Nara sika deer has the highest identity to the E. chaffeensis human isolates from the United States (Figure 1). Although longer 16S rRNA gene sequences are desir- able for strain comparison, the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of E. chaffeensis from H. longicornis ticks in Korea (GenBank accession no. AY350424, 390 bp) and from A. parvum ticks in Argentina (GenBank accession no. EU826516, 470 bp) were identical to a corresponding, but incomplete, segment (358 bp and 402 bp, respectively) of the 16S rRNA gene of E. chaffeensis NS101 and Arkan- sas strains. An Ehrlichia sp. was detected in blood samples Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1991 Author af ﬁ liations: Nagoya City Public Health Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan (M.

from marsh deer ( Blastocerus dichotomus ) captured near the Parana River in southeast Brazil in 1998 ( 12). However, the 16S rRNA sequence from these marsh deer (GenBank accession no. DQ345720, 383 bp) shares 98.7% identity to a corresponding, but incomplete, segment (381 bp) of the E. chaffeensis NS101 and Arkansas strains. Because the sequences of the corresponding segments of Ehrlichia sp. HF565 and ‘ Candidatus Ehrlichia shimanensis’ TS37 both had 99.0% identity to that of E. chaffeensis Arkansas strain, higher than the 98.7%, the Ehrlichia sp. in marsh deer from Brazil might not be E. chaffeensis. Among the E. chaffeensis groEL sequences available in current databases, only that from E. chaffeensis Arkan- sas has >1,000 bp for reliable comparison. The groEL DNA sequence (1,208 bp that can be aligned) of the NS101 strain (GenBank accession no. AB454077, 1,311 bp) was most closely related to that of E. chaffeensis Arkansas (Gen- Bank accession no. L10917), followed by the Ehrlichia sp. HF565 strain (GenBank accession no. AB032712), and the E. muris AS145 strain (GenBank accession no. AF210459) (Figure 2). The deduced E. chaffeensis NS101 GroEL ami- no acid sequence (402 residues) was most closely related (99.5% identity) to that of E. chaffeensis Arkansas, fol- lowed by the Ehrlichia sp. HF565 strain (99.2% identity) and E. muris AS145 strain (99.0%).Conclusions On the basis of the long 16S rRNA and the groEL DNA sequences, our study demonstrates the presence of E. chaffeensis in sika deer from Nara, Japan. The genetic simi- larity of E. chaffeensis in the sika deer in Japan to strains isolated from HME patients in the United States raises the possibility that HME may exist in Japan. Of 1,803 serum samples collected from persons in metropolitan Tokyo from 1991 through 1995, when E. muris was used as anti- gen, 20 were seropositive ( 13). Because E. chaffeensis and E. muris antigens are highly cross-reactive ( 14), some of these persons might have been infected with E. chaffeensis . Of the 10 tick species found on sika deer ( 15), the primary tick species found on sika deer in Nara is H. longicornis, which is known to bite humans in Japan and to be infected with E. chaffeensis in South Korea ( 5). Because sika deer are abundant and increasing throughout Japan ( 16), this ﬁ nding highlights need to survey sika deer and humans in Japan for E. chaffeensis infection.DISPATCHES 1992 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Table.

Diagnostic Assay for Rickettsia japonica Nozomu Hanaoka, Minenosuke Matsutani, Hiroki Kawabata, Seigo Yamamoto, Hiromi Fujita, Akiko Sakata, Yoshinao Azuma, Motohiko Ogawa, Ai Takano, Haruo Watanabe, Toshio Kishimoto, Mutsunori Shirai, Ichiro Kurane, and Shuji Ando We developed a speci ﬁ c and rapid detection system for Rickettsia japonica and R. heilongjiangensis , the causative agents of spotted fever, using a TaqMan minor groove bind-er probe for a particular open reading frame (ORF) identi-ﬁ ed by the R. japonica genome project. The target ORF was present only in R. japonica –related strains. Rickettsia , a genus that includes the causative agents for spotted fever rickettsioses and typhus fever, comprises obligate intracellular bacteria ( 1). The ﬁ rst case of Japa- nese spotted fever (JSF), caused by R. japonica (2), was reported in 1984 in Japan ( 3). According to the national surveillance system in Japan (http://idsc.nih.go.jp/idwr/ybata/report-Ea.html), JSF cases, including sporadic cases resulting in death, have been gradually increasing. Rapid diagnosis of rickettsial infections is important because rick-ettsioses can be cured when appropriate antimicrobial drug treatment is given during the early clinical stages of the disease. Furthermore, development of a rapid and speci ﬁ c diagnostic system for R. japonica is now a matter of in- creasing urgency ( 4) because JSF has also been reported in several other countries in Asia ( 1). The Study Since 1998, thirteen complete Rickettsia genome sequences have been reported (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html). In addition, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) genome project for R. japonica strain YH has recently concluded (proj- ect ID 38487). Results of this project show speci ﬁ c DNA regions for R. japonica in the Rickettsia genome. One of these regions includes a 216-bp open reading frame (ORF) (GenBank accession no. AB437281). On the basis of in-formation from this genome project, we performed DNA sequencing for this 216-bp ORF to determine whether the speciﬁ c DNA sequences are conserved in all R. japonica strains and other closely related strains, including R. hei- longjiangensis (5) and Rickettsia sp. LON ( 6). R. heilongjiangensis is also a causative agent of spot- ted fever in northeastern Asia and has been classi ﬁ ed with- in the R. japonica group ( 5). Several studies have reported that Rickettsia. sp. LON strains also have similar sequences to R. japonica. Our PCR can easily distinguish Rickettsia sp. LON strains (LON-2, LON-9, and LON-13) from R. japonica strains. This test can help in the diagnosis because Rickettsia sp. LON strains have only been isolated from ticks and may not be pathogenic in humans ( 6). DNA sequencing was performed by using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with an ABI 3130 sequence detector. DNA sequences were aligned by ClustalW software (http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html) with an open gap penalty of 15, a gap extension penalty of 6.66, a gap distance of 8, and a maximum di-vision penalty of 40. For determination of the DNA se-quence for the 216-bp ORF, the primer pair of JapoSP5 ′ (5′-ACAACATCAATATTATAATTAGTATCC-3 ′) and JapoSP3′ (5′-TTCACGTATGTCTATATATGCTGCAG CG-3′) was used to amplify a 564-bp section, including this ORF, because this unique DNA sequence was located as the inserted sequence of the homolog for R. conorii RC1338 (Figure, panel A). The nucleotide sequence of this ORF was identical among 5 of the R. japonica strains: DT-1, YH, FLA-1, HH-8, and HH-9 (100%); the sequence was highly con-served with signi ﬁ cant identity in R. heilongjiangensis (99.5%), except for the Rickettsia sp. LON strains (92.1%; Figure, panel B). This 216-bp ORF had been previously applied to BLAST searches with NCBI blast (nblast) for humans, mice, and others (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The results showed that no similar ORF had been reported to date. Therefore, we focused on this con-served region of the 216-bp ORF to develop a TaqMan mi-nor groove binder (MGB) probe (Applied Biosystems) that could detect the pathogenic R. japonica group, including R. heilongjiangensis , with a high degree of speci ﬁ city. Oligonucleotide primers (SpRija5 ′ and SPRija3 ′) and the TaqMan MGB probe (SpRijaMGB) were designed by using Primer Express software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems Figure, panel B). The detection probe was la-beled with the ﬂ uorescent reporter FAM (carboxy ﬂ uores- cein labeling) at the 5 ′ end; the non ﬂ uorescent quencher and MGB were labeled at the 3 ′ end (Figure, panel B). The detection sequence (shown as a bold line in Figure 1, panel B) was registered in GenBank (accession no. AB437281).DISPATCHES 1994 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Author af ﬁ liations: National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan (N. Hanaoka, H.

Diagnostic Assay for Rickettsia japonica Real-time PCR was performed by using an ABI 7500 system (Applied Biosystems). DNA polymerase (perfect real-time PCR) for the PCR was obtained from Takara Bio (Kyoto, Japan). A 20- μL sample was added to each well of a 96-well microplate (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s in-structions. Thermal cycle protocol was performed as fol-lows: ﬁ rst incubation stage, 20 s at 95°C; second stage, 5 s at 95°C and 34 s at 60°C. The second stage was repeated 45 times. For analysis of real-time PCR, the threshold line was ﬁ xed at 0.2 to avoid detection of nonspeci ﬁ c ﬂ uorescence. This detection procedure can be completed within 1 h. The reactivity of this assay was examined by using various copy numbers of synthetic R. japonica DNA frag- ments that were ampli ﬁ ed by the primer pairs JapoSP5 ′ and JapoSP3′ within the R. japonica genome. Genomic DNA of R. japonica strain YH was prepared from cultivated bacte- ria according to methods proposed by Furuya et al. ( 7). A calibration curve was generated with 5 calibrators, ranging from 10 2 to 109 copies/well in triplicate. We found a linear correlation (R>0.99) between the detection cycle numbers and R. japonica DNA copy numbers from 10 2 to 109 copies/ reaction (data not shown). A total of 26 rickettsial strains, classi ﬁ ed into 11 spe- cies, were used in this study (Table 1). Speci ﬁ cities for this TaqMan PCR are also summarized in Table 1. Genomic DNA of R. prowazekii and R. rickettsii were prepared from antigen slides (Panbio Inc., Sinnamon Park, Queensland, Australia) by using a Gentra Puregene kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Genomic DNA of other Rickettsia strains was also prepared from cultivated bacteria accord-ing to methods proposed by Furuya et al. ( 7). Our results showed that this novel assay could detect all 5 R. japonica strains and 1 R. heilongjiangensis strain used in this study. However, it could not detect R. rickettsii , R. prowazekii , or other Rickettsia strains. These results in- dicate that the combination of probes and primers in this study had high speci ﬁ city for the pathogenic R. japonica group. Nonspeci ﬁ c reactions were not observed when ge- nomic DNA from human or murine ﬁ broblasts was used in any of the assays (data not shown). The detection limits of this PCR were compared to those of conventional PCRs by using serially diluted ge-nomic DNA. The conventional PCRs, designated as Rj5-Rj10 and R1-R2 assays, were designed to detect the 17-kDa antigen gene of Rickettsia , by using a primer set of Rj5 (5 ′-CGCCATTCTACGTTACTACC-3 ′) and Rj10 (5′-ATTCTAAAAACCATATACTG-3 ′) (7) and R1 (5′-TCAATTCACAACTTGCCATT-3 ′) and R2 (5 ′- TTTACAAAATTCTAAAAACC-3 ′) (15), respectively. Since 1996, these assays have been used for molecular diagnosis of JSF in clinical laboratories in Japan. Recent studies have suggested that a TaqMan PCR assay may be as much as 100 × more sensitive than these assays (data not shown). Therefore, in our study, the TaqMan PCR was as-sumed to be much more sensitive than the conventional as-says that are known to show false-negative results, even for a patient with acute-stage JSF. We requested clinical samples to verify the validity of our assay. Eighteen DNA templates were extracted from blood clots collected from 18 patients in the acute stages of illness (male:female ratio 1:1; average age 64.1 years [range 27–88 years]); average number of days after onset Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1995 Figure.

Diagnostic Assay for Rickettsia japonica of fever 4.6 [range 2–7 days; Table 2]). These templates were reexamined by using our TaqMan PCR. Although the conventional assays could not detect the presence of any Rickettsia DNA, 9 of 18 samples displayed positive results with the TaqMan PCR (Table 2). The blood clot from the patient in whom Scrub typhus disease was previously diag-nosed was used as a negative control in this real-time PCR assay, resulted were not detected. Our TaqMan PCR is cur-rently available to clinical laboratories that need to rule out false-negative results in molecular diagnoses. Conclusions JSF is a threat to public health in Japan. Our results suggest that an R. japonica –speci ﬁ c 216-bp ORF may have been conserved throughout the R. japonica species and closely related Rickettsia spp. The newly developed real- time PCR system, which demonstrated a high level of sen-sitivity and speci ﬁ city, may be a useful tool for laboratory diagnosis.

Novel Lineage of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus , Hong Kong Luca Guardabassi, Margie O’Donoghue, Arshnee Moodley, Jeff Ho, and Maureen Boost To determine whether spa type of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in pigs belonged to sequence type (ST) 398, we analyzed nasal swabs from pig carcasses at Hong Kong markets in 2008. ST9 belonging to spa type t899 was found for 16/100 samples, which indicates that a distinct lineage has emerged in pigs. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has long been recognized as an important hospital pathogen and in recent years has emerged in the commu-nity. Increasing numbers of reports have concerned MRSA in animals. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has shown widespread dissemination of sequence type (ST) 398 among pigs in the Netherlands ( 1). This MRSA lineage has subse- quently been reported in several other countries and animal species. Compelling microbiologic and epidemiologic evi-dence indicates that persons living or working on farms, es-pecially pig farms, have an increased risk for colonization or infection with ST398 ( 2). In the present study, MRSA isolates obtained from slaughtered pigs in Hong Kong were characterized genotypically and compared with ST398. The Study Nasal swab specimens collected by using Transwabs (Medical Wire Ltd, Corsham, UK) were collected from 100 pig carcasses at 2 wet markets in Hong Kong on 5 separate days over a 7-week period in 2008. Cross-contamination was minimized by selecting carcasses with intact nasopha-ryngeal tracts and by instructing the butchers taking part in the project to avoid causing damage to the nares when cutting up the heads. The frontal section of each snout was cleaned with 75% alcohol before swabbing the nasal mu-cosa up to 8 cm into the nares. Nasal swabs were enriched in brain–heart infusion broth (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) with 7% NaCl at 37 oC for 48 h and then injected into man-nitol salt agar (Oxoid) supplemented with 6 μg/mL oxacil- lin, for 24 h. Presumptive S. aureus colonies were tested for heat-stable nuclease (DNase) and coagulase production, and isolates positive for both were con ﬁ rmed to the species level by latex agglutination (Staphaurex Plus, Murex Diag-nostics Ltd, Dartford, UK). Antimicrobial drug sensitivity testing was performed by using disk diffusion following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommenda-tions ( 3). Methicillin resistance was con ﬁ rmed by disk dif- fusion using cefoxitin (30 μg) and mecA PCR detection. All MRSA isolates were characterized by pulsed- ﬁ eld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) by using SmaI (4), staphylococcal chromosome cassette (SCC) mec typing ( 5), and spa typing (6) with Ridom StaphType 1.4.1 software (www.ridom.de/ staphtype). Two isolates representative of distinct PFGE patterns and SCC mec types were analyzed by MLST ( 7), and the remaining isolates were characterized by single-locus ( aroE ) sequencing. MRSA was isolated from 16 samples collected on 4 of the 5 sampling days. In contrast to ST398, which has the characteristic of being nontypeable by PFGE using SmaI (1,2), the 16 MRSA isolates were typeable. They displayed 6 PFGE patterns; 2 predominant types (A1 and B1) were as-sociated with SCC mec types IV and V, respectively (Table 1). Both PFGE types were ST9 according to MLST analy-sis. The 4 remaining patterns were either closely related to A1 (A2, A3, and A4) or possibly related to B1 (B2) accord-ing to the criteria of Tenover et al. ( 8). All isolates belonged to spa type t899 and harbored the ST9-associated aroE al- lele 3, which differs from that in ST398 (allele 35) by mul-tiple mutations. Porcine MRSA ST9 isolates were negative for Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes and resistant to a broader range of antimicrobial agents than that previously described for MRSA ST398 isolated from pigs in the Neth-erlands ( 1). Twelve isolates displayed a typical multiple resistance pattern, including resistance to chloramphenicol, ciproﬂ oxacin, clindamycin, cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, gentamicin, and tetracyline. The remaining 4 isolates were additionally resistant to fusidic acid (Table 1). All isolates were negative for Panton-Valentine leukocidin and suscep-tible to vancomycin and linezolid. A search of the scienti ﬁ c literature and the Internet for information about the frequency of S. aureus ST9 in hu- mans and animals indicated that ST9 is a clone of porcine origin. In 2005, Armand-Lefevre et al. ( 9) reported that ST9 was the most prevalent ST of methicillin-susceptible S. au- reus (MSSA) isolated from pig farmers and infected pigs in France but not from a control group of persons without occupational contact with pigs. In 2007, an erythromycin-resistant MSSA ST9 clone belonging to spa type 337 was found to be endemic on a farm in Denmark ( 10). A clini- cal ST9 isolate of porcine origin carrying the multidrug re-sistance gene cfr, associated with linezolid resistance, has DISPATCHES 1998 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Author af ﬁ liations: University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg C, Denmark (L.

Novel MRSA, Hong Kong recently been described ( 11). Six ST9 sequences have been submitted to the MLST database (http://www.mlst.net), in-cluding 5 for MSSA isolates from bloodstream infections in the United Kingdom and 1 for a MRSA isolate from the nose of a pig in China (ID2357). Single cases of human infection with MRSA ST9 t899 have been reported in the Netherlands ( 2) and in Guangzhou, China ( 12). Eighteen spa-type t899 isolates have been submitted to the Ridom SpaServer (http://spaserver2.ridom.de): 10 from Germany, 7 from the Netherlands, and 1 from Belgium. All submis-sions were recorded as MRSA, but unfortunately, the ori-gins of the isolates and the MLST types were not reported. Although MRSA t899 has been previously associated with ST398 isolates from pigs ( 13) and from participants at a conference on pig health ( 14), the repeat succession of this spa type is completely different from those of other ST398- related spa types and similar to those of spa types related to ST9 (Table 2). That the same spa type occurs in both ST9 and ST398 is surprising because the MLST allelic se-quences of these 2 S. aureus lineages are unrelated (Table 2). However, the occurrence of the same spa types in dis-tant lineages has been previously reported ( 15) and could have resulted from either convergent evolution or genetic recombination. Conclusions Our study of MRSA colonization of commercial pigs in Asia provides evidence that methicillin resistance has emerged in a porcine S. aureus lineage other than ST398. It appears that ST9 has achieved methicillin resistance through multiple acquisitions of SCC mec, as indicated by the recovery of distinct PFGE and SCC mec types. A com- bination of the results of literature and database searches indicates that ST9 is associated with pig farming and, al-though it is found infrequently, this ST has been isolated from infected persons worldwide. Several studies have previously investigated the preva- lence of MRSA nasal carriage in pigs sampled immediately after slaughter ( 2) or at the farm of origin (13). In our study, samples were collected at wet markets, because it not pos-sible to access pigs at the single slaughterhouse in Hong Kong or at the farm sites of origin because >90% of slaugh- Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 1999 Table 1.

ter pigs are raised in mainland China and delivered by train directly to the slaughterhouse in Hong Kong. Notably, the previously reported human infection in China with MRSA-ST9 occurred in Guangzhou, the province closest to Hong Kong, where most of the pigs originate. The colonization rate determined in our study represents the level of contam-ination immediately prior to sale of pig meat to consumers. Although pig heads are rarely available in European and North American markets, because these parts of the animal are generally centrally processed, homemade soup using the pig’s nose is commonly consumed in Hong Kong; this gastronomic tradition may increase the risk for zoonotic transmission of MRSA. Further epidemiologic studies are needed to determine the rates of colonization and infection with MRSA and MSSA ST9 both in personnel exposed to pigs and in the community.

Respiratory Infection in Institutions during Early Stages of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Canada Alex Marchand-Austin, David J. Farrell, Frances B. Jamieson, Nino Lombardi, Ernesto Lombos, Sunita Narang, Holy Akwar, Donald E. Low, and Jonathan B. Gubbay Outbreaks of respiratory infection in institutions in On- tario, Canada were studied from April 20 to June 12, 2009, during the early stages of the emergance of in ﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Despite widespread presence of inﬂ uenza in the general population, only 2 of 83 outbreaks evaluated by molecular methods were associated with pan-demic (H1N1) 2009. Respiratory infection outbreaks in institutions housing large numbers of residents create an ideal environ- ment for disease transmission ( 1). Patients in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) for the elderly are more susceptible to respiratory infections and have a higher risk for compli-cations ( 2,3). The Study We reviewed respiratory infection outbreaks regis- tered with the Public Health Laboratory (PHL), Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion dating back to October 2007 (Table 1). Molecular detection methods were used for a subset of outbreaks registered during October 1, 2008–April 19, 2009. After emergence of severe respira-tory illness clusters in Mexico in early April, intensi ﬁ ed tracking of respiratory infection outbreaks in Ontario was undertaken. Consequently, more information was available on outbreaks registered during the spring (April 20 to June 12, 2009); these data comprise the bulk of the study. Respiratory infection outbreaks in LTCFs were de- ﬁ ned as any of the following: 2 cases of acute respiratory tract illness, 1 of which was laboratory-con ﬁ rmed; 3 cases of acute respiratory tract illness within 48 hours in a geo-graphic area (e.g., unit, ﬂ oor); and >2 units having a case of acute respiratory illness within a 48-hour period. In ﬂ uenza- like-illness was de ﬁ ned as acute onset of respiratory illness with fever and cough with >1 of the following: sore throat, arthralgia, myalgia, or prostration. From April 20 through June 12, 2009, a total of 112 respiratory infection outbreaks were registered. Molecular testing was not used in 29 outbreaks (e.g., insuf ﬁ cient/in- appropriate sample). Most of the remaining 83 outbreaks submitted for molecular testing originated from LTCFs (91%); hospitals (2%), child care centers (2%), and psychi-atric care facilities (1%) comprised the remainder. Facility type was not known for 4% of outbreaks tested. Mean age of persons tested as part of an outbreak investigation was 82 years (SD 13.96 years) and median age was 85 years; 95% were >57 years of age. Testing on the 589 specimens received from 161 out- breaks registered from October 1, 2008 through June 12, 2009 was performed by real-time reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) for the in ﬂ uenza A virus matrix gene and the Luminex Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) (Luminex Mo-lecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) for other respiratory viruses. An etiologic agent was identi ﬁ ed in 89% of the 161 outbreaks tested by molecular methods. One-hundred-eleven (69%) were caused by 1 etiologic agent. Two and 3 different pathogens were identi ﬁ ed in 24 (15%) and 6 (4%) outbreaks, respectively. Four pathogens were identi-ﬁ ed in 2 (1%) outbreaks. No etiologic agent was identi ﬁ ed in 18 (11%) of the outbreaks tested by molecular methods, which includes 1 specimen in which the result was indeter-minate for coronavirus OC43. A wide range of causative etiologic agents were detected for outbreaks by the RVP assay (Table 2). Specimens from most patients were posi-tive for enterovirus/rhinovirus (114 patients) followed by metapneumovirus (85), parain ﬂ uenza virus type 3 (55), and human in ﬂ uenza virus A (H3) (41). No virus was identi ﬁ ed in 186 patients.

Co-infections were noted in 22 of the patients tested by the RVP assay. In 1 LTCF outbreak, 2 patients had co-in-fection of an untypeable in ﬂ uenza A and enterovirus/rhino- virus on testing by RVP. An in ﬂ uenza A real-time RT-PCR result was negative in both patients; 1 patient had a co-in-fection with respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus/rhinovirus. Co-infections with coronavirus subtypes 229E and NL63 were the most common, observed in 10 of the 22 patients (45%) infected with multiple pathogens. Isolates from 1 patient were positive for 3 viruses (coronavirus sub-types 229E and NL63 and enterovirus/rhinovirus). One of the 2 outbreaks identi ﬁ ed as caused by pandem- ic (H1N1) 2009 originated from a LTCF was not observed until June 3, 2009, six weeks into the evolving pandemic, despite widespread community prevalence. The second pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak, registered on June 11, 2009, originated from a hospital treating patients with in ﬂ u- enza-like illness. Seasonal in ﬂ uenza (H1N1 and H3N2) or pandemic (H1N1 2009) was detected in 2,966 (25.5%), and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in 2,203 (19%) of 11,612 persons tested at PHL for in ﬂ uenza A by real-time RT-PCR dur- ing April 20–June 12, 2009. Seasonal in ﬂ uenza A (H3N2) was only identi ﬁ ed in 273 specimens (11.0%) of the 2,476 inﬂ uenza A positive samples subtyped. However, it was the strain responsible for 15 (88%) of the typeable in ﬂ uenza A outbreaks at the same time. Seasonal in ﬂ uenza A (H1N1) was absent from institutional outbreaks and only detected in 41 (2%) of subtyped in ﬂ uenza A–positive samples from the general population. Persons with laboratory-con ﬁ rmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection tested at the PHL, Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, were younger than those tested as part of outbreak investigations. Mean and median ages were 21.5 and 16 years, respectively; only 10% were >46 years of age. Conclusions The number of respiratory infection outbreaks in insti- tutions submitted to PHL may re ﬂ ect disease impact caused by respiratory viruses during the in ﬂ uenza season. Respi- ratory viruses during the 2007–08 season may have been more active than those of the 2008–09 season because the number of outbreaks registered with PHL decreased from 1 year to the next. Declaration of pandemic status for the novel (H1N1) virus has not in ﬂ uenced the reporting of re- spiratory infection outbreaks from institutions in Ontario because submission rates for the corresponding period in 2007–08 and 2008–09 are similar. Variation would not be expected because reporting is required by Ontario law ( 4). Respiratory viruses detected in outbreaks in institu- tions re ﬂ ect those known to be major causes of acute respi- ratory disease in the community; prevalence varies based on geographic location, season, and detection methods (5–7). Free access to such institutions by members of the community (staff or visitors), in conjunction with commu-nal close quarters of residents, creates an ideal environment for propagation of viral respiratory outbreaks ( 8). Current guidelines for isolation during viral respiratory outbreaks are not tailored for the speci ﬁ c virus. As shown in this study, multiplex molecular testing makes it possible to identify the virus causing most LTCF respiratory infec-tion outbreaks. Infection control guidelines for a speci ﬁ c outbreak could be modi ﬁ ed based on the incubation period and duration of viral shedding for the identi ﬁ ed virus ( 9). The most commonly identi ﬁ ed virus in our study was enterovirus/rhinovirus.

Respiratory Infection and Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 rhinovirus can cause severe lower respiratory tract infec- tion, including death, as documented in several LTCF out-breaks ( 10,11 ). These data highlight the need for molecular capacity to diagnose rhinovirus infection because detection is otherwise limited to less sensitive viral culture systems. This review of outbreaks predominantly involving elderly persons in LTCFs highlights the sparing of older persons by pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Possible explanations include cross-protective antibodies from previous expo-sure to in ﬂ uenza A (H1N1) strains circulating before the antigenic shift of in ﬂ uenza A to subtype H2N2 in 1957 or minimal contact with those most likely to have imported the pandemic strain into Canada (young travelers) ( 12). In addition, older persons may have less contact with the age group (children 10–19 years of age), with most cases being in Ontario. Our ﬁ ndings support Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for vaccination with monovalent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. These guidelines have not placed older persons in a high priority group for vaccination because increased rates of hospitalization and severe disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 have not been observed ( 13,14 ). Investment in multiplex technolo- gies to investigate respiratory outbreaks in LTCFs shortens time for pathogen detection, helps guide infection control and vaccination policies, and can potentially save resources spent on other investigations.

Estimates of the Prevalence of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, United States, April–July 2009 Carrie Reed, Frederick J. Angulo, David L. Swerdlow, Marc Lipsitch, Martin I. Meltzer, Daniel Jernigan, and Lyn Finelli Through July 2009, a total of 43,677 laboratory-con- ﬁ rmed cases of in ﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were reported in the United States, which is likely a substantial underestimate of the true number. Correcting for under-as-certainment using a multiplier model, we estimate that 1.8 million–5.7 million cases occurred, including 9,000–21,000 hospitalizations. Human cases of in ﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed in the United States in April 2009 (1,2). By the end of July, >40,000 laboratory-con ﬁ rmed infections had been reported, representing only a fraction of total cases. Persons with in ﬂ uenza may not be included in reported counts for a variety of reasons, including the following: not all ill persons seek medical care and have a specimen collected, not all specimens are sent to a public health laboratory for con ﬁ rmatory testing with reverse tran- scription–PCR (RT-PCR; rapid point-of-care testing cannot differentiate pandemic [H1N1] 2009 from other strains), and not all specimens will give positive results because of the timing of collection or the quality of the specimen. To better estimate the prevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 during April–July 2009 in the United States, we created a simple multiplier model that adjusts for these sources of under-ascertainment. The Study Through July 23, 2009, a total of 43,677 laboratory- conﬁ rmed infections with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had been reported in the United States by the 50 states and the Dis-trict of Columbia, including 5,009 hospitalizations and 302 deaths. To estimate the total number of cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, we built a probabilistic multiplier model that adjusts the count of laboratory-con ﬁ rmed cases for each of the following steps: medical care seeking (A), speci-men collection (B), submission of specimens for con ﬁ rma- tion (C), laboratory detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (D), and reporting of con ﬁ rmed cases (E) (Figure). This approach has been used to calculate the underrecognized impact of foodborne illness in the United States ( 3). At each step, we identi ﬁ ed a range of proportions ob- served in prior published studies and recent surveys and investigations of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. These include 2 unpublished community surveys on in ﬂ uenza-like ill- ness (ILI) and health-seeking behavior, the 2007 Behav-ioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey conducted in 10 DISPATCHES 2004 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Author af ﬁ liations: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA (C.

Prevalence of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, United States states and repeated in the same states during May 2009, and ﬁ eld investigations conducted during early outbreaks of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Chicago and Delaware (on-line Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/2004-Techapp.pdf; [ 4]). We theorized that, given recommendations for testing, patients hospital-ized with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 would more likely have been tested and their cases reported than would outpatients. We therefore strati ﬁ ed our model between hospitalized and nonhospitalized cases (Figure). For hospitalized patients, we used larger estimates of the proportion of specimens collected, tested, and reported, which resulted in smaller multiplier values (Table 1). We also adjusted for the fact that early in the epidemic physicians and health depart-ments were encouraged to collect clinical specimens from all suspect case-patients with ILI and forward them for con-ﬁ rmatory testing with RT-PCR. By May 12, due to the in- creasing number of cases and the demands on public health laboratories, guidance for con ﬁ rmatory testing was revised to focus on hospitalized patients. We therefore used a lower estimate for the proportion of specimens collected from pa-tients with mild illness after that date, effectively increas- ing the multiplier for those patients (Table 1). Multipliers were calculated as the simple inverses of the proportions at each step. We accounted for variability and uncertainty in model parameters by using a probabi-listic (Monte Carlo) approach (built by using SAS version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). For each parameter in-cluded in the model, we used uniform probability distribu-tions that covered a range of minimum to maximum values, from which the model randomly sampled 10,000 iterations (online Technical Appendix). We generated median, upper, and lower 90% values for the number of total illnesses and hospitalizations.To further divide estimated cases into age groups, we applied the age distribution of con ﬁ rmed cases and hospi- talizations as reported to the US Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention through July 23, 2009 (online Tech-nical Appendix), and calculated overall and age-speci ﬁ c incidence of illness and hospitalization, based on the US Census monthly population estimates for May 2009. We did not have age-speci ﬁ c parameter estimates, and thus did not stratify by age group within the model. This approach may not fully capture differences in the probability of as-certainment by age. Using this approach, between April and July 2009, we estimate that the median multiplier of reported to es-timated cases was 79; that is, every reported case of pan-demic (H1N1) 2009 may represent 79 total cases, with a 90% probability range of 47–148, for a median estimate of 3.0 million (range 1.8–5.7 million) symptomatic cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the United States. Likewise, we estimate that every hospitalized case of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 that was reported may represent a median of 2.7 total hospitalized persons (90% range 1.9–4.3). This represents a median estimate of 14,000 (range 9,000–21,000) hospi-talizations (Table 2) and thus an estimated ratio of hos-pitalizations to total symptomatic cases of 0.45% (range 0.16%–1.2%). We also estimate that incidence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 over the ﬁ rst 4 months of the pandemic in the United States ranged from a median of 107/100,000 in persons >65 years of age, to 2,196/100,000 in persons 5–24 years of age (Table 2). The incidence of hospitalization was estimated to be highest in young children <5 years of age (median 13.0/100,000, 90% range 8.8–20.2).

Conclusions We demonstrate that the reported cases of laboratory conﬁ rmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 are likely a substantial underestimation of the total number of actual illnesses that occurred in the community during the spring of 2009. We estimate that through July 23, 2009, from 1.8 million to 5.7 million symptomatic cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 occurred in the United States, resulting in 9,000–21,000 hospitalizations. We did not estimate the number of deaths directly from our model, but among reports of laboratory-conﬁ rmed cases though July 23, the ratio of deaths to hos- pitalizations was 6%. When applying this fraction to the number of hospitalizations calculated from the model—that is, by assuming that deaths and hospitalizations are under-reported to the same extent—we obtain a median estimate of 800 deaths (90% range 550–1,300) during this same period. Because this assumption has several limitations (5), more sophisticated models are also being developed to better understand the severity of the US epidemic in the spring of 2009, including intensive care unit admissions and deaths ( 6). Our analysis involves several assumptions. Data for parameter estimates were collected in limited periods and areas and thus may not be fully representative of the entire United States. To account for some of this uncertainty, a range of values was included for each proportion. Addi-tional data from surveys of health-seeking behavior, physi-cian testing practices, and policies for con ﬁ rmatory testing at public health laboratories could help re ﬁ ne the param- eter estimates. In addition, parameters were obtained from studies of persons with ILI, de ﬁ ned as fever with cough or sore throat. Persons with milder illness may be less likely to seek care or be tested, and thus may not be fully captured in these estimates. Likewise, in some heavily affected ar-eas, the size of the outbreak quickly exceeded the capacity to ascertain and test case-patients. Thus, our results may reﬂ ect a conservative estimate of total cases. As pandemic (H1N1) 2009 continues to spread through the United States and the world, laboratory-con ﬁ rmed cases will continue to greatly underestimate the number of actual cases that occur. Surveillance for in ﬂ uenza does not tradi- tionally rely on complete case ascertainment, which would be impractical, but on focused case ascertainment with well-characterized surveillance systems and special stud-ies. Unfortunately, relying on laboratory-con ﬁ rmed cases limits the ability to understand the full impact and sever-ity of the epidemic, especially when severe cases are more likely to be recognized ( 5). This model provides a relatively quick and simple approach to estimate the human health impact of the epi-demic in advance of more rigorous analysis of surveillance and health care data that will be available over the next few years. Health systems and infrastructure may be un-prepared in the short-term if plans are based on a number of con ﬁ rmed cases that substantially underestimates the impact of the epidemic. We estimate that the total num-ber of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases in the United States during April–July 2009 may have been up to 140× greater than the reported number of laboratory con ﬁ rmed cases. A spreadsheet version of the model has been developed and is available online (www.cdc.gov/h1n1 ﬂ u/tools).

Mopeia Virus– related Arenavirus in Natal Multimammate Mice, Morogoro, Tanzania Stephan Günther, Guy Hoofd, Remi Charrel, Christina Röser, Beate Becker-Ziaja, Graham Lloyd, Christopher Sabuni, Ron Verhagen, Guido van der Groen, Jan Kennis, Abdul Katakweba, Robert Machang’u, Rhodes Makundi, and Herwig Leirs A serosurvey involving 2,520 small mammals from Tanzania identi ﬁ ed a hot spot of arenavirus circulation in Morogoro. Molecular screening detected a new arenavirus in Natal multimammate mice ( Mastomys natalensis) , Mo- rogoro virus, related to Mopeia virus. Only a small percent-age of mice carry Morogoro virus, although a large propor-tion shows speci ﬁ c antibodies. Arenaviruses are segmented negative-strand RNA vi- ruses. Their natural hosts are various rodent species. The virus family comprises several human pathogens caus-ing hemorrhagic fever, namely Machupo, Guanarito, Junin, Sabia, and Chapare viruses in South America, and Lassa and Lujo viruses in Africa ( 1–3). In addition, Africa har- bors arenaviruses that are not linked with human disease: Mobala, Ippy, Mopeia, and Kodoko viruses ( 4–7). We con- ducted a systematic search in wildlife in Tanzania to iden-tify new African arenaviruses. The Study During 1985 through 1989, a total of 2,520 small mam- mals were live-trapped in different regions of Tanzania. After species determination, they were measured and bled by orbital puncture. Serum samples were tested by indirect immuno ﬂ uorescent antibody (IFA) assay ( 8). Lassa virus was used as antigen due to its cross-reactivity with immune sera from animals infected with other arenaviruses ( 4,6). Clusters of seropositivity were found in Arvicanthis spp. rodents from the Iringa region (20%) and in Natal multi-mammate mice ( Mastomys natalensis ) from Arusha (18%) and Morogoro (17%) ( Table 1 ), which suggests that these animals are reservoirs of arenaviruses. Titers ranged from 16 to 512 and 16 to 4,096 in Arvicanthis spp. rodents and M. natalensis mice, respectively. Peak prevalence in M. natalensis mice was found on the campus of the Sokoine University in Morogoro (23.7% of 746 animals collected over several seasons). In 2004, M. natalensis mice were trapped in a mosaic of maize ﬁ elds and fallow grassland at the university campus in the city of Morogoro (6°50 ′34.9794′′S; 37°38′8.232′′E) to identify the virus. The animal voucher specimens were deposited at the Royal Museum of Central Africa, Ter-vuren, Belgium. RNA was prepared from 10 μL of rodent serum by using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA), and screening was performed by us-ing a pan–Old World arenavirus reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) speci ﬁ c for the large (L) gene ( 9). One of 96 serum samples was positive (no. 3017/2004) ( Table 2 ), and sequencing of the PCR fragment showed a new arenavirus sequence. The virus was isolated in Vero cells and called Morogoro virus (strain 3017/2004). For sequencing, the isolate was propagated in T75 ﬂ asks, virus particles in supernatant were pelleted by ultra- centrifugation, and RNA was isolated by using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit (QIAGEN). The entire 3.5-kb small (S) RNA segment was ampli ﬁ ed by RT-PCR as described previously (10). The 7-kb L RNA segment was ampli ﬁ ed in 2 fragments by using a long-range RT-PCR protocol and primers target-ing the conserved termini of L RNA and Morogoro virus–speciﬁ c primers designed on the basis of the sequence of the fragment detected by RT-PCR screening. By using the PCR products as a template, short overlapping fragments were ampli ﬁ ed and sequenced with a set of consensus primers for Old World arenaviruses, and S and L RNA sequences were assembled (GenBank accession nos. EU914103 and EU914104). (Sequences reported in this article have been submitted to GenBank and assigned the following accession numbers: full-length S and L RNA sequences of Morogoro virus, EU914103–04; partial L gene sequences of Morogoro virus, EU914107–22; cytochrome B gene of Morogoro vi-rus-positive Mastomys natalensis , EU914105–06.) Full-length amino acid sequences of glycoprotein precursor (GPC), nucleoprotein (NP), and L protein of Morogoro virus were aligned with published Old World arenavirus sequences and pairwise p distances were calcu-lated.

Mopeia Virus–related Arenavirus, Morogoro, Tanzania of Mopeia virus that were circulating in Mozambique ( 4) and Zimbabwe ( 5). A close relationship between both vi- ruses was also demonstrated by phylogenetic analysis us-ing GPC, NP, and L gene sequences ( Figure 1, panel D, and data not shown). Both viruses are sister taxa, sharing a common ancestor with Mobala virus. Although the distances between Morogoro and Mopeia virus in the amino acid sequence of GPC (12%), NP (12%–13%), and L gene (26%) were higher than intraspecies dif-ferences among known African arenaviruses (i.e., pairwise differences between strains of the same species; <11% in GPC and NP; <21% in L), they did not reach the level of interspecies distances (>20% in GPC and NP; >37% in L) (Figure 1, panels A–C ). Therefore, we currently consider Morogoro virus a subspecies of Mopeia virus rather than a new arenavirus species. This classi ﬁ cation is supported by the fact that both viruses share the same host. Sequenc-ing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of rodent liver samples positive for Morogoro virus con ﬁ rmed that its natural host is M. natalensis mice (GenBank accession nos. EU914105 and EU914106).An additional 303 ethanol-preserved liver samples and 63 serum samples were collected in 2004 and 2007, respec-tively. Liver tissue ( ≈3 mg) was homogenized by using a bead mill. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and RNA was isolated from the homogenate with the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). Testing by L gene RT-PCR ( 9) showed 16 positive liver and serum samples, which indicated a vi-rus prevalence in the M. natalensis population of ≈4% ( Ta- ble 2 ). PCR fragments were sequenced (GenBank acces- sion nos. EU914107–EU914122), and Morogoro virus was isolated in cell culture from all 4 PCR-positive serum sam-ples obtained in 2007. Morogoro virus–speci ﬁ c antibodies in serum samples from 2004 and 2007 were measured by IFA assay using Vero cells infected with Morogoro virus. The antibody prevalence was ≈50%, which compares quite well with the 23% prevalence determined in this area 20 years before. In some animals, virus and antibodies were detected ( Table 2 ).

opportunity to estimate the molecular clock rate for this virus. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed with the BEAST version 1.4.8 package (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk) (11) under the assumption of a relaxed lognormal molecu- lar clock and general time reversible (GTR) or Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) substitution model with gamma-dis-tributed substitution rate variation among sites ( Figure 2 and data not shown). Analysis was run for 2 million Mark-ov chain Monte Carlo steps, which yielded a reliable set of data as veri ﬁ ed with the TRACER program (http://tree.bio. ed.ac.uk/software/tracer). Based on GTR and HYK model, 3.2 × 10 –3 and 3.4 × 10–3 substitutions per site and year (95% interval of highest posterior density 1.1–6.6 × 10–3), respectively, were calculated.

Genetic distances and phylogenetic relationship among arenaviruses, including Morogoro virus. Amino acid sequence div ersity was calculated using p distance. Full-length glycoprotein precursor (GPC), nucleoprotein (NP), and large (L) gene amino acid se quences of the following arenaviruses were pairwise compared: Lassa virus (strains Josiah, NL, Z148, Macenta, AV, and CSF), Mobala Acar 3080, Morogoro 3017/2004, Mopeia virus (strains Mozambique and Zimbabwe), Ippy DakAnB188d, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (strains CH-5692, Marseille, Armstrong, and WE for all genes; Traub and Pasteur for GPC and NP only), Pirital, and Pichinde. Fr equency histograms of pairwise distances are shown for A) GPC gene; B) NP gene; and C) L gene. The ranges for intraspecies distances (i .e., pairwise differences between strains of the same virus species); distances between different African arenavirus species; betwee n African arenaviruses and LCMV; and between Old World and New World viruses are marked above the bars. Bars representing the distances between Morogoro virus and the most closely related viruses (Mopeia virus strains) are ﬁ lled in black. D) Phylogeny of Old World arenaviruses based on full-length L gene amino acid sequences. The tree was inferred by using the neighbor-joining method implemented in the MEGA software package (www.megasoftware.net). The New World arenaviruses Pirital and Pichinde were used as outgroups. Numbers represent bootstrap support (1,000 replications). Identical trees with respect to the phylogenetic position of Morogoro virus (shown in the box) were obtained with full-length GPC and NP amino acid sequences (not shown).

Mopeia Virus–related Arenavirus, Morogoro, Tanzania in the late 1980s. This work is being published now be- cause early attempts to substantiate the existence of the vi-rus failed. The identi ﬁ cation of the virus was facilitated by a recently developed pan–Old World arenavirus PCR ( 9) that also led to the discovery of new arenaviruses in ro-dents from West Africa ( 7). Only a small percentage of M. natalensis mice carry Morogoro virus, and a large propor- tion shows speci ﬁ c antibodies, which indicates that most animals clear the virus during life. Viruses and antibodies, which are presumbably directed to nucleocapsid proteins, also co-circulate, as seen in hantavirus infection in rodents (12). Detection of Morogoro virus in the liver is consistent with the organ tropism of Lassa virus in M. natalensis mice (13). In agreement with studies on Lassa virus strains, the largest genetic distance between Morogoro and Mopeia vi-rus was seen in L gene, which contains several highly vari-able regions ( 14). The clock rate estimate of 3 × 10 –3 for Morogoro virus L gene is in agreement with that of other RNA viruses ( 15), although it must be interpreted with caution, given that the difference in date between the samples is not large. The tree topology did not correlate with geographic or ecologic sampling data. The pathogenicity of Morogoro virus for humans is not known, though its phylogenetic clustering with African are-naviruses that are not linked with human disease ( 4–6) and the absence of hemorrhagic fever in the area suggest that it does not cause severe disease. Hospital-based investiga-tions are required to estimate the public health relevance of this virus.

Molecular Model of Prion Transmission to Humans Michael Jones, Darren Wight, Rona Barron, Martin Jeffrey, Jean Manson, Christopher Prowse, James W. Ironside, and Mark W. Head To assess interspecies barriers to transmission of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), we in-vestigated the ability of disease-associated prion proteins (PrP d) to initiate conversion of the human normal cellular form of prion protein of the 3 major PRNP polymorphic variants in vitro. Protein misfolding cyclic ampli ﬁ cation showed that conformation of PrPd partly determines host susceptibility. The agents responsible for the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are called prions. Although their precise biochemical composition is a matter of debate, they are known to occur in a series of strains, each with a characteristic disease phenotype and host range ( 1). A central event in neuropathogenesis of TSEs is conversion of the normal cellular form of the prion protein (PrP C) to the pathognomonic disease-associated isoform (PrPd) (2). In the absence of a known nucleic acid genome, it has been proposed that the strain-like properties of different TSE agents are encoded by distinct self-propagating conforma-tional variants (conformers) of PrP d (3). The best developed method available for typing these PrPd isoforms uses limited proteolysis and classi ﬁ cation of the protease-resistant prion protein (PrPres) in terms of the sizes of the nonglycosylated fragment(s) produced and the ratio of the 3 possible glyco-forms ( 3). If distinct conformers and glycotypes of PrP d are responsible for diversity of prion strains, then they would be expected to be able to impose these molecular charac-teristics onto PrP C of the same amino acid sequence (when transmitted or replicating within a species) and onto PrPC of a different primary sequence (when transmitted between species). In support of this theory, the agent responsible for the TSE of cattle, called bovine spongiform encephalopa-thy (BSE), the accepted cause of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans ( 4), has been shown to be trans-missible to at least 7 species ( 1), resulting in propagation of PrP d that retains the characteristic molecular signature of the original BSE prion strain ( 5–7). Current thinking favors a seeded polymerization mod- el for the conversion of PrPC into PrPd, which has led to the development of several cell-free in vitro conversion model systems ( 8). One such system is protein misfolding cyclic ampli ﬁ cation (PMCA) ( 9), in which small amounts of PrP d introduced (seeded) into substrate containing excess PrPC and other essential conversion cofactors can be ampli ﬁ ed to readily detectable levels by sequential cycles of sonica-tion and incubation. We have previously reported that the molecular characteristics, electrophoretic mobility, and glycoform ratio of the PrP res associated with the vCJD PrPd conformer were faithfully reproduced by PMCA ( 10). How- ever, the ef ﬁ ciency of ampli ﬁ cation achieved depended on the substrate’s prion protein gene codon 129 ( PRNP -129) genotype. The most ef ﬁ cient ampli ﬁ cation was achieved in a methionine homozygous ( PRNP -129MM) substrate; the least ef ﬁ cient, in a valine homozygous ( PRNP -129VV) substrate. To estimate the molecular component of trans-mission barriers for particular TSE agents between species, we used PMCA reactions to amplify PrP d associated with vCJD ( 10), bovine BSE ( 11), ovine scrapie ( 12), and exper- imental ovine BSE ( 13) and substrates prepared from hu- manized transgenic mouse brain tissue expressing each of the 3 main PRNP polymorphic variants found in Caucasian human populations ( PRNP -129MM, MV, and VV) ( 14). The Study We prepared seed and substrate homogenates as 10% (wt/vol) homogenates in PMCA conversion buffer ( 10). Seed homogenates were diluted into substrate homoge-nates so that all PMCA reactions contained equivalent amounts of PrP d based on the PrPres levels in each seed ho- mogenate. PrPres levels were determined by Western blot titration that used monoclonal antibody (MAb) 6H4 after limited proteinase K digestion. The reaction mixes were split into 2 aliquots; 1 aliquot was stored immediately at –80°C (−PMCA), and the other was subjected to 48 cycles of PMCA (+PMCA) ( 10). To assess the degree of PrP d am- pliﬁ cation achieved from each seed in each substrate, the samples −/+ PMCA were subjected to limited proteinase K digestion, and PrPres was detected by Western blotting with MAb 6H4 (which recognizes human, bovine, and ovine PrP) and MAb 3F4 (which selectively recognizes only hu-man PrP and would therefore speci ﬁ cally identify PrP res formed from human PrPC). Using MAb 6H4 to probe Western blots, we noted ampli ﬁ cation of vCJD, bovine BSE, and ovine BSE PrPres in the PRNP -129MM substrate (Figure 1, panel A, top) but not in the PRNP -129VV substrate (Figure 1, panel A, bottom).

blots by densitometry showed that the degree of ampli ﬁ - cation of vCJD PrPres was considerably greater than that of bovine or ovine BSE in the PRNP -129MM substrate (Figure 2, panel A). A more sensitive and discriminatory Western blot conducted by using MAb 3F4 con ﬁ rmed ef- ﬁ cient ampli ﬁ cation of vCJD, bovine BSE, and ovine BSE PrP res in the PRNP -129MM substrate (Figure 1, panel B, top), weaker ampli ﬁ cation in the PRNP -129MV substrate (Figure 1, panel B, middle), and little, if any, ampli ﬁ ca- tion in the PRNP -129VV substrate (Figure 1, panel B, bottom). In all substrates, the ampli ﬁ ed PrPres retained the electrophoretic mobility and glycoform ratio associated with BSE-related PrP res. No ampli ﬁ cation of ovine scrapie PrPres was evident after PMCA in any of the PRNP human- ized transgenic mouse brain substrates (Figure 1, panels A, B). The difference between ovine scrapie and ovine BSE in ability to seed ampli ﬁ cation in PRNP -129MM substrate was a robust phenomenon evident in brain samples from 3 different ARQ/ARQ sheep with each disease (Figure 2, panel B). However, failure of the ovine scrapie seed to am-plify was not caused by a general lack of competence to do so or by inappropriate ampli ﬁ cation conditions because robust ampli ﬁ cation of ovine scrapie PrP res was evident af- ter PMCA in a substrate prepared from normal ARQ/ARQ sheep brain (Figure 2, panel C).

Molecular Model of Prion Transmission to Humans PRNP polymorphic status of PrPC and PrPd and the PrPd conformers involved (Table). Regardless of the seed PrP amino acid sequence, the PrP d conformers associated with bovine BSE, ovine BSE, and human vCJD were ampli ﬁ ed in the humanized mouse substrate and displayed similar PRNP -129 genotype preferences ( PRNP -129MM > PRNP - 129MV > PRNP -129VV). In contrast, the PrP d conformer associated with the ovine scrapie strain, although sharing the same PrP amino acid sequence as the PrP d in ovine BSE, could not be ampli ﬁ ed in any of the PRNP humanized mouse substrates but could be ampli ﬁ ed in a sheep brain substrate. These observations are consistent with confor-mation of a TSE agent’s PrP d (rather than solely its amino acid sequence) having a role in determining the susceptibil-ity of a host’s PrP C to conversion. They similarly suggest that these molecular factors could in turn have a powerful inﬂ uence on disease susceptibility and incubation time.To date, all clinical cases of vCJD have occurred in persons with the PRNP -129MM genotype, as might be pre- dicted from the ef ﬁ ciency of ampli ﬁ cation of BSE-related PrP d shown here. Extrapolating from these results, one would predict that the next genotypic group most likely to show susceptibility to the BSE agent would be heterozy-gous (MV) at codon 129 of the PRNP gene, as previously suggested from the corresponding in vivo transmission studies ( 14). In the wake of BSE epidemics in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, enhanced surveillance has identi ﬁ ed appar- ently new TSEs ( 15), raising concerns regarding animal and human health. PMCA with suitable substrate sources could provide a rapid way to estimate the molecular com-ponent of transmission barriers for particular TSE agents between species, including humans. These estimates could thus indicate whether, like classical scrapie, the agents rep- Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2015 Figure 2.

Dobrava-Belgrade Virus Spillover Infections, Germany Mathias Schlegel,1 Boris Klempa,1 Brita Auste, Margrit Bemmann, Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, Thomas Büchner, Martin H. Groschup, Markus Meier, Anne Balkema-Buschmann, Hinrich Zoller, Detlev H. Krüger, and Rainer G. Ulrich We present the molecular identi ﬁ cation of Apodemus agrarius (striped ﬁ eld mouse) as reservoir host of the Do- brava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) lineage DOBV-Aa in 3 fed-eral states of Germany. Phylogenetic analyses provided evidence for multiple spillover of DOBV-Aa to A. ﬂ avicollis, a crucial prerequisite for host switch and genetic reassort-ment. European hantaviruses are emerging viruses that can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) of differing severities. Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) is a hantavirus that appears in 3 distinct lineages hosted by different Apodemus species. The DOBV-Af lineage as- sociated with the yellow-necked mouse ( A. ﬂ avicollis ) has caused serious HFRS in southeast Europe with a case-fa-tality rate <12% ( 1,2). Human infections with Caucasian wood mouse ( A. ponticus )–associated DOBV-Ap have re- sulted in more moderate than severe HFRS in the south-ern part of European Russia ( 3). Mild-to-moderate human DOBV disease in central and eastern Europe has been con-nected with infection by DOBV-Aa lineage carried by the striped ﬁ eld mouse ( A. agrarius ) (3–5). Other A. agarius – associated strains, found in Estonia and called Saaremaa virus, have been proposed to form a distinct hantavirus species ( 6). In Germany, human DOBV cases with mild to moderate clinical outcomes have been detected by sero-logic investigations ( 4,7) but only 1 short DOBV-Aa small (S) segment sequence derived from a patient in northern Germany has been identi ﬁ ed (8). The natural host and the geographic distribution of DOBV in its reservoir host has remained unknown in Germany. The Study During 2002 through 2008, a total of 366 Apodemus mice were trapped at 7 different sites in Germany (Fig-ure 1). Serologic screening of transudates collected from these rodents by using an in-house DOBV immunoglobu-lin (Ig) G-ELISA, with a yeast-expressed nucleocapsid protein of DOBV-Af as antigen, identi ﬁ ed 16 reactive and 5 equivocal samples of 114 A. agrarius trapped at 7 trap- ping sites in 3 federal states of Germany (Figure 1; online Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/2017-Techapp.pdf). Additionally, of 237 A. ﬂ avicollis mice, 1 equivocal sample and 4 DOBV-reactive samples were detected at 4 trapping sites (Figure 1; online Technical Appendix). In contrast, of 15 wood mice ( A. sylvaticus ) originating from 3 trapping sites, none were found to be DOBV-seroreactive. A subsequent focus-re-duction neutralization test showed a higher endpoint titer with DOBV-Aa than DOBV-Af (online Technical Appen-dix) for 6 of the 8 investigated transudates independently, whether originating from A. agrarius or A. ﬂ avicollis . An initial screening by a large (L) segment–speci ﬁ c nested reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) ( 3) of 67 lung samples, representing all seroreactive (n = 20) and equivo-cal (n = 6) as well as 36 selected seronegative and 5 sero-logically not-analyzed animals, showed a 390-nt ampli ﬁ ca- tion product for 21 samples representing 16 seroreactive, 4 seronegative, and 1 serologically not-investigated animals (online Technical Appendix). To enable a comparison with the only available DOBV sequence from Germany (H169), an S segment portion of 559 nt was ampli ﬁ ed by RT-PCR from 11 lung tissues (online Technical Appendix). In the phylogenetic analyses, all sequences from Germany formed 1 well-supported (PUZZLE [www.tree-puzzle.de]) and bootstrap support values >90%) monophyletic group consisting of 2 clusters. The ﬁ rst cluster contained S seg- ment sequences from district Güstrow (trapping sites Pe1 and Pe3), Lüneburg (trapping site WG), Nordvorpommern (trapping site H), and the previously published DOBV sequence from an HFRS patient from northern Germa-ny (H169; [ 8]; Figure 2, panel A). A second cluster was formed by S segment sequences originating from districts Ostprignitz-Ruppin (trapping sites Ka, To) and Demmin (trapping site K/A1). Notably, the A. ﬂ avicollis –derived se- quences from sites Pe1, H, Ka, and K/A1 clustered together or were identical with A. agrarius –derived sequences from the same or neighboring trapping sites, suggesting multiple Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2017 Author af ﬁ liations: Friedrich-Loef ﬂ er-Institut–Institute for Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany (M.

spillover infections (Figure 2, panel A; online Technical Appendix). The sequences from Germany share a common ances- tor with the DOBV-Aa sequences originating from Slova-kia and Russia. Together, they form a monophyletic group (DOBV-Aa lineage) that is clearly separated from A. ﬂ av- icollis –borne (DOBV-Af) and A. ponticus –borne (DOBV- Ap) sequences and from A. agrarius –borne Saaremaa virus sequences. Subsequent analysis of nucleotide sequences of the entire nucleocapsid (N) protein– and glycoprotein pre-cursor (GPC)–encoding regions con ﬁ rmed these ﬁ ndings (Figure 2, panel B; online Technical Appendix). A pairwise comparison between nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the complete N and GPC open reading frames from the novel German DOBV strains showed divergences of 1.5%–8.8% (0.3%–1.4%) and 2.1%–8.3% (0.8%–1.8%), respec-tively (online Technical Appendix Table 2). The highest identity values on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence level (91.2%–91.7% and 99%–99.7%) were found for an S segment sequence from Denmark (Lolland/1403; GenBank accession no. AJ616854; online Technical Appendix). The nucleotide and amino acid sequence divergence to other DOBV sequences was much higher, reaching 10.1%–14.3% (1%–3.3%) and 12.6%–20.7% (2.9%–9.4%), respectively. Morphologic species determination for all DOBV- seroreactive and RT-PCR–positive rodents was con ﬁ rmed by a mitochondrial cytochrome b gene-speci ﬁ c PCR ( 9,10), sequence determination, and comparison with available GenBank sequences from A. agrarius and A. ﬂ avicollis (online Technical Appendix). Conclusions Based on a large panel of the entire N- and GPC-en- coding DOBV sequences, we report direct molecular evi-dence that DOBV in Germany is represented by a genetic lineage associated with A. agrarius (DOBV-Aa). In con- trast, we found no evidence for the occurrence of DOBV-Af in A. ﬂ avicollis or other Apodemus species from Germany. Consistent with the geographic distribution of A. agrarius (11) and the report of human DOBV disease exclusively in northern and northeastern Germany, this ﬁ nding may conﬁ rm DOBV-Aa as the sole causative agent of DOBV infections in Germany ( 4; Robert Koch-Institut, SurvStat, www.rki.de). Previously A. agrarius –associated Saaremaa virus was experimentally shown to be able to infect A. agrari- us and A. ﬂ avicollis mice ( 12). We report multiple natu- ral spillover infections of A. ﬂ avicollis by a DOBV strain originally hosted by A. agrarius . The observed spillover infections represent a crucial prerequisite for genetic reas-sortment. This observation is in contrast to other reports from Slovenia and Slovakia where, although A. agrarius and A. ﬂ avicollis are occurring sympatrically, A. ﬂ avicollis DISPATCHES 2018 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 Figure 1.

For each trapping site, the rate of seroreactive A. agrarius mice is given as a circle (seroreactive and equivocal samples in black, negative samples in white) and with the numbers of seroreactive and equivocal samples/negative samples. At sites Pe1, H, K/A1, and Ka, 1 seroreactive A. ﬂ avicollis mouse was detected in each location (marked with stars). At site Pe1, 1 equivocal sample was found by the DOBV immunoglobulin (Ig) G ELISA. In addition to Apodemus mice, 138 rodents of other species, including 116 bank voles ( Myodes glareolus ), were trapped during the same period at sites Pe1, Pe3, K/A1, Ka, and To, but none of the 136 rodents with available transudates reacted in the DOBV IgG ELISA. Transudates with an optical density (OD) value below the lower cutoff (average of the OD values determined for 2 parallel tests of a negative Apodemus spp. serum control; average 0.041) were regarded as negative. Samples with an OD value above the upper cutoff (2-fold of the lower cutoff; average 0.082) were regarded as positive. Samples showing OD values between the lower and upper cutoffs were regarded as equivocal.

Dobrava-Belgrade Virus, Germany is exclusively carrying the DOBV-Af and A. agrarius the DOBV-Aa lineage ( 4,13). In contrast to our observations, single DOBV-Af spillover infections of A. sylvaticus and Mus musculus have been reported previously ( 14). The phylogenetic analyses demonstrated 2 well-sepa- rated clusters within the DOBV-Aa lineage. These rodent-derived DOBV sequences in Germany represent a major contribution to the DOBV genomics and phylogenetics. Future investigations should help to identify speci ﬁ c fea- tures of these DOBV-Aa strains resulting in its frequent spillover to A. ﬂ avicollis and to prove a putative adapta- tion of DOBV-Aa on A. ﬂ avicollis after spillover, as well as possible reassortment processes.Acknowledgments We kindly acknowledge the support of the various partners in the network “Rodent-borne pathogens,” additional collabora-tors from different parts of Germany, and Dörte Kaufmann, Dan-iel Balkema, and Heike Lerch.

Wild Felids as Hosts for Human Plague, Western United States Sarah N. Bevins, Jeff A. Tracey, Sam P. Franklin, Virginia L. Schmit, Martha L. MacMillan, Kenneth L. Gage, Martin E. Schriefer, Kenneth A. Logan, Linda L. Sweanor, Mat W. Alldredge, Caroline Krumm, Walter M. Boyce, Winston Vickers, Seth P.D. Riley, Lisa M. Lyren, Erin E. Boydston, Robert N. Fisher, Melody E. Roelke, Mo Salman, Kevin R. Crooks, and Sue VandeWoude Plague seroprevalence was estimated in populations of pumas and bobcats in the western United States. High levels of exposure in plague-endemic regions indicate the need to consider the ecology and pathobiology of plague in nondomestic felid hosts to better understand the role of these species in disease persistence and transmission. Zoonotic pathogens account for ≈60% of emerging dis- eases ( 1,2). Yersinia pestis , a vector-borne bacterium and the causative agent of plague in mammals, is 1 such emergent pathogen ( 3). Plague is maintained among rodent hosts and their ﬂ eas; however, spillover into accidental hosts can result in severe illness and death, as well as geo-graphic spread of the disease ( 4). Domestic cats are a major source of human plague in- fections in the United States ( 5), putting veterinary work- ers and pet owners at risk for Y. pestis infections. During 1924–2006, a total of 13 human cases of primary pneu-monic plague were documented in the United States, and >5 were associated with felids (D. Wong, pers. comm.). Twelve cases of plague transmission from nondomestic carnivores to humans have been documented ( 5–7), includ-ing a fatal case of human pneumonic plague in 2007 that resulted from direct contact with an infected puma ( Puma concolor ) (8). Despite the known association of felids with human plague, the prevalence of Y. pestis infection in non- domestic cats remains relatively unknown. Pumas and bobcats ( Lynx rufus ) are 2 of the most widespread felids in North American, with pumas having the greatest range of any wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere ( 9). Both species inhabit large ter- ritories and travel great distances during dispersal ( 9,10). These highly mobile animals may periodically reintroduce Y. pestis –positive ﬂ eas to distant regions, especially during epizootics ( 11). Consequently, carnivore-aided ﬂ ea disper- sal could play an important role in the spread and persis-tence of plague during interepizootic periods. We examined plague exposure in populations of bob- cats and pumas in California and Colorado. This gave us an opportunity to evaluate Y. pestis seroprevalence in multiple difﬁ cult-to-sample, plague-susceptible felid species across a wide geographic area. The Study We collected samples from 119 pumas and 212 bob- cats (Table 1) in 3 locations in southern California and 2 locations in western and north-central Colorado (Fig-ure) from autumn 2002 through summer 2008. Seventy-seven of these bobcat samples consisted of thoracic ﬂ uid collected postmortem from hunter-killed animals. Eight puma samples collected in the 1980s served as historical reference for puma samples from the Colorado Western Slope (i.e., area west of the Continental Divide). Animals were captured, sampled, and released with permission of cooperating agencies after approval by animal care and use committees. Samples were processed according to protocol ( 12). Thoracic ﬂ uid samples were immunoblotted onto ni- trocellulose membranes (immuno-blot polyvinylidene ﬂ uoride membranes; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and probed with goat-anti-cat-phosphatase labeled antibody to verify the presence of immunoglobulin. Reacted mem-branes were rinsed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, once in Milli-Q (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and were then exposed to a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (alkaline-phosphatase chromogen) substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithers-burg, MD, USA). Samples were classi ﬁ ed by comparing staining intensity to positive (bobcat/domestic cat serum) and negative controls (water and goat serum). Serum and thoracic ﬂ uid samples were analyzed for Y. pestis antibody using a hemagglutination assay according to a standard protocol ( 13). Positive samples were evalu- ated according to Chu ( 13). If a limited amount of sample was available, serum was diluted 1:4 and considered posi- Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2021 Author af ﬁ liations: Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colora- do, USA (S.N.

tive if titers were >32. Larger serum samples were not di- luted, and a reading >16 was considered positive ( 13). Data were analyzed by using a logistic link function and binary error, with antibody presence (positive vs. nega-tive) as the outcome variable (SAS version 9.1; SAS, Cary, NC, USA). Estimates used maximum likelihood. Degrees of freedom were calculated by using a Kenward-Roger ad-justment. Categorical factors included location, species, age, sex, and capture season. Animals captured in the fall (September–November) and in Ventura County were not plague positive and were omitted. All factors were treated as ﬁ xed variables, including location, because of previously reported differences in regional seroprevalence rates. A total of 76 of 77 thoracic ﬂ uid samples had immu- noglobulin present, as assessed by visual comparison of immunoblot staining, and were included in Y. pestis anti- body analysis. Interactions were not signi ﬁ cant and were omitted. Mean Y. pestis seroprevalence for pumas and bobcats across all locations was 17.7% (95% con ﬁ dence interval [CI] 13.6%–21.8%). However, considerable vari-ability existed across locations (Front Range, Colorado, mean = 21.1 [95% CI 8.23–44.75]; Orange County, Cal-ifornia, mean = 1.23 [95% CI 0.13–10.01]; San Diego/Riverside counties, California, mean = 6.58 [95% CI 1.52–24.33]; Ventura County, California, mean = 0 [NA]; Western Slope, Colorado, mean = 46.03 [95% CI 24.37–69.29]). Species and sex were not signi ﬁ cant predictors of plague exposure; however, animal age, geographic loca-tion, and capture season were signi ﬁ cant (Table 2). Adult animals (>2 years of age) and animals from the Colorado Western Slope were more likely to be seropositive (Table 1). Sixty-three percent (5/8) of historical puma samples from the Western Slope had detectable plague antibodies, similar to the seroprevalence rate of contemporary puma samples from this region (46.03%).

Wild Felids as Hosts for Human Plague role, and spring-captured animals were more likely to be seropositive (Tables 1 and 2). Colorado sample sites showed 51 (38%) positive of 135 animals tested. Seroprevalence rates in the Colorado sample areas were 21% (Front Range) and 46% (Western Slope) respectively, a higher proportion than expected giv-en the severe disease seen in plague infections in some do-mestic cats ( 3). California sample sites had limited plague seroreactivity, with only 4 (2.2%) of 181 animals positive for plague exposure. The Colorado Western Slope is near the Four Corners region (i.e., contiguous boundaries of southwestern Colo-rado, northwestern New Mexico, northeastern Arizona, and southeastern Utah). During 1957–2004, a total of 419 hu-man plague cases were documented in the United States, of which 83% were from this region ( 14). The complex dy- namics governing high plague incidence in this region are not fully understood despite extensive research but most likely involve climate, mammalian reservoirs, vector spe-cies, and habitat ecotypes ( 4,7,14). Conclusions Plague dynamics often are characterized by epizootics, resulting in interannual variation in infection rates among plague hosts; however, seroprevalence of 8 puma samples collected in the 1980s mirrored contemporary samples col-lected since 2002 and may indicate high levels of sustained plague activity in the area in this species. Seroprevalence rates were similar across multiple sample years. Vector-borne disease often is highly seasonal because of annual shifts in vector activities and abundance ( 4); however, sea- sonal patterns based on serologic data must be interpreted with caution because of long-term antibody persistence in some recaptured animals (S.N. Bevins, unpub. data). Puma and bobcat data from this study suggest expo- sure followed by recovery. All animals were outwardly healthy. Deaths caused by plague have been documented in wild felids ( 8,9,15), and the potential for plague expo- sure remains a concern for ﬁ eld biologists, veterinarians, hunters, and skinners. Field biosafety guidelines have been developed in conjunction with Colorado State University’s Biosafety Of ﬁ ce as a result of these ﬁ ndings. Recommen- dations include wearing disposable gloves, long pants, and long-sleeved shirts when handling anesthetized animals and using an N95-rated mask when conducting necropsies or handling deceased animals. Outside of human infections, plague could constitute a problem for felid conservation in areas of high plague activity ( 1,15). Results suggest large numbers of Y. pestis –exposed pumas and bobcats. Regular serosurveys that document seroreactivity increases above an original baseline could indicate epizootic activity in felids and other plague hosts. High regional seroprevalence indicate these animals may be involved in the persistence and transmission of Y. pes- tis. This and the documented transmission of plague from nondomestic carnivores to humans ( 6–8) emphasize the need to better understand the role of wild felids in plague dynamics.

Transplacental Transmission of Bluetongue Virus 8 in Cattle, UK Karin E. Darpel, Carrie A. Batten, Eva Veronesi, Susanna Williamson, Peter Anderson, Mike Dennison, Stuart Clifford, Ciaran Smith, Lucy Philips, Cornelia Bidewell, Katarzyna Bachanek-Bankowska, Anna Sanders, Abid Bin-Tarif, Anthony J. Wilson, Simon Gubbins, Peter P.C. Mertens, Chris A. Oura, and Philip S. Mellor To determine whether transplacental transmission could explain overwintering of bluetongue virus in the United Kingdom, we studied calves born to dams naturally infected during pregnancy in 2007–08. Approximately 33% were in-fected transplacentally; some had compromised health. In all infected calves, viral load decreased after birth; no evi-dence of persistent infection was found. Bluetongue virus (BTV) is generally transmitted be- tween ruminant hosts by Culicoides biting midges, and infection may result in the disease called bluetongue. In 2006, a strain of BTV-8 caused the ﬁ rst outbreak of bluetongue in northern Europe ( 1). Although adult Culi- coides midges are absent from this region during winter for long enough to interrupt normal transmission, BTV-8 survived the winters of 2006–07 and 2007–08. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the overwintering of BTV, one of which is transplacen-tal transmission ( 2). Tissue-attenuated strains of BTV are sometimes capable of crossing the placenta and infecting fetuses in utero ( 3), and transplacental infection has been reported from the ﬁ eld after use of live attenuated vaccines (4). However, many wild-type strains of BTV failed to cross the placental barrier when cows were infected dur-ing pregnancy ( 5). Additionally, although a few studies have reported experimental transplacental infection with wild-type strains, these studies did not recover infectious virus from live offspring (although many ﬁ eld strains do not grow in tissue culture) and suggested that fetal infec-tion often resulted in deformation, stillbirth, or abortion (6,7). Collectively, this information led to the assumption that only viruses passaged in tissue culture had the potential to overwinter by transplacental transmission ( 8). However, in 2008, nonlethal transplacental transmission of BTV-8 was detected in Northern Ireland ( 9). To examine the oc- currence, rate, and consequences of transplacental BTV-8 transmission in the United Kingdom, we studied calves born to dams naturally infected with BTV-8 during preg-nancy. The Study After obtaining owners’ permission, we sampled calves born to previously infected dams during the vec-tor-free period of December 20, 2007 to March 15, 2008. Farmers were also asked to report any births, abortions, or stillbirths from BTV-infected dams outside the vector-free period. Blood samples from live calves were taken as soon as possible after birth (usually within 4 days) and tested by using a real-time reverse transcription–PCR (rRT-PCR) (10) and the Pourquier c-ELISA kit (IDEXX, Chalfont St. Peter, UK). When possible, information about the health of the calf was obtained, dams were sampled alongside their calves, and placenta samples were collected. Calves with positive BTV RNA results were resampled at 2–3 week intervals. In total, 61 calves were tested and 21 (in-cluding 1 set of twins) had detectable levels of BTV RNA in their blood or organs (online Appendix Table, avail-able from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/2025-appT.htm). The transplacental transmission rate was 33% (95% conﬁ dence interval 22%–47%). All calves except calf 21 and calf X, each of which had not consumed colostrum before sampling, had antibodies against BTV. Calf 21 was also negative for BTV RNA, but calf X showed the highest viral load in the blood (online Appendix Table). Virus isolation in KC cells ( 11) was at- tempted for all calf blood samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) <29, but virus was isolated from calf X only. Viral RNA load in all calves tested declined over time, and al-most all calves were rRT-PCR negative by the end of the study (Table). When the calves were ﬁ rst sampled, 52 dams were also tested. The RNA load in the calves always exceeded that of their dams, and 7 of the 20 dams giving birth to BTV-positive calves had no detectable viremia. Of the 21 BTV RNA–positive calves, 5 had compro- mised health. Calves Y, X, and 33 were born weak and died within hours, days, and weeks after birth, respectively, and calves 13 and 29 exhibited dummy calf syndrome ( 12).

negative PCRs for bovine viral diarrhea virus (S.W., pers. comm.). Although calf X died of colisepticemia, this illness probably resulted from the calf’s weakness and inability to consume colostrum. No infectious cause for the early post-natal death of calf Y, other than bluetongue, was identi ﬁ ed; pathologic ﬁ ndings for calves 13 and 29 are described else- where (S.W. et al., unpub. data). Calf 27, which had nega-tive BTV test results, was born with hypermobility of the fetlock joints, unilateral carpal valgus, and arthrogryposis. All other calves were reported to be healthy. Time windows for possible in utero infection of each calf were calculated according to the BTV testing history of the dam and the birth date of the calf (Figure). These win-dows were used to investigate effect of stage of gestation on the probability of transplacental transmission. To account for uncertainty in the date of infection, we used Bayes-ian methods (online Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/2025-Techapp.pdf). The probability of transplacental transmission increased with the time of gestation during which the dam became infected (β 1 0.033; 95% credibility interval 0.014–0.063). Conclusions This detailed ﬁ eld study, which combines data on BTV infection in cows with data on transplacentally acquired infection in their offspring, demonstrates that the BTV-8 strain circulating in northern Europe can cross the bovine placenta in a high proportion (33%) of cases and infect calves when dams are infected during pregnancy. A simi-lar study in continental Europe suggested a rate of ≈10% (13). However, because the transmission season was longer in some of these countries, many seropositive dams could have been infected before pregnancy, leading to underesti-mation of the probability of transplacental infection. In our study, we tested only calves from dams infected between August and December 2007 and known to be pregnant at the time of infection. Furthermore, analysis of our data sug-gests that transplacental transmission is more likely when infection occurs later in gestation; indeed, most of the dams in this study would have been in the second or third ges-tation trimester when infected (Figure), which may have increased our estimated rate over that found in continental Europe. Transplacental transmission is of particular concern for policy makers because it may result in the birth of immune-tolerant, persistent carriers, as has happened with bovine viral diarrhea virus ( 14). In our study, all BTV-pos- itive calves other than X and Y were tested after they had received colostrum and, hence, maternal antibodies. The presence of BTV antibodies in calf Y suggests that fetal an-tibody formed in response to in utero infection, yet calf X had no detectable antibodies against BTV despite strongly positive rRT-PCR results. Calf X was infected late in gesta-tion (Figure), when it should have been capable of mount-ing its own antibody response ( 15). Antibody-negative PCR-positive calves have been reported elsewhere ( 13). Follow-up testing is needed to assess whether such calves remain persistently infected; however, because calf X died a few days after birth, follow-up testing was not possible. RNA declined in all retested calves (Table); most were PCR-negative by the end of the study, including dummy calf 13. Therefore, our results do not suggest that transpla-DISPATCHES 2026 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Table.

Transplacental Transmission of BTV-8, Cattle cental infection with BTV-8 results in subclinical, persis- tent carriers. Nonetheless, the ﬁ nding that some calves may be born with deformaties after the virus has cleared may lead to underestimation of the economic effects of BTV; calf 27, which was born with limb deformities to a BTV positive dam, could be such a case. Live virus has been successfully isolated from only 4 transpacentally infected calves (including calf X described in this study), all of which received either no maternal co-lostrum or only pooled colostrum ( 9,13). Further work is needed to assess whether infectious virus can be isolated from healthy transplacentally infected calves that have colostrum-derived maternal antibodies, because infectious virus needs to be present if transplacental infection is to play a major role in overwintering. In conclusion, future emerging BTV strains should be considered to have the po-tential for transplacental transmission until investigations show otherwise.

Echinococcus vogeli Infection in a Hunter, French Guiana Jenny Knapp,1 Mircea Chirica, Christine Simonnet, Frederic Grenouillet, Jean-Mathieu Bart, Yasuhito Sako, Sonoyo Itoh, Minoru Nakao, Akira Ito,1 and Laurence Millon1 Echinococcus vogeli infection in a hunter from the rain forest of French Guiana was con ﬁ rmed by imaging and mi- tochondrial DNA sequence analysis. Serologic examination showed typical patterns for both alveolar and cystic echi-nococcosis. Polycystic echinococcis caused by E. vogeli may be an emerging parasitic disease in Central and South America. Echinococcosis is one of the most lethal helminthic zoonoses worldwide. The 4 species of the genus Echi- nococcus are E. granulosus sensu lato, now including 5 independent species ( 1,2), which causes cystic echinococ- cosis (CE); E. multilocularis, which causes alveolar echi- nococcosis; E. vogeli, which causes polycystic echinococ- cosis (PE); and E. oligarthrus, which causes the recently described unicystic echinococcosis ( 3–6). Among these species, E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli are neotropical species localized exclusively in Central and South America ( 5,6). Only 3 cases of E. oligarthrus infection have been reported in the literature (1 from Brazil, 1 from Venezuela, and 1 from Surinam); 168 E. vogeli cases have been reported in 12 countries in Central and South America. To date, there have been no reports of neotropical echinococcosis in Bo-livia, Paraguay, Guyana, or French Guiana ( 5,6). E. granu- losus occurs sympatrically in South America, whereas E. multilocularis does not occur there at all ( 3,5). As both E. vogeli and E. oligarthrus have primarily sylvatic life cycles and the diagnosis is usually based on histopathologic ex-amination of resected lesions, the number of human cases might be underestimated because of the small number of patients who receive surgical treatment ( 5,6). We report a case of human infection from French Guiana caused by E. vogeli . The Study In April 2006, a 72-year-old man was admitted to a lo- cal hospital in Cayenne, French Guiana, for abdominal pain and a palpable epigastric mass. The patient hunted jaguars in the rain forest of French Guiana and owned dogs. He had no history of travel outside French Guiana. An exploratory laparotomy performed in June 2006 showed a hard, whitish liver tumor, deemed unresectable. Histopathologic exami-nation of a biopsied sample of the tumor showed multilocu-lar cysts. Albendazole treatment was started immediately after surgery. In January 2007, the patient was referred to the Department of General, Endocrine, and Digestive Sur-gery at the Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France. Computed tomography showed a multilocular hypoattenuating cystic mass in the left side of the liver, in ﬁ ltrating the left glis- sonian pedicle up to the hepatic hilum (Figure 1, Panel A). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-de ﬁ ned, thin- walled, multilocular cystic mass (11 × 10 × 12 cm) involv- ing segments II, III, and IV of the liver (Figure 1, Panel B) and multiple intraperitoneal cysts. The cysts appeared mark-edly hyperintense on T2-weighted images, hypo-intense on T1-weighted images, and showed slight enhancement of the septa after gadolinium injection. The patient underwent a left hepatectomy and resection of intraperitoneal cysts. Analysis of the operative specimen showed multiple large and small parasite hooks, with mean lengths of 32.7 μm ± 6 μm and 42.7 μm ± 0.7 μm, respectively (Figure 2). Two serum samples from the patient (one obtained in May 2006, the other in December 2006) were analyzed by several immunologic techniques; all indicated infec-tion with Echinococcus spp. Commercial ELISAs using E. granulosus antigens (Bordier Af ﬁ nity Products, Lausanne, Switzerland, and Biotrin International, Antony, France) and the E. multilocularis -speci ﬁ c Em2 plus-ELISA (Bor- dier Af ﬁ nity Products, Switzerland) were both strongly positive. Con ﬁ rmative Western blots (LD Bio Products, Lyon, France) showed a shadow at 16–18 kDa, which is characteristic for E. granulosus infection, on both samples. Additional Western blots carried out at Asahikawa Medi-cal College (Asahikawa, Japan) using recombinant anti-gens (RecAgB8/1, more speci ﬁ c for E. granulosus , and RecEm18, more speci ﬁ c for E. multilocularis ; 7,8) also showed strong responses. On the basis of serologic patterns obtained with recombinant antigens, with no knowledge of the patient’s clinical background, travel history, or images of the lesion, E. granulosus infection with many multiple cysts, advanced E. multilocularis , or advanced E. vogeli in- fection was suspected (7,9).

Molecular identi ﬁ cation was carried out with reference to the GenBank database by using a highly polymorphic DNA target ( 10). DNA from the liver lesion was extract- ed by using the High Pure PCR Preparation Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). A part of the cox1 mitochondrial gene was sequenced by using the E. vogeli –speci ﬁ c primer set ( cox1 _F: 5′-TTAATTTTGCCTGGGTTTGG-3 ′ and cox1 _R: 5′-ACGACCCATATGATCCCAAA-3 ′). A se- quence of 492 bp was obtained with the ABI 310 sequenc-er (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and was compared with Echinococcus spp. sequences published in the GenBank database (online Appendix Table, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/2029-appT.htm). The sequences were aligned by using BioEdit 7.0.9.0 ( 11), and sequence identity matrix was generated based on the percentage of base pairs in common between species. The cox1 sequence was found to be 100% identical to E. vogeli species originating from Colombia (GenBank accession no. AB208546; 2) and was clearly distinguishable from all other Echinococcus species (online Appendix Table). On the basis of imaging showing numerous multiple cysts, serologic examination showing typical patterns for both alveolar and cystic echinococcosis, and the life history of the patient, the diagnosis of polycystic echinococcosis caused by E. vogeli could have been made before surgi- cal intervention ( 5,7,9). The immunoblot showing a strong antibody response to recombinant AgB suggested a large volume of cyst ﬂ uid. Therefore, the immunoblot showing strong responses to both recombinant Em18 and AgB may be a typical pattern for advanced E. vogeli infection (data not shown). Because few studies using serologic analysis on human E. vogeli cases have been published, it would be useful to study antibody responses using recombinant an-tigens with large numbers of such patients and to compare the results with patterns observed with alveolar and cystic echinococcosis ( 7,9). After surgery, identi ﬁ cation of parasite hooks was car- ried out. The hooks showed the characteristic shape of E.

E. vogeli Infection, French Guiana vogeli and thus differed from E. granulosus (mean lengths of large hooks 25.9–35 μm, and small hooks 22.6–27.8 μm) and E. oligarthrus (30.5–33.4 μm and 25.4–27.3 μm, respectively) ( 12,13). E. granulosus and E. oligarthrus also occur in South America. The presence of hooks indicated that the parasite lesion was fertile in our patient, as shown in ≈50% of cases ( 5). Based on mitochondrial DNA analy- sis, the parasite identi ﬁ cation was con ﬁ rmed as E. vogeli . Further molecular studies on the haplotypes of this species may give information concerning the genetic diversity and circulation of the parasite in South America ( 14). Albendazole has been used for medical management of alveolar and advanced cystic echinococcosis ( 3). Several instances of its ef ﬁ cacy on polycystic echinococcosis have been reported, but given the primacy of surgical manage-ment of these infections, albendazole will probably remain an additional treatment ( 5). Neotropical echinococcosis cases are rare compared with alveolar and cystic echinococcosis ( 5). This rarity is probably because of the sylvatic life cycle of these species. However, because domestic dogs have been introduced to areas where E. vogeli is present in its natural cycle, the po- tential for transmission of the parasites from dogs to hu-mans by close contact exists. The at-risk population mainly lives in rural areas and has limited access to medical ser-vices, which strongly suggests that many infected persons cannot receive adequate treatment for this underestimated disease. Conclusions We report an autochthonous case of E. vogeli infec- tion documented in French Guiana. Further investigations are needed to improve the serologic diagnosis of this in-fection and to de ﬁ ne its typical serologic pattern compared with echinococcosis. Healthcare providers need to be alert to the existence of neotropical echinococcosis and should consider the possibility of its emergence in Central and South America. Although rare, this disease is still lethal in untreated cases.

Recombination in Vaccine and Circulating Strains of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Viruses Bin Li, Liurong Fang, Zuofei Xu, Suyan Liu, Jianfeng Gao, Yunbo Jiang, Huanchun Chen, and Shaobo Xiao Em2007, a porcine reproductive and respiratory syn- drome virus (PRRSV) variant with a unique 68 aa deletion in Nsp2, was recently isolated in China. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses indicated that Em2007 is a natural recombinant between a vaccine strain of PRRSV and circulating virus. We also tested its pathogenicity in piglets. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is now considered one of the most economically impor- tant diseases in countries with intensive swine industries. The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is a member of the family Arteriviridae (1). The genome of PRRSV is ≈15 kb and encodes 9 open reading frames (ORFs). Two distinct genotypes of PRRSV share only ≈60% nucleotide identity and are represented by the North American pro-totype VR-2332 and the European prototype Lelystad vi-rus (LV) ( 2). Sequence differences have also been found among isolates of the same genotype, particularly in the Nsp2 regions within ORF1a, and ORF5 ( 3). Mutation and genetic recombination play an important role in the evolu-tion of PRRSV ( 4–6). Since May 2006, porcine high fever syndrome, caused by highly pathogenic PRRSV and characterized by high fe-ver and high death rates in pigs of all ages, has emerged in China and affected >20 million pigs ( 7–9). Genomic analy- sis showed that nearly all of the emerging highly patho-genic PRRSVs isolated from this outbreak share a unique discontinuous deletion of 30 aa in Nsp2 ( 7–10 ). However, a novel PRRSV variant, with a 68 aa deletion in Nsp2, emerged in central China in 2007. We report the unique genetic characteristics of this novel variant and its patho-genicity in piglets.The Study At the end of 2007, a smaller cDNA fragment than the expected size was observed from a fetal piglet when a diag-nostic reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to amplify the unique genetic marker of the highly patho-genic PRRSV, indicating that a novel PRRSV variant was found. This strain, designated Em2007, was subsequently isolated and the full-length genomic sequence was deter-mined. The genome of Em2007 was 15,272 bp, including the poly(A) tail (GenBank accession no. EU262603), and shared 87.6% and 57.9% sequence identity with VR-2332 and LV, respectively, indicating that Em2007 belongs to the North American genotype. The Nsp2 gene of Em2007 was 2,736 bp and encoded 912 aa, with a unique continu-ous deletion of 68 aa at positions 499–566, relative to strain VR-2332 (online Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/2032-Techapp.pdf). This unique deletion is substantially different from previous PRRSV isolates with deletions in Nsp2 ( 3,7–11 ). To establish the genetic relationships of Em2007, we constructed phylogenetic trees using the neighbor-joining method based on the full-length genome. Results showed that Em2007 formed a minor branch, which was located in the middle of 2 clusters represented by CH-1a (the ﬁ rst PRRSV isolated in China in 1996) and JXA1 (the highly pathogenic PRRSV isolated in China in 2006), respectively (data not shown). We also compared the sequence identity of individual Em2007 ORFs with representative PRRSV isolates and found that all ORFs have highest identity (>92%) with CH-1R (an attenuated vaccine strain used in China), except for Nsp2 (80.2%). Because recombinations have been reported in PRRSV in previous studies ( 6), we speculated that Em2007 is a mosaic. To test our hypothesis, we used 3 approaches to detect possible recombination events within Em2007. First, SimPlot, which calculates and plots the percent identity of a query sequence against a panel of reference sequences in sliding windows ( 12), was performed using Em2007 as a query. Based on a set of complete genome sequences, including 56 Chinese PRRSVs isolated during 1996-2008, three representative North American strains (VR-2332, MN184B, and P129), and 2 attenuated vac-cine strains (RespPRRS, CH-1R) (the origin of all strains is listed in the Table), the SimPlot graph clearly showed that Em2007 was generally closer to CH-1R than to any other strain. However, there were 3 narrow zones show-ing disproportionately low levels of similarity between the 2 strains compared to other regions (Figure 1, panel A). Notably, the 3 narrow zones of Em2007 had high levels of similarity with WUH1 (a highly pathogenic PRRSV, isolated in Wuhan, China in 2006). These results indicated that Em2007 is a possible recombinant and CH-1R and WUH1 are 2 putative parental-like strains.

Recombination in Strains of PRRSV was further analyzed by Bootscan, a program for the detec- tion of recombination events, and the Genetic Algorithm for Recombination Detection (GARD) ( 13). Six potential recombination breakpoints, with maximal χ 2, were found (Figure 1, panel B), indicating that 3 recombination events have taken place within Em2007. Two recombination frag-ments (1,457–2,312 and 3,245–4,584) are located in Nsp2; the third (8,195–9,168) is located in Nsp9. Phylogenetic trees of nucleotide sequences of each re- combination region de ﬁ ned by GARD, including ﬂ anking regions, were further reconstructed by the neighbor-joining method. A large discrepancy (p<0.001, by Shimodaira-Hasegawa test) between phylogenetic trees inferred for each recombination region constitutes powerful evidence for recombination (online Technical Appendix). In addi-tion, a retrospective survey found that the fetal piglet from which Em2007 was isolated was from a farm in Wuhan, China, and CH-1R was used on this farm to control PRRS, indicating the potential for recombination between CH-1R and WUH1. This evidence further supported the possibility that Em2007 is a natural recombinant between CH-1R and WUH1. To test the virulence of Em2007, 40-day-old PRRSV- free piglets (9 piglets in each group) were inoculated in-tramuscularly with 10 0 mean tissue cultures infectious doses/2 mL of Em2007, CH-1a, and WUH1, respectively. Control piglets were inoculated with Dulbecco minimal essential medium. Clinical signs and rectal temperature were recorded daily. Two piglets from each group were euthanized and necropsied at 7 and 10 days postinocula-tion, and organs including lung, brain, spleen, kidney, liver, intestines, and lymph nodes were collected for viral load analyses and histopathologic examinations. The remaining 5 piglets in each group were observed for 21 days to evalu-ate death rates. Results showed that piglets inoculated with CH-1a experienced only temporary fever and mild respiratory symptoms. Obvious clinical signs, including inappetence, lethargy, high and continuous fever, red discolorations in the body, and blue ears were observed in piglets inoculated Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2033 Table.

with WUH1 (Figure 2, panel A). Furthermore, severe in- terstitial pneumonia (online Technical Appendix) and non-suppurative encephalitis cases were also observed 7 and 10 days postinoculation. Four of 5 piglets died within 21 days after inoculation (Figure 2, panel B). Piglets inoculated with Em2007 also showed similar clinical signs to those seen in the WUH1 group. However, the interstitial pneumonia and nonsuppurative encephalitis were mild and no deaths occurred throughout the experimental period in Em2007 group. The results of viremia and viral load also indicated that Em2007 was more mild than WUH1, but of substan-tially higher virulence than CH-1a (data not shown).Conclusions Em2007, a PRRSV variant with a unique continuous deletion of 68 aa in Nsp2, was isolated in China. This vari-ant is a natural recombinant between an attenuated PRRSV vaccine strain CH-1R and a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain, WUH1. Animal experiments demonstrated that while Em2007 has higher virulence than CH-1a, the paren-tal strain of CH-1R, it is attenuated relative to WUH1. Previous studies have shown that genetic recombina- tion occurs between attenuated vaccine strains of PRRSV grown together in culture ( 14). This study demonstrates for the ﬁ rst time that natural recombination can occur between vaccine and ﬁ eld strains, suggesting that live vaccines have the capacity to shape PRRSV evolution by homologous re-combination with circulating virus.

Two piglets from each group were euthanized and necropsied at 7 and 10 days postinoculation (dpi) for viral load analyses and histopathologic examinations. The remaining 5 piglets in each group were used to evaluate rate of death. Mean rectal temperature (A) and survival rate (B) of each group were recorded for 21 dpi.

Molecular Epidemiology of Glanders, Pakistan Heidie Hornstra, Talima Pearson, Shalamar Georgia, Andrew Liguori, Julia Dale, Erin Price, Matthew O’Neill, David DeShazer, Ghulam Muhammad, Muhammad Saqib, Abeera Naureen, and Paul Keim We collected epidemiologic and molecular data from Burkholderia mallei isolates from equines in Punjab, Pak- istan from 1999 through 2007. We show that recent out-breaks are genetically distinct from available whole ge-nome sequences and that these genotypes are persistent and ubiquitous in Punjab, probably because of human-mediated movement of equines. Glanders is an equine disease that was recognized by Hippocrates and Aristotle ( 1). It is caused by the bac- terium Burkholderia mallei , an obligate pathogen of horses, donkeys, and mules (Equidae), with occasional infections in felines, canines, and humans ( 2,3). Strict regulation of equines has reduced the range of this once globally dis-tributed disease to a few endemic foci in South and Cen-tral America, the Middle East, and parts of Africa and Asia (2,4). This emerging disease has only recently regained attention following the listing of B. mallei as a Category B agent by the US Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention ( 2). Although outbreaks are common in regions of disease endemicity, much of what is known about the ecology and natural population dynamics of B. mallei relies on indirect evidence and expert opinion, with little to no knowledge concerning its genetic diversity ( 2,3). We ge- netically characterized 15 samples of B. mallei from recent outbreaks in Pakistan to provide additional knowledge of how this disease of antiquity is transmitted throughout en-demic regions today.The Study We obtained clinical samples and background infor- mation from 15 glanderous equids in Punjab, Pakistan from 1999 through 2007 (Table; online Appendix Table, avail-able from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/2036-appT.htm). Research on equine subjects was approved by the Synopsis Scrutiny Committee and Animal Ethics Commit-tee, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Agricul-ture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. Samples were plated on brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar with 4% glycerol and incubated for 24–30 hours at 37°C. Individual colonies were inocu-lated into BHI broth containing 4% glycerol and were in-cubated with shaking for 36 h at 37°C. An aliquot of broth (1.5 mL) was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Ge-nomic DNA was extracted from the resulting pellets using standard digestion buffer and phenol-chloroform extraction protocols ( 6). For genotyping, we screened 23 loci (online Appendix Table) from a previously established 32-marker multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analy-sis system designed for B. pseudomallei and B. mallei (7). In silico genotyping of the same loci was also performed for 10 whole genome sequences (WGS) of B. mallei (8; online Appendix Table). VNTR markers have higher mu-tation rates than other genetic markers, which make them inappropriate for determining deep levels of evolutionary relatedness. VNTRs, however, are appropriate for 1) dis-crimination between closely related isolates, 2) determi-nation of the degree of relatedness among isolates, and 3) discernment of population structure on a spatial scale (7,9,10 ). This utility is especially important for B. mallei because it is a recently emerged clone of B. pseudomal- lei and has been shown to be genetically monomorphic with typing methods such as multilocus sequence typing (11). To compare the genetic diversity of our Punjab iso- lates to that of sequenced strains, we performed a phylo-genetic analysis on the 23 loci using the neighbor-joining algorithm in PAUP* 4.0b ( 9). To determine the genetic relationships among the Punjab population itself, we per-formed the same analysis using only the Punjab isolates and polymorphic loci (n = 15 loci). Combined analysis of the Punjab isolates and WGS showed that the Punjab isolates are phylogenetically dis-tinct from WGS (Figure 1). This ﬁ nding was also demon- strated in the values for average pairwise distance (APD), where the APD among Punjab isolates is 2 × lower than the APD calculated for either the entire phylogeny or the WGS alone (Figure 1). Therefore, the Punjab isolates represent only a small amount of the genetic diversity demonstrat-ed in this pathogen. Phylogenetic analysis of the Punjab isolates alone placed 14 of the 15 samples into 3 distinct clades with 1 sample standing alone (Figure 2). Most samples (9/15) belong to clade A, whose isolates are both DISPATCHES 2036 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Author af ﬁ liations: Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA (H.

Molecular Epidemiology of Glanders, Pakistan temporally and geographically diverse, suggesting that this lineage is ecologically established in Punjab. Because of the limited sample size, many of the pat- terns observed from these data may result from sampling bias. However, even a limited amount of genotypic data can be useful in formulating hypotheses regarding the dis-persal of B. mallei . For example, the presence of samples from Faisalabad in each clade suggests that this district may be a center of diversity in the province (Figure 2) but this does not indicate a lesser degree of diversity in other districts where fewer samples were collected. The diversity seen in the district of Faisalabad may re- sult from either 1) the industrial nature of Faisalabad or 2) from high endemism of B. mallei in the region. Currently, the district has ≈10,000 horses and mules and >44,000 don- keys, plus other transient equines ( 12). Many equines move through and work in the city, potentially introducing strains from surrounding regions. Because horses and mules can be positive but asymptomatic for glanders ( 13), many hosts are available to maintain strains throughout the region. Communal stables and water troughs are common through-out the district and B. mallei has been isolated from these water troughs (A. Naureen, unpub. data). Furthermore, B. mallei can remain viable in contaminated stables for up to 6 weeks ( 14) and in sterile tap water for up to 4 weeks ( 15), which provides an environment for establishment and re-tention of B. mallei populations in Faisalabad. Combining phylogenetic with epidemiologic data re- veals how B. mallei disseminates throughout a region. For example, epidemiologic data suggests that 2 horses from a farm in the district of Sargodha (PRL3 and PRL4) contract-ed glanders while at a polo club in the Lahore district. This is supported by VNTR data, as these 2 isolates clustered phylogenetically with one of the samples obtained from an outbreak that occurred at the same polo club 3 months prior (groups 5 and 6, Table). Furthermore, at the time of the PRL3 and PRL4 infections, a co-resident mule with no previous travel history (PRL44) was negative for glanders, making it unlikely that these horses acquired glanders from their farm. This mule was positive for glanders ≈1.5 years later, and the isolate obtained from its infection clustered phylogenetically with the samples from the polo club and Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2037 Figure 1. Unrooted neighbor-joining tree based on 23 variable number tandem repeat loci demonstrating that the Punjab isolates (black text and PRL-20) are genetically distinct from and less diverse than available whole genome sequences (WGS, red text) ( 7). Statistical supports for branches based on 1,000 bootstrap iterations are shown. Sample PRL-20 is shown in red text because it is also available as a whole genome sequence; therefore, it was used in all 3 situations where an average pairwise distance (APD) was calculated. Among 10 WGS, the average pairwise distance was 0.607; between 10 WGS and Punjab isolates, average pairwise distance was 0.627; and among 15 Punjab isolates, average pairwise distance was 0.312. These results indicate that the Punjab isolates are more closely related to each other than to the sequenced strains because the APD among Punjab isolates is 2 × lower than the APD calculated in the other 2 situations.

Sargodha horses. Therefore, we hypothesize that the in- fected horses either directly transferred the disease to the mule or they contaminated a source on the farm which sub-sequently led to the mule’s infection. Environmental sam-pling would be required to identify the original infection source for the horses and subsequent transmission route to the mule. Nevertheless, this case shows a strain that was transferred a distance of 168 km, demonstrating that hu-man-mediated movement of equines can in ﬂ uence the dis- tribution of B. mallei genotypes. This case also suggests that a strain can persist for ≈1.5 years. Other cases in the province demonstrate that infections either stem from similar strains or are caused by multiple strains. For example, samples that were placed in the same epidemiologic group cluster together phylogenetically (groups 1, 2, and 4; Table), indicating communal infections similar to the cases described above. In contrast, epidemio- logic group 5 (PRL19 and PRL20) was separated into 2 distinct clades (Figure 2), indicating that this outbreak was caused by multiple strains. Therefore, it should not be as-sumed that an outbreak of glanders is always caused by a single strain. Conclusions Our study suggests that numerous lineages of Burk- holderia mallei are present in Punjab, Pakistan, and that these lineages persist across geographic space and time. Despite this, these isolates appear to be genetically dis-tinct from other studied strains. The economics and use of equines likely contribute to the persistence of glanders in this region because modern methods for control of this disease (monitoring and euthanasia) are not viable options.

In December 2005, the 2 horses on the Sargodha farm tested positive for glanders after being housed together during the winter. A mule (PRL44) that was also present at the Sargodha farm tested negative for glanders at this time. Approximately 2 years later, the same mule tested positive for glanders after reports of 6 months’ standing nasal discharge.

Molecular Epidemiology of Glanders, Pakistan Therefore, other solutions to curbing the spread of glanders need to be identi ﬁ ed. We suggest that a focus on ﬁ nding methods to improve the sanitary conditions of communal water troughs and stables may lead to a practical solution for disease reduction and containment. Finally, our study demonstrates the utility of VNTRs paired with extensive epidemiologic data for analyzing the distribution of B. mal- lei genotypes throughout endemic regions.

Aleutian Mink Disease Virus and Humans Jørgen R. Jepsen, Francesco d’Amore, Ulrik Baandrup, Michael Roost Clausen, Elisabeth Gottschalck, and Bent Aasted Reports of a possible relationship between Aleutian mink disease parvovirus (AMDV) and human infection are rare. However, 2 mink farmers with vascular disease and microangiopathy similar to that in mink with Aleutian disease were found to have AMDV-speci ﬁ c antibodies and AMDV DNA. These ﬁ ndings raise the suspicion that AMDV may play a role in human disease. Autonomous parvoviruses, such as Aleutian mink dis- ease virus (AMDV), cause a broad spectrum of dis- eases in animals and man. Acute disease manifests itself as a lytic infection of rapidly dividing cells; chronic dis-ease re ﬂ ects a restricted or abortive infection of speci ﬁ c cell types ( 1). Aleutian disease (AD) is known to produce clinical signs in mink and ferrets only ( 2,3), although other mammals have reportedly been antibody positive. In adult mink, AD is a persistent, slowly progressive AMDV infection in which a dysregulated immune system and a postinfectious antibody response cause an immune complex–mediated vasculitis ( 2). Perivascular and glomer- ular immune complexes ( 2,4,5) can cause membranoprolif- erative glomerulonephritis ( 6) and segmental or circumfer- ential arteritis ( 4) with mononuclear in ﬁ ltration, ﬁ brinoid necrosis and deposits, and increased intimal cellularity. Mononuclear cells may surround the vessel, and connec-tive tissue proliferation and necrosis in the tunica elastica media narrow the lumen ( 7). In mink kits, AD causes an acute cytopathic infection of alveolar cells, which leads to respiratory distress and death ( 8). Reports of a possible relationship between AMDV and human infection are rare ( 9). Histopathologic features like those in AMDV-infected mink have been described for 2 patients in the early 1960s ( 10). Exposed laboratory work- ers have had persistent anti-AMDV antibodies for up to 18 months; however, injection of their antibody-positive blood into Aleutian mink caused neither lesions nor AMDV-anti- body production ( 11). In vitro studies have demonstrated a permissive infection (production of infectious progeny) of human macrophages with the Utah I strain of AMDV ( 12). We report ﬁ nding anti-AMDV antibodies and AMDV ge- nome in tissue from 2 mink farmers with relevant virus ex-posure and clinical disease similar to that in mink with AD. The Study We examined AMDV antibody from each of the 2 patients by countercurrent and line electrophoresis ( 13). AMDV DNA was identi ﬁ ed by standard and nested PCR. DNA was extracted from lymph nodes (patient 1) and from peripheral blood and bone marrow (patient 2) before ampli-ﬁ cation with AMDV-speci ﬁ c primers. AMDV DNA was identi ﬁ ed by 2 different sets of primers in the standard PCR (5–600 bp) and with 2 complete different internal primers in the nested PCR (200 bp). PCR products were cloned, and some clones were sequenced to con ﬁ rm the presence of AMDV DNA. All PCR reactions were done with ap-propriate controls. Patient 1 was a mink farmer who had been exposed to AMDV-infected mink for 10 years. When he was 22 years of age, toe ulceration and claudication developed. Arteriography showed bilateral occlusions of several lower limb arteries and associated development of a col-lateral network of vessels. At the age of 25, he underwent embolectomy, and the removed tissue showed vessel wall inﬂ ammation with a granulomatous appearance but no necrotizing lesions or epitheloid or eosinophilic in ﬁ ltra- tion. Over the next 10 years, despite surgical attempts to revascularize and treatment with anticoagulant drugs, his condition deteriorated: his renal, mesenteric, and axillary arteries became stenosed, and his right leg was amputated. Antibodies to AMDV were found in his serum at the end of these 10 years and at 2 subsequent measurements after 1 additional year. An abdominal aortic biopsy showed ad-ventitial lymphoplasmacytic cell in ﬁ ltration and minimal atherosclerosis (Figure 1). A lymph node biopsy sample showed modest reactive changes and T-zone hyperpla-sia, and AMDV DNA was identi ﬁ ed in the sample. At 35 years of age, the patient had a positive serologic result for anti-AMDV antibodies and severe claudication. Sub-sequent testing 1 and 2 years later showed negative results for AMDV antibodies and AMDV genome. The patient died in 1999, at 40 years of age, at which time his clinical condition resembled that of bilateral pneumonia. No spe-ciﬁ c infectious agent was identi ﬁ ed. Postmortem exami- nation showed periarterial collagen deposits, adventitial focal mononuclear accumulations, neutrophil in ﬁ ltration in the media, ﬁ brosis-related hyperplasia, lipid deposi- tion and calci ﬁ cations of the intima, and microabscesses within intraluminal thrombotic material.DISPATCHES 2040 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Author af ﬁ liations: Hospital of South-Western Denmark, Esbjerg, Denmark (J.R.

Aleutian Mink Disease Virus and Humans Patient 2 was also a mink farmer. He had been exposed to AMDV since the age of 20. At 54 years of age, 2 years after an extensive outbreak of AMDV among his mink, he was hospitalized for chronic glomerulonephritis. A renal biopsy sample showed endocapillary and mesangial prolif-erative glomerulonephritis with abundant focal semilunes (Figure 2, panel A). Immuno ﬂ uorescence showed anti- immunoglobulin M and anti-C3 antibodies localized to the renal capillaries. Electron microscopy showed organized ﬁ brillar deposits of stacked microtubules of ≈20 nm (Fig- ure 2, panel B), consistent with ﬁ brillary glomerulonephri- tis (14), an idiopathic condition characterized by polyclonal immune deposits with restricted gamma isotypes. No se-roimmunologic information was available for the patient at this time. Immunosuppression improved his renal function, and he remained stable while receiving continuous immu-nosuppressive medication. Eight years later, patient 2 was readmitted to the hospi- tal for diarrhea, vomiting, pyrexia, asthenia, and confusion. Cerebrospinal ﬂ uid contained high levels of protein and pleocytosis, but no speci ﬁ c infectious agent could be iso- lated from the cerebrospinal ﬂ uid or blood. Magnetic reso- nance imaging showed an increased meningeal signal over both cerebral hemispheres. Subsequent investigations re-peatedly demonstrated anti-AMDV antibodies and AMDV DNA in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Serum was still positive for AMDV antibodies 2 years later. Despite treat-ment with antimicrobial drugs, the patient further deterio-rated and died in 2004, at age 63, after an additional year of hospitalization. At postmortem examination, the kidneys were reduced in size with evidence of cortical attenuation. Increased mesangial hypercellularity was observed.

prarenal glands, liver, and mesenterium. Coronary arteries and the aorta were moderately atherosclerotic. Conclusions The clinical history, histopathologic features, and mo- lecular ﬁ ndings for the 2 mink farmers exposed to AMDV were similar to those described for AD in mink. The com-bination of clinical and laboratory ﬁ ndings is unique for these patients compared with previous reports. These 2 patients had micro- and macroangiopathic lesions and prolonged persistence of serum antibodies to AMDV and AMDV DNA. On the basis of its early onset, dissemination, and se- verity, the slight atherosclerosis found in some histopato-logic specimens from patient 1 represent a consequence of the pre-existing arteritis rather than a primary condition. Buerger disease is unlikely on the basis of cytopathologic and histopathologic ﬁ ndings, and other vasculitic disorders were excluded on the basis of serologic ﬁ ndings. The ar- teritis was similar to the autoimmune vascular lesions ac-companying AD in mink with adventitial lymphocytic in-ﬁ ltration ( 4). The histopathologic ﬁ ndings for patient 2, in whom the autoimmune glomerulonephritis was diagnosed 8 years before the ﬁ rst measurement of anti-AMDV anti- bodies, resembled the immune complex–mediated glom-erulonephritis in mink with AD ( 6). For patient 1, anti-AMDV antibodies persisted 4 years from his last exposure to mink, exceeding the longest re-ported duration of positive AMDV response in a human in the absence of virus exposure ( 11). Similarly, patient 2 had a long-lasting antibody response, although under po-tentially persisting exposure. The persistence of anti-AM-DV antibodies in patient 2 may re ﬂ ect host-related factors in the modulation of immune response to chronic antigen stimulation. In mink, host-related factors in ﬂ uence their susceptibility to AMDV infection and correlate with clini-cal manifestations from an asymptomatic condition to overt disease. One may speculate whether the overrepresentation of malignant lymphoma in mink farmers could re ﬂ ect a part of a disease spectrum paralleling monoclonal plasma cell proliferation in mink ( 15). That AMDV DNA was found only in the ﬁ rst biopsy sample from patient 1 may weaken the hypothesis of vi-rus replication. However, it may re ﬂ ect technical dif ﬁ cul- ties with DNA ampli ﬁ cation after paraf ﬁ n embedding of the specimen or a possible later clearance of the virus from infected tissues. Regardless, we have described our clinico-pathologic and molecular ﬁ ndings with the goal of raising awareness about the possible role of AMDV replication in human disease.

Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome, Beijing, People’s Republic of China Li-Qun Fang,1 Wen-Juan Zhao,1 Sake J. de Vlas, Wen-Yi Zhang, Song Liang, Caspar W.N. Looman, Lei Yan, Li-Ping Wang, Jia-Qi Ma, Dan Feng, Hong Yang, and Wu-Chun Cao We used geographic information systems to character- ize the dynamic change in spatial distribution of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Beijing, People’s Re-public of China. The seasonal variation in its incidence was observed by creating an epidemic curve. HFRS was associ-ated with developed land, orchards, and rice paddies. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a rodent-borne disease caused by hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae ), is characterized by fever, acute renal dys- function, and hemorrhage manifestations. Various rodent species are natural hosts and serve as sources of infection (1). Humans usually acquire hantavirus infection by con- tact with or inhalation of aerosols or excreta from infected rodents ( 2,3). In the People’s Republic of China, HFRS is caused mainly by 2 types of hantaviruses, Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV), each of which has co-evolved with a distinct rodent host. HTNV is associated with Apodemus agrarius , whereas SEOV, which causes a less severe form of HFRS, is associated with Rattus nor- vegicus . Although HFRS infection has long been recog- nized in many places throughout mainland China, HFRS was ﬁ rst reported in metropolitan Beijing in 1997. Since then, the natural foci have been established, and human cases were continuously diagnosed in the new disease-endemic region ( 4). The presence and transmission of hantavirus depend on the distribution and infection of its animal hosts, which largely determine the incidence and extent of HFRS; such distribution and infection are usually determined by envi-ronmental elements ( 5,6). Ecologic studies in China demon- strated that elevation, precipitation, temperature, vegetation type, and soil type in ﬂ uenced transmission of HTNV ( 7,8). However, these studies were conducted on a relatively large scale, usually at the county or even province level. Envi-ronmental factors driving variability in HFRS incidence at a ﬁ ner scale (e.g., township) remain poorly understood. The availability of detailed records of HFRS cases and en-vironmental information in the newly established disease-endemic region provides an opportunity to explore possible factors underlying the emergence of the rodent-borne dis-ease. In this study, we aimed to learn the current situation of endemic HFRS in Beijing, characterize its spatiotempo-ral distribution, and identify environmental factors possibly contributing to the incidence of the disease. The Study The study area covered metropolitan Beijing (between 115°20′ and 117°30 ′ E, and 39°28 ′ and 41°05 ′N), including 220 townships of 18 districts with an area of 16,800 km The data on reported HFRS cases were obtained from the National Noti ﬁ able Disease Surveillance System, which in- cluded information about sex, age, residential address, and onset date of symptoms for each case. A total of 852 HFRS cases were reported in Beijing metropolis during 1997–2006. The annual incidence of each district was calculated by using the ﬁ fth national census data in 2000 and mapped by using a geographic in-formation system (GIS) technique by digitalizing village, street, and boundaries on the 1:100,000 topographic map of Beijing in ArcGIS 9.0 software (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA). Each HFRS case was geocoded according to residential address, and a layer including information about HFRS cases was created and overlayed on the digital map. By 2000, the disease had affected all the area of the city. However, the incidence in each district varied during the 10-year study period (Figure 1). An epidemic curve was created to show the temporal distribution of HFRS in Beijing. The annual incidence had sharply increased from 1997 to 1999; thereafter it ﬂ uctuated around 0.8 ± 0.2/100,000 persons (Figure 2). Within each year, the incidence varied markedly; most cases occurred in winter and spring, usually peaking in April, although the disease was reported in almost every month (Figure 2).

To study factors related to HFRS spread, we com- pared the incidence with various environmental indicators. Data on elevation were collected from a digital elevation model. Land cover data were derived from 2005 Landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper image by using ENVI 4.0 soft-ware (Research Systems Inc., Boulder, CO, USA). Land use types were classi ﬁ ed as follows: built-up land, water body, dry land, scrub, orchard, irrigable land, rice paddies, and forest. Average elevation and area of different land use type of each township were calculated by ArcTools and Spatial Analyst module in ArcGIS 9.0 software (ESRI Inc.). To determine the associations between the number of HFRS cases per township during the study period and el-evation, as well as land use type, we performed standard Poisson regression analysis by using STATA 9.1 software (StataCorp LP, College Station TX, USA) ( 9). The percent- age change in incidence in response to the value change of the variable by a given amount and its 95% con ﬁ dence in- terval and corresponding p value were estimated after cor-rection for overdispersion. The Poisson regression analysis indicated that built-up land, orchard, and rice paddies were signiﬁ cantly associated with HFRS at p<0.05 (Table). The incidence rose with increasing coverage of orchard and rice paddies, but dropped with decreasing coverage of built-up land.Conclusions Since the ﬁ rst local infection was reported in 1997, HFRS cases have occurred in all 18 districts of Beijing, with a fairly stable annual incidence since 1999. The dy-namic change in spatial distribution con ﬁ rmed the focal nature of the rodent-borne disease. The seasonality is one of the epidemiologic characteristics of HFRS, and further indicates that HFRS in the region is caused by SEOV with domestic rats, with mainly R. norvegicus as the source of infection ( 10,11) The rat population apparently peaks in winter, resulting in a lagged impact on transmission and DISPATCHES 2044 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 Figure 1.

Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome seasonal variation of HFRS. In addition, rats are more ac- tive in homes in the winter because of cold temperature outside; this increases the chance for humans to acquire the infection by contact or inhalation of aerosols and secretions from infected rodents. Our ﬁ ndings suggest that residents of townships with not too much built-up land but with orchard or rice paddies are at highest risk for infection. The land-use variables (acting as economic development indicators) are likely to be suitable for predicting the presence and distribution of HFRS in Beijing, where the disease recently emerged and economic development has greatly increased. Suit-able control measures, such as removing rodents and preventing them from entering houses and human food storage buildings, should be taken to reduce incidence in this new disease-endemic region. However, the emer-gence and endemicity of HFRS are not determined only by the economic development activities, although they are important environmental contributors to the transmis-sion of the disease. Biologic, ecologic, and social factors such as population immunity level, abundance and infec-tion rate of host rodents, and human behavior, also may affect transmission of HFRS. Further epidemiologic and ecologic studies are required to understand the exact vari-ables contributing to the emergence and extension of the disease during urbanization.This study was supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (no. 30725032), Special Pro-gram for Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases (no. 2008ZX10004-012), Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 30590374), and Beijing Natural Science Foundation (no. 7061005).

Age Patterns of Persons with Campylobacteriosis, England and Wales, 1990–2007 Iain A. Gillespie, Sarah J. O’Brien, and Frederick J. Bolton To explore hypotheses for age-related changes in the incidence of Campylobacter infections in England and Wales during 1990–2007, we analyzed electronic labora-tory data. Disease incidence reduced among children, and the greatest increase in risk was among those >60 years of age. Risk factors for campylobacteriosis in the elderly popu-lation should be identi ﬁ ed. Campylobacter infection remains a major public health problem worldwide. The infection is unpleasant, al- though generally self-limiting, and most patients experi-ence acute enteritis for 7 to 10 days ( 1). Approximately one tenth of patients with laboratory-con ﬁ rmed cases require hospital treatment as a result of their illness ( 2), and a range of gastrointestinal, arthritic, and neurologic sequelae add to disease effects ( 3). Although food is likely the main source of transmission to humans, most human infections cannot be explained by recognized risk factors. In the late 1970s, when the role of Campylobacter spp. in human gastrointestinal disease had been newly appreci-ated, the number of laboratory-con ﬁ rmed infections in Eng- land and Wales began to rise; 8,956 cases were reported in 1980 and 33,234 in 1989 (Health Protection Agency, unpub. data). This increase was largely artifactual, re ﬂ ecting in- creased scienti ﬁ c interest in, and testing for, Campylobacter spp. and improvements in media and methods for isolating them ( 4,5). The incidence continued to rise throughout the 1990s and peaked in 2000 at 58,236 cases. The reasons for this increase are unknown; further methodologic improve-ments or increased surveillance activity in that decade can-not fully explain it. Incidence rapidly decreased between 2000 and 2004 (from 57,674 to 44,294 cases; 24% decrease; Health Protection Agency, unpub. data), after which inci-dence increased for 3 consecutive years; provisional total was 51,758 cases in 2007 (Health Protection Agency, un-pub. data). The reasons for these recent changes in incidence are again unknown. To explore hypotheses for changes in incidence related to age, we analyzed electronic laboratory data for Campylobacter infections reported in England and Wales from 1990 through 2007. The Study Data on all Campylobacter isolates obtained from fecal or lower gastrointestinal tract samples, reported in England and Wales from 1990 through 2007, were extracted from the national laboratory database (LabBase) and stored in a Microsoft Access (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) database. Cases were assigned to 10-year age groups and to geographic areas on the basis of laboratory location (north-ern, mid-country, southern). The season was assigned on the basis of the earliest available specimen date (spring, March–May; summer, June–August; autumn, September–November; winter, December–February). Data on cases of cryptosporidiosis and nontyphoidal salmonellosis for the same period were extracted and manipulated as above for comparative purposes. Denominator data for England and Wales for the same period were obtained from the Of ﬁ ce for National Statistics. Data were analyzed in Microsoft Ex-cel 2003 and Stata version 10 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Estimates of incidence per 100,000 population were calculated throughout; relative risks (RR) and 95% conﬁ dence intervals (CIs) were calculated as required. From 1990 through 2007 in England and Wales, 838,436 cases of Campylobacter infection were report- ed; patient age was available for 810,632 case-patients (96.7%). From 1990 through 1999, incidence increased in all age groups (Figure 1), but the increase was propor-tionate to increasing age (0–9 years of age RR 1.07 [95% CI 1.03–1.10]; 10–19 years RR 1.47 [95% CI 1.41–1.55]; 20–59 years RR 1.78 [95% CI 1.75–1.81]; ≥60 years RR 51 [95% CI 2.41–2.61]). From 2000 through 2004, inci-dence declined in all age groups. However, although the degree of decline was similar for those 0–9 years of age (RR 0.77 [95% CI 0.74–0.8]), 10–19 years (RR 0.73 [95% CI 0.70–0.76]), and 20–59 years (RR 0.75 [95% CI 0.74–0.76]), for patients aged ≥60 years, the degree of decline was signi ﬁ cantly lower (RR 0.88 [95% CI 0.86–0.91]; χ 2 p<0.001). Finally, although the incidence increased only moderately among those 10–19 years of age (RR 1.02 [95% CI 0.98–1.07]) and 20–59 years (RR 1.04 [95% CI 1.03–1.06]) from 2005 through 2007, greater increases were observed for those 0–9 years (RR 1.12 [95% CI 1.08–1.17]) and those ≥60 years (RR 1.33 [95% CI 1.29–1.36]). During the surveillance period, therefore, the incidence among patients >60 years of age, compared with the in-cidence among younger patients, increased markedly (RR 0.45 [95% CI 0.44–0.47] in 1990 to RR 1.17 [95% CI DISPATCHES 2046 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Author af ﬁ liations: Health Protection Agency Centre for Infections, London, UK (I.A.

Campylobacteriosis, England and Wales, 1990–2007 15–1.19] in 2007). This effect was observed for campy- lobacteriosis in both sexes, in 3 geographic areas of Eng-land and Wales, and in all 4 seasons, but was not observed for nontyphoidal salmonellosis or cryptosporidiosis (Fig-ure 2; online Appendix Table, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/1/2046-appT.htm). We report a striking change in the population at risk for campylobacteriosis in England and Wales, which is in-dependent of gender, geography, or season. The absence of a similar change in the age distribution of laboratory-reported salmonellosis or cryptosporidiosis from the same population suggests that this is unlikely to be a surveillance artifact. Campylobacter infections are rarely typed beyond the genus level in England and Wales, so infections are routine-ly reported as Campylobacter species. Therefore, changes in the incidence of the various species that constitute this broad case de ﬁ nition could possibly explain some of the altered disease pattern reported. For example, infections caused by certain species (e.g., C. fetus ) are more often as- sociated with coexisting conditions that might occur more frequently in the elderly. This circumstance was unlikely to affect the results of this study, however. First, isolation methods used in England and Wales favor the growth of C. jejuni and C. coli (4,5) over that of other species, including C. fetus . Furthermore, C. fetus normally causes systemic infections detected through blood culture, and the propor-tion of blood isolations of Campylobacter species in pa- tients ≥60 years of age reported in England and Wales re- mained constant from 1990 through 1999 (275/58,139 fecal isolations; 0.47%), from 2000 through 2004 (185/44,349; 0.42%), and from 2005 through 2007 (135/31,637; 0.42%) (Health Protection Agency, unpub. data). When disease incidence was ranked according to spe- ciﬁ c population group, children 0–9 years of age had the highest ranking in 1990, but by 2007, incidence for this age group ranked seventh of 9 age groups. Incidence among children <10 years declined most rapidly from 1998 to 2003. This ﬁ nding led to the hypothesis that the introduc- tion and increased utilization of NHS Direct (a 24-hour telephone, online, and interactive digital TV service, which provided health advice and information) at this time had a “triage effect” on primary care presentation for this age group. The 2 events are correlated in time (initial NHS Di-rect pilot sites began taking calls in March 1998; by April 1999, 40% of the population of England had access, and by November 2000, the service was available throughout England and Wales [ 6]), NHS Direct has had a demon- strable negative effect on the use of general practice ( 7), and infants and young children are overrepresented among calls to NHS Direct about gastrointestinal conditions ( 8). The second Infectious Intestinal Disease study in England, currently under way ( 9), will provide further information upon which to assess this hypothesis, which is not readily testable by using laboratory data. By far the most striking ﬁ nding of this study is the emergence of older persons as the population most at risk for campylobacteriosis in England and Wales. Although the elderly were not the only group at risk in 2007 (because of increasing incidence), the overall trend singles them out Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2047 020406080100120140160 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007No. cases/100,000 population 0–9 y 10–19 20–29 30–39 40–49 50–59 60–69 70–79 >80 Figure 1.

as the main emerging at-risk group (the increase in other age groups requires continued monitoring, however). The pattern of infection in older patients is perhaps predict-able, given the similar pattern for incidence of listeriosis in England and Wales since 2001 ( 10). As life expectancy increases in the United Kingdom, the number of persons living with chronic conditions is likely to increase; these factors suggest that the incidence of campylobacteriosis in older persons will continue to increase in the future. There-fore, risk factors for Campylobacter infection speci ﬁ c to older UK residents must be identi ﬁ ed.

Identi ﬁ cation of Francisella tularensis Cluster in Central and Western Europe Paola Pilo,1 Anders Johansson,1 and Joachim Frey We conducted a molecular analysis of Francisella tular- ensis strains isolated in Switzerland and identi ﬁ ed a speci ﬁ c subpopulation belonging to a cluster of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica that is widely dispersed in central and western continental Europe. This subpopulation was present before the tularemia epidemics on the Iberian Peninsula. Tularemia is a classical zoonosis caused by the faculta- tive intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis ; it is transmissible to humans at infectious doses as low as 10–50 bacteria when inhaled in aerosols or by inoculation of the skin. Traditionally, tularemia is thought of as a dis-ease contracted by persons performing outdoor activities such as hunting or farming, but it can also be acquired from pets, for example, hamsters or prairie dogs, which are occasionally traded internationally ( 1). During the past 15 years, the reemergence of tularemia has been re-ported in several European countries ( 2–4). Spain is a no- table example, reporting 916 human infections from 1997 through 2007 in the Castilla and León regions alone ( 5). However, tularemia is rarely diagnosed in central Europe. In Switzerland, F. tularensis infection was ﬁ rst described in the 1950s, but the pathogen was not isolated until 1996, when F. tularensis infection began to reappear sporadi- cally. To better understand the genetic diversity of Swiss F. tularensis strains and their relationship to strains from other geographic areas, we analyzed strains from Switzer-land by using several methods that had been previously demonstrated to resolve genetic differences between F. tularensis subsp. holarctica strains: multilocus tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), canonical F. tularensis insertion deletion element (Ftind) analysis, and region of difference (RD) 23 analysis ( 3,6,7).The Study Thirteen F. tularensis isolates collected over the past 10 years in Switzerland (Figure 1) were subjected to ex-tensive genetic characterization. The species and subspe-cies designations of all strains were con ﬁ rmed by real-time PCR that targeted the fopA gene and by ampli ﬁ cation of the RD1 region ( 8), which showed that all strains were F. tula- rensis subsp. holarctica . A reference panel of 12 F. tular- ensis subsp. holarctica strains ( 7) and the genome sequence of the strain isolated in France, FTNF002 (GenBank acces-sion no. NC_009749), were included in the study to rep-resent the currently known genetic subpopulations within the subspecies. All strains from Switzerland were geneti-cally characterized at 6 highly variable loci (by MLVA) and 14 more stable loci that indicate the classi ﬁ cation F. tularensis subsp. holarctica strains into genetic subpopula- tions (by Ftind analysis) ( 3,6,7). The RD analysis was also performed because a 1.59-kb deletion marker, RD23, was reported to be restricted to strains from France and Spain (3). The MLVA markers (M3, M6, M20, M21, M22, and M24) and Ftind markers (Ftind 25–38) were ampli ﬁ ed by PCR and then sequenced with an ABI Prism 3100 genet-ic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). DNA fragment sizes were calculated from the nucleotide sequences of the MLVA and Ftind markers and used to compare the isolates with previously analyzed strains from the United States, Japan, France, and Russia (3,7). The RD23 marker was assayed by using standard PCR and agarose gel methods as previously described ( 3). A cluster analysis based on the MLVA and indel size data was performed by using BioNumerics version 3.5 (Applied Maths, Kortrjik, Belgium).

As expected, the indel markers served to place each strain into major branches of the cluster tree, and the more variable MLVA markers provided the ﬁ ne resolution at the tips of the tree. The Switzerland strains belonged to the same genetic cluster as the F. tularensis strain FTNF002 from France (Figure 1) that in a previous work clustered with strains from Spain ( 3,9). Moreover, all the Swiss strains exhibited the 1.59-kb genomic deletion at the RD23 locus and the unique 464-bp size at MLVA marker M24, which con ﬁ rmed their close relationship to the French strain FTNF002 as well as to other strains from France and Spain ( 3). The ﬁ nding of F. tularensis strains in Switzerland rep- resent sporadic occurrences of tularemia without any obvi-ous epidemiologic connection. The strains originated from 6 hares, 3 monkeys, and 4 persons and were collected at different locations in Switzerland over a period of 10 years (Figure 2). The human infections most likely occurred through direct contact with wild animals, through rodent bites, and through consumption of a hare cooked at low temperature. Those isolates could be resolved into 7 dif-ferent genotypes (Figure 2). Four Swiss strains displayed a genetic pro ﬁ le identical to that of the representative French strain FTNF002 ( 3). The other 6 genotypes were closely related to FTNF002, and all corresponded to the subclade B.Br:FTNF002–00 as de ﬁ ned by canonical single nucle- otide polymorphisms by Vogler et al. ( 9). This cluster, which also contained the strains from the Iberian Penin-sula, seems to have spread throughout central and western Europe. Moreover, all the Swiss strains were susceptible to erythromycin (MICs 0.25 μg/mL to 1 μg/mL), which is a phenotypic marker that has previously been suggested to divide F. tularensis subsp. holarctica strains into 2 taxo- nomic groups ( 10–12 ). Conclusions Strains of F. tularensis from Switzerland (central Eu- rope) genetically clustered with strains from France and Spain (western Europe) as determined by the unique 464-bp genetic marker M24 and a speci ﬁ c deletion at marker RD23. Furthermore, strains within the cluster differed at only 2 MLVA markers,and 4 other MLVA and 14 Ftind markers were identical. In a previous study that included strains from the 1997–1998 tularemia outbreak in Spain, the speci ﬁ c M24 allele and the RD23 deletion were found in 49 of 49 strains from Spain and France but in only 1 of 189 strains from 7 northern and eastern European coun-tries and Japan ( 3). The tularemia outbreak of 1997–1998 in Spain, which resulted in >500 human cases ( 5), was thus caused by F. tularensis strains that were genetically closely related to strains recovered in Switzerland from 1996 onwards, before the beginning of the outbreaks in Spain. This genetic relationship shows that factors other than the presence or introduction of a speci ﬁ c clone of the infectious agent per se determined the magnitude of the tularemia outbreaks in Spain. For epidemiologists to understand the distribution of F. tularensis (and other rare disease agents) in the environment and their propaga-tion across national and geographic borders, surveillance programs that include molecular analyses of these agents should be undertaken in multiple countries, and the result-ing data should be shared internationally.

New Adenovirus in Bats, Germany Michael Sonntag, Kristin Mühldorfer, Stephanie Speck, Gudrun Wibbelt, and Andreas Kurth We tested 55 deceased vespertilionid bats of 12 spe- cies from southern Germany for virus infections. A new ad-enovirus was isolated from tissue samples of 2 Pipistrellus pipistrellus bats, which represents the only chiropteran virus isolate found in Europe besides lyssavirus (rabies virus). Evi-dence was found for adenovirus transmission between bats. Since the recent discoveries of Ebola virus, Henipavi- rus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus infections, interest in the role of bats as hosts for pathogens has markedly increased ( 1). With the excep- tion of worldwide studies on bat lyssaviruses ( 2), most vi- rologic investigations in bats have been limited to a particu-lar zoonotic agent implicated in a geographically localized disease outbreak ( 3–5). In the remaining studies, various medically less important viruses have been discovered in bats in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia ( 1,6). As a result of increasing research efforts regarding bats and infectious diseases in Europe, 2 new virus groups were recently detected, namely beta- and gammaherpesviruses in organ tissue ( 7) and group I coronaviruses in feces of European vespertilionid bats ( 8). However, because all bat species in Europe/Germany are protected by strict regula-tions, the acquisition of suitable samples for virus isolation is rather challenging in comparison to most other parts of the world. The Study We performed an extensive search for unknown vi- ruses in 55 German vespertilionid bats based on both ge-neric PCR assays and virus isolation techniques, as part of a broader study investigating histopathologic changes in German bats in association with infectious pathogens. Dead or moribund bats of 12 species ( Barbastella barbas- tellus, Eptesicus nilssoni, E. serotinus, Myotis daubentonii, M. mystacinus, Nyctalus leisleri, N. noctula, Pipistrellus kuhli, P. nathusii, P. pipistrellus, Plecotus auritus , and Vespertilio murinus ) were collected at certi ﬁ ed bat rehabil- itation centers in southern Germany and were investigated macroscopically, bacteriologically, and histologically.For virologic examination, homogenized organ tissue was inoculated onto VeroE6/7 cells and monitored daily for cytopathic effects. Remaining tissue material was used for RNA/DNA extraction and further molecular analysis by generic PCR assays to detect members of several vi-rus families including ﬂ aviviruses, hantaviruses, coronavi- ruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses. The spe-cies of bat involved was determined by ampli ﬁ cation and sequencing of the cytochrome B ( cytB) gene, a standard technique for species identi ﬁ cation ( 9). Of the tested samples from 55 bats, virus was initially detected in only 2 adult common pipistrelles ( P. pipistrellus , nos. 198/07 and 199/07). A cytopathic effect was detected in Vero E6/7 cells after the second passage, indicating the presence of virus in the cell culture. Puri ﬁ ed supernatant of these cell cultures was subjected to negative-staining elec-tron microscopy, which showed numerous adenovirus-like particles ( Figure 1, panel A ).

New Adenovirus in Bats, Germany veriﬁ ed by the ﬁ rst reaction of a generic adenovirus-specif- ic nested PCR ( 10). The obtained sequence of a fragment of the DNA polymerase gene ( ≈550 bp) indicated that the viruses were a novel virus type within the genus Mastade- novirus and was tentatively named bat adenovirus 2 (bat AdV-2) strain P. pipistrellus virus 1 (PPV1). To obtain additional sequence information of bat AdV-2, a random PCR method (virus discovery based on cDNA–ampli ﬁ ed fragment length polymorphism) ( 11) was applied, which showed >20 adenovirus sequences dis-tributed over the genome ( Figure 1, panel B ). The partial sequence of the bat AdV-2 DNA polymerase (3,408 bp; GenBank accession no. FJ983127) was obtained after Lon-gRange PCR by using the Expand Long Range dNTPack (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufac-turer’s directions and the following 2 primers: ABS F1-B (5′-AAAAgAggCAAAgCAAgACAgTgg-3 ′) and ABS R2-B (5′-ggCgggCAACAAAgACCTCA-3 ′). After repeat- ed sequence analysis of the partial DNA polymerase gene for validation, we found that the identities of bat AdV-2 PPV1 to closely related adenoviruses ranged from 68% to 74% on nucleic acid level ( Table 1 ), with the closest rela- tionship found to canine adenoviruses 1 and 2. So far, the only other adenovirus in bats has been accidentally isolated from primary bat kidney cells of a healthy Ryukyu ﬂ ying fox ( Pteropus dasymallus yayeyamae ) (12), which proved to have a rather distant phylogenetic relationship to bat AdV-2 ( Figure 2 ). On the basis of newly acquired sequence informa- tion, we designed a speci ﬁ c real-time TaqMan PCR to detect bat AdV-2 (ABS forward 5 ′-CACAAgTgg TgTCTTTgAgAgCA-3 ′, ABS reverse 5 ′-AgAgggATAC AAACTgATggAAACA-3 ′, ABS TM 6FAM-CTAACTT- ggCTggTggAgTgCgAAAC-q). Cycler conditions were as follows: predenaturation (95°C for 10 min), 45 ampli ﬁ ca- tion cycles (95°C for 30 s, 61°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s), and ﬁ nal extension (72°C for 10 min). After screening all 55 bats from Germany of 12 spe- cies, comprising an additional 11 common pipistrelles, an identical adenovirus was detected in 1 additional common pipistrelle. Moreover, the tissue tropism of bat AdV-2 was investigated in all 3 infected bats ( Table 2 ). Of all tested or- gans, bat AdV-2 was detected in high DNA copy numbers in the intestine of all 3 bats with lesser DNA copy numbers in liver and kidneys, whereas the other organs contained lit-tle or no adenovirus DNA. Unfortunately, due to advanced tissue decomposition in most of the organs, including liver, kidneys, and intestines, thorough histopathologic examina- tion of the 3 bats was markedly impaired. Conclusions In contrast to Maeda et al. ( 12), who postulated the ne- cessity of primary bat cells to isolate DNA virus from chi-roptera, our isolation of a DNA virus from an European bat in a permanent cell line (monkey kidney cells) proved the opposite. We believe that the rare detection and isolation of viruses might be attributed to the fast natural degradation of bats of the suborder Microchiroptera in comparison to that of other animal carcasses, most likely due to their extreme-ly low weight (2–10 g). Although viruses were not detected by various generic PCR assays from homogenized frozen tissue samples, we isolated a novel virus from a hibernating Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2053 Table 1.

insectivorous bat species. This virus was detected in high DNA copy numbers in the intestine of 3 bats that died of natural causes. The fact that no other viral or bacterial agents were de- tected in these animals suggests a clinical correlation to the isolated adenovirus. Moreover, all 3 bats belonged to the same species and were of similar age. Several days before their death, they were found moribund and subsequently admitted together to the rehabilitation center, which high-lights the strong likelihood of infection in the colony of ori-gin. Cross-contamination during tissue preparation can be excluded because sterilized instruments were used for each animal, and after every incision, instruments were cleaned with 70% ethanol and a Bunsen burner ﬂ ame to destroy adhering tissue remnants. Various adenovirus types of the genus Mastdenovirus infect a range of different mammals and cause respiratory, ocular, and gastrointestinal diseases. Here, in all 3 infected bats, the highest copy number of adenovirus DNA was de-tected in the intestine, which suggests a correlation with a gastrointestinal disease. The host range of mastadenovirus-es is known to be limited to a single (or a few closely relat-ed) mammalian species ( 13) with a probable co-evolution between virus and their hosts ( 14). The acquired partial se- quence of the bat AdV-2 DNA polymerase with the closest relation to canine adenovirus (only 74% at the nucleic acid level) and the isolation from a new animal host suggests that this virus is a new adenovirus species within the genus Mastadenovirus . A comparison to the only other adenovi- rus found in a bat ( ﬂ ying fox, order Megachiroptera) with the available sequence information of a ≈550-bp fragment of the DNA polymerase gene showed their distant relation-ship. This strict separation re ﬂ ects either the co-evolution- ary development between the 2 adenoviruses (bat AdV-1 FBV1, bat AdV-2 PPV1) and their host families Pteropodi-dae and Vespertilionidae or a host switch of the virus origi-nating from a yet-undetermined vertebrate host. To eluci-date this problem, further research will be necessary. In conclusion, we isolated a new virus from free- ranging vespertilionid bats, which represents the only chi-ropteran virus isolate besides lyssavirus (rabies) found in Europe. Moreover, the detection of this chiropteran virus can be connected with its transmission between individual bats living in close proximity to other bats.Acknowledgments We are grateful to bat protectionists for bat collection; Jung- Won Sim-Brandenburg, Julia Tesch, and Angelina Kus for excel-lent technical assistance; Andreas Nitsche for design of the real-time PCR assay for bat AdV-2; and Ursula Erikli and Alan Curry for their dedicated editorial help.

Human Trichinosis after Consumption of Soft-Shelled Turtles, Taiwan Yi-Chun Lo, Chien-Ching Hung, Ching-Shih Lai, Zhiliang Wu, Isao Nagano, Takuya Maeda, Yuzo Takahashi, Chan-Hsien Chiu, and Donald Dah-Shyong Jiang In 2008, an outbreak of human trichinosis associated with ingestion of raw soft-shelled turtles was identi ﬁ ed and investigated in Taiwan. The data suggested that patients were likely infected with Trichinella papuae. Trichinosis is a zoonotic disease caused by species of the nematode Trichinella . In eastern Asia, human trichi- nosis has been reported in the People’s Republic of China, Japan, and Korea ( 1–4). Trichinosis among humans and animals has not been reported in Taiwan ( 1,5,6). Although the major source of human infection is the meat of mam-mals, reptiles recently have been found to serve as hosts for certain Trichinella species. T. zimbabwensis , detected in the muscles of Nile crocodiles ( Crocodylus niloticus ) in Zimbabwe in 1995, is the ﬁ rst species of Trichinella found in a reptile host naturally infected with Trichinella (7). No human infection has been documented. Another species, T. papuae , was detected in a farmed saltwater crocodile in Papua New Guinea in 2004 ( 8). A trichinosis outbreak in humans caused by T. papuae , associated with eating wild boar meat, occurred in Thailand ( 9). Trichinosis in humans related to consumption of reptile meat was ﬁ rst described in Thailand; the source was turtle and brown lizard meat ( 10). We report an outbreak of human trichinosis in Taiwan in which eating raw soft-shelled turtles ( Pelodiscus sinensis ) was the suspected mode of infection. The Study In July 2008, four teaching hospitals in northern Tai- wan consecutively reported to the Department of Health of Taipei City Government (DHTCG) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 8 patients in 2 groups in whom fever, myalgias, and eosinophilia of unknown cause de- veloped after they shared a common food source in May 2008. Group A, comprising 20 Taiwanese, participated in a festive meal in Taipei City at a Japanese food restau-rant, and were served raw meat, blood, liver, and eggs of 3 of the 5 soft-shelled turtles provided by the host, a supplier of soft-shelled turtles. The other 2 soft-shelled turtles were refrigerated at 4°C and served at the same restaurant to a group of 3 Japanese customers (group B) 6 days later. DHTCG and Taiwan CDC jointly investigated this outbreak. The restaurant had never previously served raw or undercooked soft-shelled turtles. Restaurant patrons other than those in groups A and B did not eat raw or un-dercooked soft-shelled turtles. Five of the 20 Taiwanese in group A and the 3 Japanese in group B exhibited signs and symptoms 1–3 weeks after eating at the restaurant and were deﬁ ned as case-patients (Table 1). The 15 asymptomatic persons were de ﬁ ned as controls. The most common symptoms were myalgia (88%), fe- ver (88%), malaise (63%), and periorbital swelling (38%). Seven case-patients whose blood was analyzed all had eo-sinophilia and increased serum creatine phosphokinase and alanine aminotransferase levels. Five case-patients were hospitalized. Two patients underwent extensive serologic testing for helminths by ELISA, including tests for Diro ﬁ - laria immitis, Toxocara canis, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ani-sakis spp., Gnathostoma spinigerum, Strongyloides sterc- oralis, Paragonimus westermanii, Paragonimus miyazakii, Fasciola hepatica, Clonorchis sinensis, Spirometra eri-nacei, Taenia solium, and Trichinella spp. Both patients had weakly positive results for A. lumbricoides, G. spini- gerum, and S. stercoralis and strongly reactive results for Trichinella spp. Serum samples from 5 patients during the acute phase (3–5 weeks postexposure) and from all 8 patients during the convalescent phase (7–9 weeks postexposure) were sent to the Department of Parasitology, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan, for Trichinella serologic diagnosis, with ELI- SA and immunohistochemical staining. Of the 15 controls, none consented to give a blood sample. Brie ﬂ y, the ELISA microtiter plates were sensitized with excretory-secretory (ES) antigen from T. spiralis or T. pseudospiralis , probed with a diluted human serum sample (1:200–1:6,400), and incubated with 100 μL of 1:10,000-diluted goat antihuman immunoglobulin G (Fab speci ﬁ c) peroxidase-conjugate (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). Absorbance at 414 nm was monitored with a plate reader. All samples were analyzed in duplicate. The cutoff point was 3× the mean values of the A 414 for the negative controls. Immu- nohistochemical staining was performed by incubating skeletal muscle tissues from T. spiralis– infected mice with the serum specimens (1:200 dilution) for 1 h at 37°C and DISPATCHES 2056 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009Author af ﬁ liations: Centers for Disease Control, Taipei, Taiwan (Y.-C.

Trichinosis and Sort-Shelled Turtles processing the sections with the HistoStain SP kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA). In both the acute and convalescent phases, all serum samples reacted to T. spiralis and T. pseudospiralis ES antigen and were positive in immunohistochemical stain-ing (Table 1). The diagnosis of trichinosis was con ﬁ rmed. Mebendazole or albendazole was prescribed for all patients, and their symptoms gradually resolved. We conducted semistructured interviews with the 8 case-patients and 15 controls in both groups to learn which food items they had eaten at the restaurant. None had eaten raw or undercooked soft-shelled turtles before this outbreak (Table 2). In univariate analysis, consumption of raw soft-shelled turtle meat was strongly associated with infection (p = 0.003). Trichinosis developed in 8 (62%) of the 13 persons who ate raw soft-shelled turtle meat. We performed an environmental study of the restau- rant and the soft-shelled turtle farm. No leftover food was available from the restaurant for analysis. The soft-shelled turtles were bred arti ﬁ cially and hatched on a farm in Tai- wan. They were fed only indigenous ﬁ sh and shell ﬁ sh. The farm used neither imported feed nor feed containing any mammals or reptiles. Microscopic inspection, with a meat-digesting method, of the soft-shelled turtles obtained from the farm 2 months after the outbreak did not show Trichinella spp. After the investigation, Taiwan CDC is- sued a press release to describe the outbreak and alert the public of the risk for trichinosis from eating raw or under-cooked soft-shelled turtles. Conclusions The incubation period, clinical features, and labora- tory ﬁ ndings in this outbreak are similar to those of other reported trichinosis outbreaks associated with eating mam-mals ( 11,12). T. papuae and T. zimbabwensis are the most likely parasites causing this outbreak because of their abil- Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2057 Table 1.

ity to infect mammals and reptiles ( 13). The ELISA method has limited speci ﬁ city because of cross-reactions with non- Trichinella helminths ( 14). Moreover, because of similar antigen patterns among all Trichinella spp., the antigens prepared with 1 species can be used to detect speci ﬁ c anti- bodies in patients infected with any species ( 1). Therefore, although we detected strongly reactive antibodies to T. spiralis and T. pseudospiralis , we could not determine the etiologic Trichinella sp. in this outbreak without parasitic diagnosis. A recent study demonstrated that the 53-kDa recombi- nant proteins in larval ES products could provide species-speciﬁ c antibody responses in Trichinella -infected mice (15). We assessed the absorbance at 414 nm with a 1:200- diluted serum sample in our patients by using the 53-kDa recombinant proteins expressed from 5 Trichinella species (T. spiralis, T. britovi, T. nativa, T. pseudospiralis, and T. papuae ). Our preliminary results showed that convales- cent-phase serum specimens from 6 of the 8 case-patients reacted most strongly to the 53-kDa recombinant protein of T. papuae . Although application of this method in spe- cies-speci ﬁ c human diagnosis requires further studies, the data suggest our patients were likely to be infected with T. papuae. Because we have not yet determined how soft- shelled turtles were infected by T. papuae in this outbreak, further investigation of the potential infectious source is warranted. Persons in many parts of the world typically consume raw or uncooked reptile meat. Further investigations are ur-gently needed to assess the epidemiology of reptile trichi-nosis and the human risk for trichinosis from reptiles.

LETTERS Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 To the Editor : As the world strug- gles with the challenges of in ﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009, it is clear that treatment options for critically ill in-fected patients are suboptimal because deaths continue to be reported in oth-erwise young and healthy patients. Ex-tracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an established therapeutic option for patients with medically re-fractory cardiogenic or respiratory fail-ure. We describe the successful use of ECMO in a patient with complicated pneumonia and inﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection. Our patient, a 21-year-old woman who was 4 months postpartum, had poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes (hemoglobin A1C level 13.2 mg/dL). She sought treatment at an-other hospital after 3 days of respira-tory symptoms, a productive cough af-ter working in her garden, and a fever >103°F. Her condition rapidly dete-riorated, and she required mechanical ventilation, vasoactive medications, and drotecogin- α (Xigris; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for profound shock. The patient was then transferred to Ohio State University Medical Center on August 24, 2009; at admis-sion she exhibited hypotension (83/43 mm Hg) and tachycardia (159 bpm), despite having received high doses of vasoactive medications (norepineph-rine 1.0 μg/kg/min, phenylephrine 2.0 μg/kg/min). A transthoracic echocar- diograph showed severe biventricular failure (ejection fraction 5%–10%); peak tropinin level was 6 mg/dL. Arte-rial blood gas con ﬁ rmed metabolic ac- idosis (pH 7.12, partial carbon dioxide pressure [pCO 2] 48 mm Hg, pO2 117 mm Hg, HCO3 15.3 mmol/L). Despite ﬂ uid resuscitation and administration of epinephrine (0.06 μg/kg/min), her condition failed to improve, and she was given femoral vein–femoral ar-tery ECMO. A comprehensive search for infectious causes was undertaken. Treatment with broad-spectrum em-piric antimicrobial drugs such as linezolid (P ﬁ zer, Inc, New York, NY , USA), piperacillin/tazobactam (Wyeth, Madison, NJ, USA), and doxycycline (P ﬁ zer, Inc) and the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tami ﬂ u; Roche Laboratories Inc., Nutley, NJ, USA), 150 mg 2×/d, was started. Re-spiratory cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus glaucus. Naf- cillin and voriconazole were added to the treatment regimen. PCR of a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen later identi ﬁ ed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. The patient was weaned from ECMO on hospital day (HD) 10 and extubated on HD11. Repeat cardiovascular evaluation showed normal biventricular function and no coronary disease. She was discharged from hospital for rehabilitation on September 15, 2009 (HD 22), with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air and is now fully recovered. The use of ECMO is an estab- lished option for patients with medi-cally refractory acute and reversible cardiopulmonary failure ( 1–3) (Table). For isolated respiratory failure, veno–veno support can be used by femoral vein to femoral vein or femoral vein to right internal jugular vein cannulation. With concomitant cardiogenic shock, veno–arterial cannulation may be re-quired with cannulation of the right internal jugular or femoral vein for outﬂ ow, and for in ﬂ ow, the femoral artery directly or the axillary artery by a surgically placed side graft.

LETTERS limited success for complications of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 ( 5). Its broad- er use in treating critically ill patients has been limited, however, because ECMO requires substantial institution-al and multidisciplinary commitment for implementation and is typically only available at major medical centers offering cardiovascular surgery. Although we cannot say speci ﬁ - cally why our patient survived, clearly, aggressive and comprehensive empiric treatment, physiologic support, and close multidisciplinary communication were vital to managing the condition of this critically ill patient. ECMO may have assisted in organ recovery and pa-tient survival. However, further studies should be conducted to critically evalu-ate ECMO in the armamentarium of therapeutic options for severe pandem-ic (H1N1) 2009 respiratory failure. Michael S.

The ﬁ rst cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Argentina were reported in early May 2009 in travelers returning from Mexico and the United States. In mid-June, a sharp increase was reported in the number of patients with acute respiratory symptoms who were seek-ing treatment in emergency rooms. By July 9th, the Argentinean Ministry of Health had con ﬁ rmed 2,677 cases and 82 deaths; most of those infected were residents of Buenos Aires and the sur-rounding area ( 1). When the World Health Organization raised the pan-demic level to 6, >80% of circulating inﬂ uenza A virus in Argentina was sub-type H1N1 ( 2). At the Hospital Central de San Isidro, a tertiary hospital of 160 beds in the Province of Buenos Aires, initial clinical evaluation of patients with ILI symptoms included physical examination and, eventually, chest ra-diograph and pulse oximetry. Because diagnostic resources were limited, pa-tients with ILI were eligible to receive oseltamivir with no prior sampling for respiratory pathogens. A standardized form was used for prescription and data collection, including demographic data, history of in ﬂ uenza vaccination, date symptoms began, and coexisting illnesses. From June 16 to July 5, a total of 2,135 patients with ILI were evaluated. The age of patients ranged from 14 to 82 years of age (median, 35 years); 854 patients (40 %) were male. Because of lower respiratory disease, a total of 166 (8%) of 2,135 patients were admitted to the internal medicine ward (n = 139) or to the in-tensive care unit (n = 27). At admis-sion, patients had >1 of the following: diffuse pulmonary in ﬁ ltrates, room air oxygen saturation <95%, crackles on auscultation. Other clinical manifes-tations were not statistically different from those already reported in patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the United States, including cough, fever, and sore throat ( 3). The most common radiology pattern was basal, and bi-lateral interstitial in ﬁ ltrates were con- sistent with primary viral pneumonia. Notably, some patients had clinical radiologic dissociation characterized by cough and pulmonary in ﬁ ltrates in the absence of fever. Median time of hospitalization was 36 hours (range 1–25 days). No signi ﬁ cant differences were observed between the groups of patients that were admitted versus outpatients in terms of age, sex, num-ber of days from initiation of fever to ﬁ rst hospital visit, and history of inﬂ uenza vaccination. A total of 163 (98%) of 166 patients admitted to the hospital during the observation pe-riod were discharged with no further complications. 2060 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009

LETTERS Patients admitted to the hospital with pulmonary in ﬁ ltrates were em- pirically treated with high dose oselta-mivir (150 mg 2 ×/d) for 5 days, other antimicrobial drugs, and, eventually, steroids. In 2 patients, the respira-tory disease progressed initially but they eventually recovered; 2 patients (1.2% of admissions to hospital) with acute respiratory failure died. Despite improvement in clinical symptoms at discharge, chest radiographs per-formed on a limited number of pa-tients showed no substantial changes at 72–96 h after admission. Clinical manifestations of pan- demic (H1N1) 2009 have not yet been fully characterized. We observed a mild to moderate lower respiratory disease in ≈8% of consecutive patients with ILI during the current pandemic in Argentina. A more severe respira-tory disease was observed in Mexico during the current pandemic ( 4) In contrast, early reports indicated that pandemic (H1N1) 2009 disease might be similar in severity to seasonal in ﬂ u- enza ( 3). A lack of microbiologic con- ﬁ rmation may bias our observation. Because pulmonary in ﬁ ltrates are un- common in previously healthy persons with ILI, a simultaneous circulation of other respiratory pathogens may ex-plain our observation. Furthermore, early empirical use of antimicrobial drugs could overshadow clinical fea-tures of bacterial pneumonia. We observed an unexpectedly high rate of lower respiratory disease in adults with ILI during an outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Argenti-na. This ﬁ nding suggests that a unique pattern of virulence, pulmonary tro-pism, or both may characterize the current in ﬂ uenza A (H1N1) infection, although we could not rule out co-in-fection with other viral or bacterial re-spiratory pathogens. Considering the evolving nature of in ﬂ uenza viruses, the wide clinical spectrum of pan-demic (H1N1) 2009 should be further investigated.Carlos Zala and Roberto Gonzalez Author af ﬁ liation: Hospital Central de San Isidro, Buenos Aires, Argentina DOI: 10.3201/eid1512.091062 References Alerta epidemiologico situacion de in ﬂ u- enza A H1N1 [cited 2009 Sep 29].

By Au- gust 21, 2009, a total of >182,166 human cases, including 1,799 deaths, had been reported from 177 countries (www.who.int/csr/don/2009_08_21/ en/index.html). The origin of the new virus ap- pears to be a reassortant event of a virus from swine in North America that contained the classic swine, hu-man, and avian in ﬂ uenza genes and a virus of unknown origin that contrib-uted neuraminidase and matrix genes of swine in Europe. On May 2, 2009, the ﬁ rst nonhuman infections were de- tected in a swine operation in Canada (www.who.int/csr/don/2009_06_24/en/index.html). Historically, human seasonal in- ﬂ uenza A viruses have not been report- ed to infect poultry, but clinical cases of respiratory disease or reduction in egg production have been reported for domestic turkeys after infection with subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 swine in ﬂ uenza viruses and for mul- tiple poultry species with subtype H1N1 avian in ﬂ uenza virus ( 2–4). The presence of avian and swine in ﬂ u- enza virus genes in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus increases the potential for infection in poultry after exposure to infected humans or swine. To determine infectivity potential, 3-week-old chickens ( Gallus domes- ticus ) (n = 11), 2-week-old domestic ducks ( Anas platyrhynchos ) (n = 11), 73-week-old reproductively active turkey hens ( Meleagris gallopavo ) (n = 9), 3-week-old turkey poults (n = 11), and 5-week-old Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica ) (n = 11) were intranasally inoculated with 10 6 mean chicken embryo infectious doses of A/Mexico/4108/2009(H1N1). Five uninfected chickens, ducks, turkey poults, and quail, and 3 uninfected turkey hens were contact exposed to intranasally inoculated birds to as-sess transmission potential. Cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs were taken on 2, 4, 7, and 10 days postinocula-tion (DPI) from all birds, and internal tissues were taken from 2 birds on 2, 4 and 7 DPI for virus detection by quantitative real-time reverse tran-scription–PCR (qRRT-PCR) assay Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2061

LETTERS speci ﬁ c for the in ﬂ uenza virus matrix gene ( 5). To improve sensitivity because of several primer mismatches, we updated the reverse primer to 3 ′- CAGAGACTGGAAAGTGTCTTTGCA-5′. Virus isolation in embryonat- ing chicken eggs was used on a sub-set of samples to verify qRRT-PCR results at 4 DPI. Serum samples were collected on 15 DPI for antibody test-ing by hemagglutination inhibition. Shams were intranasally inoculated with culture media and sampled on 4 and/or 7 DPI. We inoculated ten 4 week-old chickens intravenously to determine pathotype by using the in-travenous pathogenicity index (IVPI). All animal studies were conducted un-der BioSafety Level 3 enhanced con-ditions with approval by Institutional Animal Care and Use and BioSafety committees. During the 15-day observation period, clinical signs did not develop in any of the birds; none of the birds died. An IVPI of 0.00 indicated the vi-rus was not of high pathogenicity for chickens. No virus was detected by qRRT-PCR or isolated in chicken eggs from swabs or tissues from chickens, turkeys, or ducks. All chickens and turkeys were negative for antibodies to the virus on 15 DPI, but 1 intranasally inoculated duck had a hemagglutina-tion inhibition (HI) antibody titer of 16. Virus was detected in oropharyn-geal swabs at 2 and 4 DPI from intra-nasally (IN)–inoculated quail (Table), and these quail had antibodies against inﬂ uenza A at 15 DPI. The intranasally inoculated quail had heterophilic-to-lymphocytic rhinitis, and in ﬂ uenza virus was visualized by immunohis-tochemical analysis of epithelium and macrophages within the mucosa of the nasal cavity; neither lesions nor anti-gen were identi ﬁ ed in other respira- tory and nonrespiratory tissues. Virus was not isolated from contact-exposed quail (Table), and they lacked antibod-ies on 15 DPI.Infection with swine in ﬂ uenza viruses in turkeys has been frequently reported, and experimental intrana-sal inoculation studies using 5 such viruses have produced infection and disease with associated contact trans-mission to uninfected turkeys ( 3,4,6 ). However, infection of chickens by swine in ﬂ uenza viruses has been rare in the ﬁ eld, and experimental studies have shown limited respiratory repli-cation after intranasal inoculation but no transmission ( 3,6–8 ). Experimental inoculation of ducks failed to produce infection or transmission ( 8). Recently, subtype H3N2 swine inﬂ uenza A virus infection with respi- ratory disease in Japanese quail has been reported in Canada, and such infections have been experimentally reproduced by intranasal inoculation (9,10). However, in our studies, pan- demic (H1N1) 2009 virus was bio-logically distinct from swine in ﬂ uenza viruses, failing to produce infection in experimentally inoculated turkey hens or chickens, and only 1 serologically positive IN-inoculated domestic duck. In addition, Japanese quail were in-fected by high dose IN exposure, but replication and shedding was limited to the respiratory tract, and the virus did not transmit to quail by contact, suggesting low potential of poultry in-volvement as an ampli ﬁ cation host for current pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus is un-likely to produce sustained outbreaks in poultry unless the virus mutates or reassorts with existing avian in ﬂ uenza viruses. Since the submission of this report, the virus has been detected in 2 turkey ﬂ ocks in Chile (www.oie. int/wahis,/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8404). Cur- rently, only limited data are available, and it is unknown if pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has changed and acquired the ability to infect and transmit in turkeys or if the 2 cases are isolated events without epidemic potential in turkeys.

Notably, this virus has adapted to an urban cycle involving man, with midges ( Culicoides paraen- sis) as the main vector ( 1). Oropouche fever is the second most frequent ar-boviral disease in Brazil, surpassed only by dengue. OROV causes large, explosive outbreaks of acute febrile illness in cities and villages in the Am-azon and central regions of Brazil. An estimated 500,000 cases of OROV in-fection have occurred in Brazil in the past 48 years. In addition to outbreaks, OROV can also cause sporadic human infections ( 2). The Tropical Medicine Founda- tion of Amazonas State (TMF-AM) is a tertiary care center specializing in tropical and infectious diseases and is located in the city of Manaus. Syn-dromic surveillance for acute febrile illness has been conducted by TMF-AM since 1998. During January 2007 through November 2008, we obtained blood samples from 631 patients who had acute febrile illness for ≥5 days but who had negative results at ini-tial screening for malaria (thick blood smear) and dengue (MAC-ELISA). Blood samples were tested for OROV immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies by an indirect enzyme immune assay us-ing infected cells as antigen, as previ-ously reported for dengue ( 3). For the indirect enzyme immune assay using infected cells as antigen, C6/36 A. albopictus cells were grown in 96 well microplates; these cells were infected with OROV (BeAn 1991 strain). After 4 days, the cells were ﬁ xed in the wells with 7% formalin buffered at pH 7.0. The microplate was blocked with 5% skim milk and, after washing the wells, 100 μL of serum diluted 1:400 was added into infected and uninfected wells. After incubation and washing the wells, a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgM was added; ﬁ nally, the ABTS substrate (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was added into the wells. The plates were incubated and read on a spec-trophotometer at 405 nm. The cutoff for the test was determined to be the mean of optical densities read in all wells containing uninfected cells plus 3 standard deviations. Of the 631 patients in the study, 128 (20.3%) had IgM antibodies to OROV . The age range was 2–81 years (mean 29.5 ± 14 years), and 77 (60.2%) were women or girls. Most of the cas-es occurred November through March during the rainy season. In addition to fever, the patients had headache (93 [72.7%]), myalgia (90 [70.3%]), and arthralgia (74 [57.8%]). Rash was observed in 54 patients (42.2%), and hemorrhagic phenomena (petechiae, epistaxis, and gingival bleeding) were observed in 20 patients (15.5%). All patients recovered without sequelae and were not hospitalized. Despite the knowledge of the oc- currence of several arboviruses in the Amazon region, most cases of arbo-viral diseases remain undiagnosed, probably because of their generally mild and self-limited clinical mani-festations. Patients usually recover completely after a couple of days. However, even more severe cases may remain undiagnosed, especially because of long distances to health care facilities, dif ﬁ culties in sample transportation, and lack of laboratory facilities capable of conducting the di-agnostic assays. With regard to OROV infections, diagnosis of OROV may be easily confused with other acute febrile illness, including malaria and dengue, both of which are highly en-demic in Manaus. In the present study, an inhouse enzyme immune assay for IgM using infected cell culture as antigen was Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2063 The opinions expressed by authors contributing to this journal do not necessarily re ﬂ ect the opinions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the institutions with which the authors are af ﬁ liated.

LETTERS found suitable for the diagnosis of OROV infections in the acute phase. Thus, a combination of a systematic surveillance for acute febrile illnesses and ef ﬁ cient laboratory diagnosis for OROV resulted in the discovery of an outbreak, which would probably have been overlooked if it had occurred in any region simultaneously with large dengue outbreaks or in the absence of laboratory diagnosis. The cases of OROV fever reported here likely rep-resent a small portion of the cases; a much higher number of cases prob-ably occurred in Manaus during the study period. The clinical characteristics of most cases of OROV fever in this outbreak were similar to previously reported descriptions of the illness. Notably, however, 20 (15.5%) pa-tients from Manaus had spontaneous hemorrhagic phenomena (petecchiae, epistaxis, and gingival bleeding) that had not previously been described in OROV fever ( 4–6). Moreover, symp- toms of involvement of the central nervous system were not observed. In recent years, the area of cir- culation and the epidemic potential of OROV have increased, and this virus has emerged as a public health problem in Brazil and other countries in the Americas. Presently, OROV is the most common of the Brazilian zoonotic arboviruses infecting humans (7). Further evidence of the spread of OROV was its isolation in 2003 from a small primate, a marmoset ( Cal- lithrix ), in the state of Minas Gerais in southeast Brazil, far from the Amazon region ( 8). Considering that midges (Culicoides paraensis ) occur in most low altitude areas of the Americas, it is conceivable that environmental de-struction and climate changes could result in OROV outbreaks in the large cities of Brazil, as well as in other parts of the Western Hemisphere ( 9).

A thorough investigation and necropsy identi ﬁ ed the probable cause of death to be a spirochete in-fection. The organisms were seen in sections of the bird’s liver with use of modiﬁ ed Steiner silver stain and mi- croscopy. DNA was extracted from the infected liver, and PCR–DNA se-quencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) locus identi ﬁ ed the bacterium as a relapsing fever spirochete related most closely to Borrelia hermsii (1). The lack of additional data surround-ing this case precluded Thomas et al. from concluding that this spirochete 2064 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009

LETTERS infecting the owl was B. hermsii (1). Yet, in a subsequent analysis using the intergenic spacer region, the owl spi-rochete was included with isolates of B. hermsii (2). To investigate the distribution and prevalence of B. hermsii , during the summer of 2008, we began a study at Flathead Lake, Lake County, Montana, USA, where 9 persons have contract-ed relapsing fever since 2002 ( 3–5). A blood smear from 1 pine squirrel ( Ta- miasciurus hudsonicus ) captured July 9 at Yellow Bay on the east shore of the lake (elevation 887 m; geographic co-ordinates 47°52 ′35′′N, 114°01 ′54′′W) contained spirochetes detected when stained with Giemsa and examined by microscopy (600× bright ﬁ eld with oil immersion). Whole blood from the squirrel contained live spirochetes vis-ible by dark- ﬁ eld microscopy, and ≈50 μL of this blood was injected intrap- eritoneally into a laboratory mouse. The next day, a few spirochetes were observed in the peripheral blood of the mouse, and during the next 3 days, the density of spirochetes increased. We used intracardiac puncture to collect blood from the mouse for spirochete isolation in BSK-H medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and for analysis by PCR and DNA sequencing of multiple bacterial loci as described elsewhere ( 4,6). The spirochetes observed in the squirrel’s blood failed to grow in BSK-H medium after passage in the laboratory mouse; however, we ac-quired DNA sequences from infected squirrel and mouse blood from PCR amplicons for 6 spirochete loci in-cluding 16S rDNA , ﬂ aB, gyrB , glpQ , IGS, and vtp. Sequences for the loci were each aligned with homologous sequences from other borrelia in our collection, and each locus grouped the spirochete within the 2 genomic groups of B. hermsii described previ- ously ( 4,6). The unique squirrel spiro- chete differed from all other B. hermsii identi ﬁ ed in our previous studies; deep branches in each phylogram grouped the spirochete more closely with B. hermsii genomic group I than with ge- nomic group II (data not shown). Next, we compared the sequenc- es from the squirrel spirochete with those available in the National Cen-ter for Biotechnology Information database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) , including those sequences reported for the spirochete found in the spot-ted owl (AY515269.1, AF116903.1, AF116904.1) ( 1,2). The 3 trimmed and aligned sequences for the 16S rDNA (1,290 bases), ﬂ aB (467 bas- es), and IGS (665 bases) from the squirrel spirochete were identical to those of the owl spirochete; no base differences were found among the 2,422 bases compared. We also examined DNA extracted from the spotted owl’s liver during the ﬁ rst in-vestigation ( 1 ) (provided by Alan G. Barbour). We successfully PCR am-pliﬁ ed most of the 16S rDNA and the complete ﬂ aB, gyrB , glpQ, and vtp genes from the owl spirochete DNA and determined their sequences. The complete sequences of the ﬁ rst 4 loci from the owl and squirrel spirochetes were identical and differed from all other B. hermsii sequences. A phylo- gram of the concatenated sequences totaling 5,188 bases demonstrated that the owl and pine squirrel spiro-chetes were identical and were diver-gent members of B. hermsii genomic group I (Figure). Finding the same strain of B. hermsii , separated by ≈525 km, in a pine squirrel and a spotted owl demon-strates a broader geographic distribu-tion and host range for this spirochete than what could have been envisaged previously. The possible role of birds as hosts for the vector Ornithodoros hermsi ticks has been demonstrated elsewhere ( 4). Given the ecologic overlap of pine squirrels and conifer-ous forest-dwelling birds, we believe that the previous ﬁ nding of the infect- ed spotted owl is likely not an isolated event. Instead, it may represent a tick–spirochete cycle for B. hermsii that includes a broader host range for this group of relapsing fever spirochetes than previously appreciated.

Livestock owners in Nigeria normally graze cattle and goats together, and this practice poses a high risk for transmission of bovine TB among these animals ( 1). This practice is especially a threat to goats in Nigeria because several reports have described bovine TB in cattle in Nigeria ( 2–5). However, reports of diagnosis of TB in goats in Nigeria are lacking. Molecular epidemiologic tech- niques such as deletion typing and spoligotyping have been used to char-acterize members of the Mycobac- terium tuberculosis complex (MTC) and to provide information on trans-mission of mycobacterial diseases be-tween animals and humans ( 6). How- ever, because of limited resources and lack of expertise, these techniques are not commonly used in most develop-ing nations such as Nigeria, where TB is endemic ( 3). Because slaughterhouses provide excellent opportunities for detect-ing diseases of economic and public health importance, we investigated the presence of mycobacteria in slaugh-tered goats with lesions suggestive of TB. The investigation was conducted at the Bodija Municipal Abattoir in Ibadan in southwestern Nigeria over a period of 6 months. Slaughtered goats were obtained from local herds and herds in northern Nigeria. A total of 10,389 male and female goats of 2 breeds (West African Dwarf and Red Sokoto) and 1–2 years of age were slaughtered; 1,387 were inspected for gross lesions of TB. Of 1,387 animals screened, 62 (4.47%) had lesions suggestive of TB in the liver, lungs, and mesenter- ic lymph nodes. Five (0.36%) goats were con ﬁ rmed positive by culture as described ( 2). Deletion typing ( 6) with the RD9 deletion was used to distinguish M. tuberculosis from other members of the MTC. Those isolates with a deletion in this region were fur-ther investigated with primers speci ﬁ c for RD4. This reaction distinguishes between M. bovis , M. caprae , and oth- er members of the MTC. Spoligotyp-ing was performed as described ( 7) to type an M. tuberculosis isolate from a goat after identi ﬁ cation of this bacte- rium by deletion typing. We isolated 4 strains of M. bovis and 1 strain of M. tuberculosis from the goats (Table). Spoligotyping identi ﬁ ed the M. tuberculosis isolate as belonging to the East African In-dian (EAI)–5 family in the SpolDB4 database. All M. bovis isolates were M. bovis bovis , not M. bovis caprae , according to their deletion typing proﬁ le ( 6). One M. bovis isolate was obtained from a male goat; the 3 re-maining M. bovis isolates and the M. tuberculosis isolate were obtained from female goats. Epidemiologic inferences can be made from the results of our study. First, M. bovis , which is naturally found in cattle, was isolated from 4 slaughtered goats. Although M. bo- vis caprae was the M. bovis variant most frequently isolated from goats in some areas ( 8), in our study, only M. bovis bovis was isolated. This ﬁ nd- ing is consistent with results reported by Crawshaw et al. ( 9), and suggests transmission from cattle, rather than transmission from the goat reservoir. Second, because the infected goats were adult females, infection may be transmitted to their offspring. Third, M. tuberculosis was isolated from a goat. Its presence in this goat may have been caused by direct transmission from hu-mans because this bacterium may be a natural pathogen of humans.

LETTERS with advanced TB may occur, given the endemic nature of TB in humans in Nigeria ( 10). TB cases caused by EAI strains have been found in hu-mans in southwestern Nigeria ( 4; S.I. Cadmus et al., unpub. data), a ﬁ nding that supports zoonotic transmission of this organism from humans to goats. However, different lineages of M. tu- berculosis may vary in host range, and EAI genotype strains may be adapted to human and animal hosts. Converse-ly, human-to-animal transmission of M. tuberculosis has been reported in Nigeria relative to infection in cattle (3,4). Thus, con ﬁ rmation of TB in goats supports the possibility of risk for TB transmission between humans and animals in Nigeria. This study should be interpreted in the context of its limitations. Be-cause the sources of the animals were unknown, we could not determine whether the organisms were imported from a neighboring country ( 3). In ad- dition, we lacked information on the breed and condition of the animals. However, we have identi ﬁ ed M. tu- berculosis and TB in goats in Nigeria. Additional studies of other slaughter-houses in Nigeria are needed to con-ﬁ rm our results. Acknowledgments We thank the students at the abbatoir for assistance during meat inspection.

S. suis is in emergence in some Asian countries. Indeed, this pathogen has been described as the most and second-most common cause of adult meningitis in Vietnam and Thailand, respectively ( 2,3). Moreover, during an outbreak in People’s Repub-lic of China in 2005, 39 of 215 patients died from S. suis diseases ( 4). On the other hand, only 2 human S. suis cases have been reported in the United States (5,6). Here, we describe a ﬁ rst case of human S. suis meningitis in Hawaii. The patient, a 34-year-old Ton- gan male with no medical history who worked as a coconut tree trimmer, was singing in his church choir when he developed an acute-onset, global headache and emesis. Upon hospital admission, he described a week of Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2067 Table.

LETTERS antecedent nonspeci ﬁ c symptoms for which he had taken nonsteroidal anti-inﬂ ammatory drugs without relief. On examination, he was afe- brile, tired-appearing but alert, and with stable vital signs. He presented mild meningismus and photophobia; no rash was observed. Blood tests showed 27,600 leukocytes/ μL with 65% neutrophils; 168,000 platelets/μL; hemoglobin 17.3 g/dL; and crea- tinine 1.4 mg/dL. A computed tomog-raphy scan of the head was read as showing substantial motion artifact and a possible cerebral mass. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed no mass, but T2-weighted images (postgadolinium) suggested both increased grey/white matter contrast consistent with dif-fuse cortical edema, and vascular congestion/in ﬂ ammation of the sulci. Cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) ob- tained from a lumbar puncture had 2,770 leukocytes/ μL with 94% neu- trophils; glucose 30 mg/dL; and pro-tein 230 mg/L. A Gram stain of the CSF showed numerous gram-positive cocci, mostly in pairs and short chains (Figure). Empiric intravenous therapy with dexamethasone, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone was administered for possible pneumococcal meningitis. Blood cultures grew a Strepto- coccus species, later identi ﬁ ed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as being S. suis , sensitive to penicillin, vanco- mycin, and ceftriaxone. The isolate was assigned to serotype 2 by the coagglutination test ( 7) and shown by Western blot to produce suilysin, extracellular protein factor and mu-ramidase-released protein, which are virulence markers often associated with highly virulent strains of Eur-asian, but not North American, origin (1,8). A strain of this phenotype was responsible for a previous US S. suis meningitis case, but the patient had been infected in the Philippines ( 5; unpub. data). Upon identi ﬁ cation of the S. suis isolate, the patient was questioned about swine contact. He described slaughtering by hand several noncom-mercially raised pigs over the preced-ing several weeks for a church-related luau. The patient did not recall any clear incident of mucosal exposure to pig blood or secretions. The exact route of S. suis infection for humans is not known. However, most cases have been linked to accidental inocu-lation through skin injuries ( 1). The patient did not wear gloves, masks, or any other protective equipment dur-ing the prolonged process of butcher-ing the pigs, and his exposure to pig blood, skin, and internal organs was extensive. He sustained multiple small cuts on his hands during butchering. No other church members who par-ticipated in preparing pigs for the luau became ill. The patient was treated with cef- triaxone and a 4-day course of dex-amathasone. His headache and menin-gismus improved progressively, and he was discharged after 6 days to complete a 2-week course of intravenous ceftri-axone. However, 1 day after discharge, the patient complained of headaches and mild-to-moderate bilateral hear- ing loss. He was readmitted; a repeat lumbar puncture showed resolving CSF pleocytosis, and an MRI showed that his prior radiographic ﬁ ndings had normalized. The symptoms, attributed to residual meningeal/cerebral edema, resolved quickly after the reintroduc-tion of steroids. Audiometric testing suggested mild sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear. The patient com-pleted the remainder of his intravenous ceftriaxone course and was discharged on a 2-week course of amoxicillin and oral steroids. He was again admitted 2 days after completing treatment, with dis-abling dizziness. On exam he showed new torsional nystagmus, more pro-nounced with left lateral gaze, consis-tent with a right peripheral vestibul-opathy. An MRI of the head was again normal. Oral dexamethasone promptly resolved his vestibulopathy, and the patient was discharged on a slow ste-roid taper. After a month, dexametha-sone was discontinued. The patient has been asymptomatic since, and his hearing loss has resolved fully. 2068 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 Figure.

LETTERS The role of steroids in treating patients with S. suis infection remains unclear, although this case illustrates that the in ﬂ ammation associated with this infection can be profound and can require prolonged steroid therapy. Since at least 2 cases of relapse have been reported after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment ( 1), prolonged therapy should be considered for infections caused by this pathogen. Hearing loss from S. suis meningitis occurs fre- quently and can be irreversible ( 1). Hawaii’s swine industry is character-ized by small herds and a high degree of concentration ( 9). This case of human S. suis meningitis in Hawaii emphasizes the need for these data to be generated and made available. Indeed, this bacterium is increasingly recognized as a signi ﬁ cant zoonotic agent in Asia; although it remains a relatively rare cause of human infec-tion elsewhere, persons in close oc-cupational contact with pigs or pork products are at higher risk than others (1). Increasing awareness of this dis- ease is expected to help counter hu-man S. suis infections.

In the context of the rising incidence of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infec-tions ( 6), we report an apparent case of CA-MRSA chorioamnionitis. The patient, a 31-year-old woman with polycystic ovary syndrome and hypothyroidism, had 1 prior preg-nancy but no viable offspring. After a clomiphene-assisted conception, rou-tine ultrasound at 21 weeks’ gestation identi ﬁ ed a shortened cervix (5 mm). The patient declined amniocentesis for cerclage and was treated with pel-vic rest and vaginal progesterone. Five days later, she arrived at the emergency department with foul-smelling vaginal discharge. At this time, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable, had no abdominal pain, and had a leu-kocyte count of 9.5 × 10 3 cells/mm3. Premature rupture of membranes was diagnosed, and the patient was admitted and administered intrave-nous ampicillin and azithromycin. Nine days into treatment, at 23 weeks’ gestation, 210 hours after membrane rupture, a 415-g live-born girl was delivered spontaneously in footling breech with Apgar scores of 1 (1 min) and 5 (5 min). During admission, the mother was never febrile and did not complain of abdominal tenderness or chills. The highest leukocyte count was 12.4 × 10 3 cells/mm3. The mother was discharged the day after deliv-ery without further complications. At 6-week follow-up, she remained well, with no signs of infection.

LETTERS Pathologic examination of the pla- centa demonstrated focal acute funisi-tis, acute chorioamnionitis with fetal surface acute arteritis and acute deci-duitis. Cultures from the maternal and fetal sides of the placenta grew pre-dominantly MRSA and rare colonies of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus . The MRSA antimicrobial drug pro ﬁ le, including trimethoprim/sulfamethox-azole and clindamycin susceptibility, was characteristic of CA-MRSA ( 6). The neonate, who died on day 16, was culture-positive for CA-MRSA from blood, 2 umbilical swabs, and a tracheal aspirate. The antibiogram of these isolates was identical to the placental cultures, including absence of inducible clindamycin resistance. Postmortem examination showed hemorrhagic necrotizing pneumonia and gram-negative bacilli. Culture of lung tissue grew Escherichia coli . Isolates from the placenta and neonate were identi ﬁ ed phenotypically, with- out molecular testing. Maternal complications of cho- rioamnionitis include endometritis, bacteremia, hemorrhage, and cesarean delivery ( 1). Clinically, chorioamni- onitis can be diagnosed by maternal fever (>38 oC) and 2 of the following: maternal leukocytosis (>15 × 103cells/ mm3), maternal tachycardia (>100 bpm), fetal tachycardia (>160 bpm), uterine tenderness, and foul-smelling amniotic ﬂ uid ( 1). This patient had none of these signs, except foul-smell-ing amniotic ﬂ uid, and fetal tachycar- dia was absent. In this case, chorioam-nionitis was diagnosed by histology. Amniotic ﬂ uid cultures from pregnancies complicated by chorio-amnionitis have shown multiple or-ganisms from the vaginal ﬂ ora, such as Streptococcus agalactiae , Gardner- ella vaginalis , Mycoplasma hominis , Ureaplasma urealyticum , anaerobes, and E. coli (1). Chorioamnionitis as- sociated with S. aureus is uncommon (2,3), and MRSA chorioamnionitis is rare ( 4,5). The ﬁ rst 2 reports of MRSA chorioamnionitis appeared in 1998 (4) and 2002 ( 5). In both instances, the patients worked in the healthcare industry, and the authors considered the MRSA to have been nosocomial strains. The patient in our report was a restaurant manager, had no prior re-corded hospital admissions, and was not previously known to be colonized by MRSA. CA-MRSA strains are epide- miologically and clonally unrelated to hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) strains and can be differ-entiated by the presence of staphy-lococcal cassette chromosome mec type IV and the absence of multidrug resistance seen with HA-MRSA ( 6). Recently, the incidence of CA-MR-SA infections increased in commu-nity settings, including outbreaks in settings in which CA-MRSA is en-demic, with manifestations ranging from skin and soft tissue infections to necrotizing pneumonia ( 6). Geni- tal colonization with MRSA recently has been reported with a frequency of 0.5%–3.5% in pregnant women ( 7,8). In 1 study, most (93%) of these iso-lates were CA-MRSA ( 7). Eckhardt et al. described a pa- tient with chorioamnionitis in whom CA-MRSA bacteremia developed ( 9). However, this descriptor was used to specify multidrug-resistant MRSA not acquired in a hospital. Moreover, neither placental nor amniotic ﬂ uid cultures were described. Laibl et al. reported 2 patients with CA-MRSA infections in whom chorioamnionitis developed ( 10). Again, placental and amniotic ﬂ uid culture results were not reported, nor was chorioamni-onitis listed as an infection caused by CA-MRSA in their cohort. However, these latter 2 patients might repre-sent additional cases of CA-MRSA chorioamnionitis. Although the incidence of CA- MRSA infections continues to in-crease, CA-MRSA chorioamnionitis appears to remain rare. Nevertheless, the prevalence of MRSA genital colo-nization among pregnant women cre-ates an opportunity for this agent to cause ascending gestational infection. This ﬁ nding is meaningful because recommended empirical antimicro-bial drug treatments may not cover CA-MRSA, increasing the likelihood of infectious complications ( 1). How- ever, culture results when available can provide therapeutic guidance. We hope this report raises awareness of the possibility of CA-MRSA cho-rioamnionitis and encourages reports from other authors so this entity can be better established, characterized, and monitored.

However, to date, only 2 studies have reported the isolation of MRSA from marine mammals, 1 seal (1) and 3 bottlenose dolphins ( 2). We describe an investigation that was con-ducted after MRSA was isolated from a dolphin at a marine park in North America. In November 2006, a 20-year- old, male, captive, bottlenose dolphin, suspected of having pneumonia, was treated empirically with cipro ﬂ oxacin and itraconazole. Despite treatment, the dolphin died in December 2006. A necropsy was performed, and a culture swab specimen of the blowhole was submitted for bacteriologic examina-tion; MRSA was then isolated. The clinical relevance of this ﬁ nding was unclear. Pulsed- ﬁ eld gel electropho- resis (PFGE) was conducted ( 3), and results indicated that the MRSA strain isolated was the Canadian epidemic MRSA (CMRSA)2 (USA100) strain, the predominant hospital- and com-munity-associated MRSA strain found in persons in Canada ( 4). To determine the extent of MRSA colonization in this marine park, blowhole swab spec-imens were collected from dolphins, orcas, and beluga whales, and nasal swab specimens were collected from walruses, sea lions, harbor seals, gray seals, and park personnel, excluding 4 employees in January 2007. Selective culture for MRSA was performed, and strains were typed with PFGE ( 3) and spa typing ( 5). All MRSA strains were investigated for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin genes ( 6). In January 2007, MRSA was not isolated from personnel (0/22), sea lions (0/12), harbor seals (0/2), gray seals (0/2), orcas (0/4), or beluga whales (0/23); it was isolated from dol-phins (2/6, 33.3%) and a walrus (1/6, 16.7%). To reduce the risk for MRSA transmission among the marine mam-mals and to personnel, the following steps were recommended: colonized animals were isolated, contact with colonized animals was restricted, all park personnel were required to wear gloves and masks when handling colonized animals, and routine hand hygiene was emphasized. Colonized walruses were isolated in a separate facility until May 2007. Because of space limitations, colonized dolphins could not be isolated. Although the park instituted a strict policy that re-quired personnel to wear gloves and masks, this policy ceased during the summer months due to the park’s ex-hibition schedule. Because we knew from our ob- servations of other animal species that natural decolonization with MRSA is common, as well as lacking informa-tion about antimicrobial drug ef ﬁ cacy for MRSA decolonization in marine mammals, and had concerns regarding the emergence of further antimicrobial drug resistance, we recommended that no attempt be made to decolonize the animals with antimicrobial agents. Af-ter these recommendations were made and implemented, follow-up testing for MRSA colonization was performed on the dolphins and walruses through-out 2007 and 2008 (Table). In Octo-ber 2007, testing conducted on all sea lions, harbor seals, gray seals, orcas, Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2071 Table.

LETTERS and beluga whales showed that none of these animals were colonized with MRSA. Overall, MRSA was isolated on >1 occasions from 5 dolphins (n = 6, 83.3%) and 3 walruses (n = 6, 50%) (Table). All strains were indistinguish-able on PFGE and were consistent with the CMRSA2 (USA100) strain. They were also spa type t002 and did not possess the PVL toxin genes. This report of MRSA shows colonization in several dolphins and walruses, with apparent transmis-sion between species. The direction of transmission cannot be determined because of the sampling method; how-ever, a human origin is suspected be-cause the clone that was isolated is a predominant human clone. The failure to identify a concurrently colonized person does not preclude a human source. Since the time MRSA was in-troduced into the facility is unknown, the source of infection may have been decolonized by the time of sampling or was not sampled. Furthermore, park visitors occasionally have con-tact with these animals so the origin could have been from the general pub-lic. Whether colonization of multiple animals was due to repeated instances of human-to-animal transmission or whether animal-to-animal transmis-sion may have occurred is not clear. For the dolphins, the second scenario is most likely, considering the social nature of these animals and the in-ability to isolate colonized dolphins. These factors may have resulted in the circulation of MRSA among these ani-mals. Although no water samples were obtained for testing, waterborne trans-mission cannot be dismissed. Colonization was eliminated without antimicrobial agents; how-ever, long-term (15 months) MRSA colonization was found in 1 dolphin. With patience and continued use of infection control measures, MRSA was apparently eradicated from this facility without the need for active decolonization. This study shows the impressive ability of MRSA to colo- nize diverse animal species and pro-vides further evidence suggesting that interspecies transmission of human epidemic clones can occur between persons and animals. This study also provides evidence suggesting that MRSA colonization in many animal species can be transient and that appli-cation of appropriate infection control and hygiene measures may be critical control tools for the management of MRSA in animals.

The family Rhabdochlamydiaceae includes R. por- cellionis (a parasite of Porcellio scab- er) and R. crassi ﬁ cans (a pathogen of the cockroach Blatta orientalis ) (2,3); their pathogenic role in humans has not yet been investigated. Parachlamydia acanthamoebae and Protochlamydia naegleriophila belong to the family Parachlamydiaceae (1,4). Increasing evidence indicates that these obligate intracellular bacteria infecting free-living amebae may cause respiratory diseases in humans ( 1). Recent ﬁ ndings also suggest a role for Parachlamydia in miscarriage, stillbirth, and preterm labor ( 5–7). Whether these bacteria may contaminate the newborns of in-fected mothers is unknown. The aims of this study were to 1) develop a real-time PCR for de-tecting Rhabdochlamydia spp. and 2) 2072 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009

LETTERS apply this PCR, and those previously described for Parachlamydia and Pro- tochlamydia (4,8), to respiratory sam- ples from premature neonates. Using the GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), we selected primers RcF (5 ′- GACGCTGCGTGAGTGATGA-3 ′) and RcR (5 ′-CCGGTGCTTCTTT ACGCAGTA-3 ′), and probe RcS (5 ′-6 carboxy ﬂ uorescein-CTTTCGGGTT- GTAAAACTCTTTCGCGCA-Black Hole Quencher 1-3 ′), which amplify parts of the 16S rRNA encoding gene, to speci ﬁ cally amplify Rhabdochla- mydia spp. The 5 ′-FAM probe (Euro- gentec, Seraing, Belgium) contained locked nucleic acids (underlined) to improve speci ﬁ city. Reactions were performed with 0.2 μM of each primer, 1 μM of probe, and iTaq Supermix (Bio-Rad, Rheinach, Switzerland). PCR products were detected with ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Inhibition, negative PCR mixture, and extraction controls were systematically tested. To enable quanti ﬁ cation, a plasmid containing the target gene was con-structed as described ( 4,9). The analyti- cal sensitivity of the real-time PCR for Rhabdochlamydia spp. was <10 copies DNA/μL. No cross-ampli ﬁ cation was observed when the analytical speci ﬁ city was tested with human, amebal ( Acan-thamoeba castellanii ATCC 30010), and bacterial DNA (online Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc. gov/EID/content/15/12/2072-Techapp.pdf). Intrarun and interrun reproduc-ibility were excellent (online Technical Appendix). This PCR and those previously described for Parachlamydia and Pro- tochlamydia (4,8) were retrospectively applied to 39 respiratory samples from 29 neonates admitted in the neonatol-ogy unit of our institution (median 1 sample per patient, range 1–4 sample). All but 1 patient had a gestational age at birth <36 weeks (median 28.6, range 24.6–41.2 weeks).

LETTERS distress syndrome was present in 25 (86%) of these 29 neonates. Samples had been drawn a median of 14 days (range 1–229 days) after birth, when clinically indicated. Results of PCR for Parachlamydia , Protochlamydia , and Rhabdochlamydia were positive for 9 (31%), 0 (0%), and 4 (14%) neonates, respectively. Positive results were ob-tained on the ﬁ rst sample drawn after birth for all but 2 neonates (initial nega-tive results). One patient had positive PCR results for Parachlamydia and Rhabdochlamydia . These 12 newborns with positive PCR results for Parachla- mydia and/or Rhabdochlamydia were compared with the 17 who had nega-tive PCR results (Table). Newborns with a Chlamydia -relat- ed organism documented in the respira-tory tract had a signi ﬁ cantly worse pri- mary adaptation score (Apgar). These patients experienced more resuscitation maneuvers at birth. Durations of inva-sive mechanical ventilation and hospi-tal stay were also longer among them. Three newborns died, compared with no deaths among the 17 with negative PCR results (p = 0.06). Pneumonia was documented in 5 of the 12 patients with positive Parachlamydia and/or Rhabdochlamydia PCR results but was concomitant to PCR positivity for only 3 of them. An alternative etiology was documented in all 3 (online Technical Appendix). Parachlamydia and Rhabdochla- mydia have thus been detected in a population of premature neonates. Most of these patients had severe respiratory distress syndrome, and the role of these bacteria as a causal agent of pneumonia could not be clearly assessed. The lon-ger duration of mechanical ventilation for newborns with positive PCR results may suggest an occult superinfection with a Chlamydia -related bacterium contributing to the severity of the initial respiratory disease. Our results also raise a ques- tion about the mode of acquisition of these microorganisms. A recent study reported a higher seroprevalence of Parachlamydia in women experienc- ing miscarriage ( 5,6), and DNA of this bacterium has been detected in the am-niotic ﬂ uid of a woman with premature delivery ( 7). Whether neonatal infec- tion results from a systemic infection during pregnancy or an inoculation at delivery is unknown. Because of the retrospective design of the study, no samples from the mothers were avail-able for additional molecular or sero-logic analyses. Hospital water supplies are an important reservoir of free-liv-ing amebae and may represent another mode of acquisition because patients undergoing mechanical ventilation are exposed to aerosolized particles ( 10). Simultaneous detection of Parachla-mydia and Rhabdochlamydia in 2 pa-tients with initial negative results and their simultaneous detection in 1 neo-nate supports the latter hypothesis. In conclusion, Parachlamydia and Rhabdochlamydia DNA were detected in respiratory secretions of premature newborns with more severe conditions at birth, more mechanical ventilation requirements, and a trend toward a higher mortality rate. The pathogenic role of these Chlamydia - related bacteria in neonates deserves further investigations. This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation grant FN 32003B-116445.

Aichi virus has been shown to be associated with acute gastroenteritis in humans ( 2–4), and bovine kobuvirus has been detect-ed only in cattle ( 5,6). Most recently, a third candidate species of Kobuvirus has been described in pigs by 2 dif-ferent groups of investigators from Hungary and the People’s Republic of China ( 7,8). This new candidate spe- cies was serendipitously recognized in stool specimens from pigs when PCR products ( ≈1,100 bp) were ampli ﬁ ed by using a primer pair for the detec-tion of caliciviruses ( 7). Nucleotide sequences of these nonspeci ﬁ c PCR products were simi- lar to those of the U-1 bovine kobuvi-rus and Aichi virus A846/88 reference strains; sequence identities ranged from 73% to 79% at the nucleotide level and from 69% to 70% at the amino acid ( 7). The representative strain of a new candidate species of porcine kobuvirus, S-1-HUN (Por-cine kobuvirus/swine/S-1-HUN/2007/Hungary), has been analyzed to deter-mine its complete genome sequence and genetic organization ( 9). The RNA genome of the S-1-HUN strain comprises 8,210 nt, with a genome organization analogous to that of pi-cornaviruses. Therefore, this strain is tentatively classi ﬁ ed as a new species of the genus Kobuvirus , and named porcine kobuvirus ( 7,9). Currently, 2 reports have de- scribed the epidemiologic feature of porcine kobuvirus in healthy piglets. Thirty-nine (65%) of 60 stool samples collected from pigs in Hungary were positive for porcine kobuvirus by re-verse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) (9). Another report from China found that the prevalence of porcine kobuvi-rus was 30% (97 of 322 piglets) ( 8). These ﬁ ndings suggested that porcine kobuvirus infections are common in piglets. However, whether this agent is associated with particular diseases, including gastroenteritis, in piglets was not clear. We conducted an epidemiologic survey of porcine kobuvirus and report the detection of this virus in the stool specimens of piglets with diarrhea. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the porcine kobuvirus strains were carried out to determine their evolu-tionary relationships with kobuvirus strains previously reported. A total of 98 stool specimens were collected from piglets with diarrhea from 6 farms in Chiang Mai Province, Thailand, during 2001–2003. Age of the piglets ranged from 7 to 49 days old. Porcine kobuvirus was detected in fecal specimens by RT-PCR ( 9). The representative strains of porcine kobuvirus detected in our study were analyzed further by direct sequenc-ing of their PCR amplicons (216 bp) by using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences of these fragments were compared with those of reference strains available in the NCBI GenBank database by using BLAST server (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted by using MEGA 4 ( 10). Nucleotide sequences of porcine ko-buvirus strains described in this study were deposited in GenBank under ac-cession nos. GQ152093–GQ152122.Prevalence of porcine kobuvirus was exceptionally high in piglets with diarrhea, 99% (97 of 98 specimens). Thirty representative strains of por-cine kobuvirus detected in this study were randomly selected, sequenced, and analyzed to determine their evolu-tionary relationships with other kobu-virus reference strains. The partial 3D region among all 30 porcine kobuvi-rus strains was highly conserved, with nucleotide sequence identities >90%. In addition, our strains were most closely related to 2 porcine kobuvi-rus reference strains (S-1-HUN and Swine/2007/CHN) available in Gen-Bank, with the nucleotide sequence identity ranging from 91.5% to 96.3%. Phylogenetic analysis of partial 3D nucleotide sequences of our porcine kobuvirus strains, together with pub-lished sequences of porcine kobuvirus reference strains (and those of Aichi virus and bovine kobuvirus), is shown in the Figure. The phylogenetic tree conﬁ rmed that all strains we identi- ﬁ ed belonged to the porcine kobuvi- rus species and formed a tight cluster in a monophyletic branch with the other 2 porcine kobuvirus reference strains (S-1-HUN and Swine/2007/CHN). These strains are also distantly related to standard strains of Aichi vi-rus and bovine kobuvirus. Recently, 18 sequences of partial 3D region of the porcine kobuvirus strains detect-ed in China have been deposited in GenBank. Unfortunately, the speci ﬁ c position of PCR ampli ﬁ cation of the strains found in China was different from that of our strains ( 8). Therefore, the relationship between these strains could not be analyzed. Porcine kobuviruses have previ- ously been reported only in healthy pigs ( 7 –9). In our study, the excep- tionally high prevalence of porcine kobuviruses (99%) has been observed in piglets with acute gastroenteritis; those samples were negative for rotavi-rus infection as determined previously by RT-PCR. However, associations of this agent with enteric diseases in pigs Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2075

LETTERS remains unclear because no data were available that tested for porcine kobu-virus in pigs without gastroenteritis from the farms in the same area. In ad-dition, infection with other pathogens that may cause diarrhea in pigs, such as bacteria or other porcine caliciviruses, needs to be ruled out. Further extensive epidemiologic surveillance and com-prehensive characterization of porcine kobuvirus strains from other areas may help clarify the distribution, heteroge-neity, and association of porcine kobu-viruses with enteric diseases in pigs.

LETTERS Rickettsia slovaca in Dermacentor marginatus ticks, Germany To the Editor: Dermacentor spp. ticks are found in many countries in Europe, and are vectors for several pathogens, including Francisella tu- larensis , Coxiella burnetii , Rickettsia spp., and Babesia canis (1,2). Be- cause Dermacentor marginatus ticks require warm dry habitats, these ticks are found in only a few areas in south-ern Germany, mainly in the Rhine and Main valleys ( 3). However, these ticks may spread northwards because of in-creasing temperatures. In contrast, D. reticulatus ticks are present through- out Germany. Fourteen Rickettsia spp. are cur- rently identi ﬁ ed as human pathogens. The severity of human diseases differs among these species, ranging from mild to lethal illness ( 4). On the basis of serologic and genotypical charac-teristics, rickettsiae are divided into ty-phus and spotted fever groups. Within each group, antigenic differences are small, resulting in cross-reactivity that complicates differentiation of Rickett- sia spp. by serologic methods. There- fore, PCR of eschar biopsy samples is a useful tool for diagnosis of rickett-sial diseases ( 5). Little information exists regard- ing the prevalence of Rickettsia spp. in D. marginatus and D. reticulatus ticks in Germany. R. raoultii was re- cently detected in 23% of D. reticula- tus ticks ( 6). In 1977, Rehacek et al. identi ﬁ ed R. slovaca in 12% of Der- macentor spp. ticks from southern Baden-Wuerttemberg ( 7). Since then, this pathogen has not been detected in Germany. R. slovaca , a member of the spotted fever group, causes tick-borne lymphadenopathy, a relatively mild rickettsiosis ( 8). We report detection of R. slovaca in 5 of 666 Dermacen- tor spp. ticks from southern Germany. Moreover, we identi ﬁ ed a case of tick-borne lymphadenopathy from Rhineland-Palatinate. We collected 666 adult Derma- centor spp. ticks by blanket-dragging; 26 were collected along the Main Riv-er near Aschaffenburg (Bavaria), and 640 from the Rhine Valley near Lör-rach (Baden-Wuerttemberg). Ticks were homogenized, and the DNA was isolated by using the Maxwell 16 Instrument (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For detection of rickett-siae, a TaqMan real-time PCR with the LightCycler system (Roche Di-agnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was performed according to Wölfel et al. (9). A primer pair ampli ﬁ ed a 70-bp fragment of the citrate synthase ( gltA) gene. All positive samples were also tested with a PCR speci ﬁ c for the out- er membrane protein A ( rOmpA ) gene (10). This ampli ﬁ cation yielded an rOmpA fragment of 532 bp. Ampli ﬁ ed products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. For identi ﬁ cation of Rickettsia spp., ampli ﬁ cation products of the rOmpA PCR were sequenced by using ﬂ uorescence-labeled dideoxynucle- otide technology (Applied Biosys-tems, Darmstadt, Germany). Separa-tion of sequenced fragments and data collection were performed by using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). All obtained se-quences were analyzed and compared by using BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Rickettsia spp. was detected by both PCR methods in 31% of 666 Dermacentor spp. ticks examined. Se- quencing of part of the rOmpA gene showed that sequences of 5 samples (0.75%) from Aschaffenburg were R. slovaca , showing 100% similarity with a sequence deposited in GenBank (accession no. U43808). Only D. mar- ginatus ticks from Aschaffenburg were infected with R. slovaca , and 202 ticks from Lörrach were infected with R. raoultii . We also identi ﬁ ed a case of R. slo- vaca infection in southern Rhineland-Palatinate. The patient reported a tick bite; the tick was identi ﬁ ed as Der- macentor spp. Fever, lymphadenopa- thy of submandibular lymph nodes, and exanthema at the site of the tick bite developed 7 days later. Serologic examinations by using an immuno-ﬂ uorescent test (Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA, USA) showed antibody titers of 64 for immunoglobulin (Ig) M and 1,024 for IgG against rickett-siae of the spotted fever group. These results indicated an acute rickettsial infection. Because of strong cross-reactivity among all species in the spotted fever group, we cannot dif-ferentiate between antibodies against R. slovaca and other species in this group. However, another immuno ﬂ uo- rescent test for typhus group rick-ettsiae showed negative results, con-ﬁ rming that the patient was infected with spotted fever group rickettsiae. Results of PCRs speci ﬁ c for gltA and rOmpA of the patient’s tick were positive. We identi ﬁ ed R. slovaca by sequencing the rOmpA gene. The se- quence obtained showed 100% simi-larity with sequences in ticks from Aschaffenburg. Clinical symptoms, serologic results, and detection of R. slovaca in the tick from the patient strongly indicate that the patient had tick-borne lymphadenopathy caused by R. slovaca . The high prevalence of R. raoultii in Dermacentor spp. ticks is of con- cern because this species can also cause tick-borne lymphadenopathy, although R. raoultii is less pathogenic than R. slovaca (8). Tick-borne lymph- adenopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of tick-borne diseases. The extent of the distribution of R. slovaca and R. raoultii in Ger- many remains to be elucidated. This study was supported by the Landesstiftung Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, and the Grimminger Stiftung für Anthropozoonosenforschung, Germany.

BOOKS AND MEDIA Filoviruses: A Compendium of 40 Years of Epidemiological, Clinical, and Laboratory Studies Jens H. Kuhn, author, Charles H. Calisher, editor Springer-Verlag Wien, New York, NY, USA, 2008ISBN: 978-3-211-20670-6 Pages: 413 (includes CD-ROM); Price: US $279.00 E-book: www.springerlink.com/content/978-3-211-20670-6 In Filoviruses: A Compendium of 40 Years of Epidemiological, Clinical, and Laboratory Studies, Jens Kuhn presents a complete review of every paper published on the subject, as well as hundreds of unpublished reports. In addition, most of the world’s known experts on ﬁ loviruses contributed per- sonal data and anecdotes. A CD-ROM with a searchable list of all quoted ref-erences (≈4,500) is a useful addition to the book. The author details the history of all Marburg and Ebola outbreaks dur-ing the 40 years from the discovery of Marburg in 1967 to the latest Marburg outbreak in 2007 in Uganda, includ-ing dif ﬁ cult-to- ﬁ nd information. The clinical and pathologic presentations of Ebola and Marburg diseases in human and animal models contain a substantial number of black and white and color illustrations. With the range of the Ebola and Marburg viruses still unknown and the search for the animal reservoirs ongoing, antibody serosur-veys in humans and animals have been conducted in most countries in Africa and in the Philippines after the Ebola Reston outbreaks; Kuhn dedicates a long chapter to this subject. All animal species tested are presented in tables but, more interestingly, also indexed at the end of the book. This information is particularly valuable for ecologists and epidemiologists searching for the reservoir of ﬁ loviruses. Kuhn explains the structure and replication of the ﬁ loviruses, with the actual role of each gene of the virus from entry into the target cells to pro-duction of infectious virus. He lists di-agnosis techniques and experimental treatments of the Marburg and Ebola diseases, from the traditional healers to the molecular antisenses RNA ap-proaches. In the past 10 years, preex-posure and postexposures vaccinations have resulted in tremendous progress in schedules, routes of administration, and more importantly, understanding mechanisms of action. Lack or ef ﬁ - cacy of inactivated and live-attenuated constructs is reviewed of all testing in available animal models. This book is not, and is not sup- posed to be, a critical review of the literature but is rather a compilation of all known information on ﬁ lovi- ruses by subject matter experts that is presented for ﬁ lovirologists. Non- specialist virologists, scientists, epi-demiologists, clinicians, and students interested in the subject will also ﬁ nd the book useful, but they will have to digest and analyze the information and then weigh the values and relevance of this incredible compendium of data.

2080 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009ANOTHER DIMENSION During the summer of 2007, migratory joint pain de- veloped in my (E.B.B.) 86-year-old father, previously an ironworker, farmer, and World War II veteran. Because of occasional tick attachments, a Borrelia burgdorferi ELISA was performed; antibodies were not detected, and no treatment was instituted. In the fall, subtle memory loss developed, and he fell twice a few weeks apart. Dad jok-ingly blamed the falls and the memory loss on “old timer’s disease.” Subsequently, episodes of subtle confusion and more frequent memory loss generated family concern as to what the future might hold. On December 15, he broke his left femur during a fall while climbing 2 stairs to enter our home. Despite having successfully climbed those stairs thousands of times in the past, he would never climb those or any other stairs again. Retrospectively obvious, a pattern of insidious ill- ness characterized by joint pain, memory loss, and inco-ordination, not recognizable by my father or other family members, had begun before that summer. Medically stable historical problems included coronary artery disease, ath-erosclerosis, carotid artery occlusion, hypertension, and atrial ﬁ brillation. During the previous year, a normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia persisted. Despite normal serum iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin, and vitamin B12 values, anemia was attributed to intestinal blood loss. When examined in May 2007, before anesthe-sia for endoscopy, mood and affect were appropriate, recent and remote memory were intact, insight and judgment were good. A hiatal hernia, mild antral gastritis, and duodenitis were visualized.Initial Hospitalization When my father was hospitalized December 15, 2007, with a broken femur, a resting pill roll tremor and cogwheel rigidity were suggestive of Parkinson disease. Preoperative neurologic consultation identi ﬁ ed severe confusion, inatten- tion, and an inability to answer questions. Short-term mem-ory and problem-solving abilities were decreased. There was mild ptosis of the right eye, normal cranial nerves, mild asterixis, and hand weakness. Laboratory abnormali-ties included anemia, hypercreatinemia, an elevated aspar-tate aminotransferase level, and hyperglobulinemia. Due to the severity of the femoral fracture, the femoral head was excised and replaced with a bipolar femoral prosthesis. Postoperatively, poor mentation was considered a se- quela of general anesthesia and peri-operative analgesics. For more than a week, dementia persisted. He did not rec-ognize family members and had near constant hallucino-genic activities, including agitation, tying knots, sawing motions, and constantly pulling covers, bed clothes, and ﬂ uid lines. Severe hematuria developed after he pulled an inﬂ ated Foley catheter from his urethra. Concurrent gas- trointestinal bleeding of undetermined cause necessitated multiple blood transfusions. Other complications included difﬁ culty swallowing and paralytic ileus. Repeat abdomi- nal radiographs, in conjunction with stool softeners and laxatives, failed to alleviate gastrointestinal complications. Eventually, he refused food and became severely bloated. Endoscopy performed on December 26 identi ﬁ ed severe necrotizing esophagitis, multiple plaques, and a stricture attributed to Candida albicans and herpes zoster. C. albi- cans esophagitis is known to accompany HIV infection, leukemia, or an unidenti ﬁ ed source of immune suppres- sion ( 1,2). Shingles, caused by herpes zoster, occurred dur- ing the previous Thanksgiving and can be associated with A Groundhog, a Novel Bartonella Sequence, and My Father’s Death Edward B.

Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2081 immunosuppression, stress, or an aging immune system (3,4). Mentation and gastrointestinal abnormalities im- proved after starting treatment with ﬂ uconazole, acyclo- vir, and symptomatic medications for erosive esophagitis. However, confusion, lack of orientation, hyponatremia, hy-pokalemia, and hyperglycemia remained problematic until discharge to a physical therapy center on December 31. Second Hospitalization During the next week, strength and mental capacities improved rapidly and discharge to the home environment was scheduled for January 9. On that morning and while driving to Maryland to build entry ramps, I was informed by cell phone that my father fell out of a chair and became nonverbal and that a stroke was suspected. For me, the roller coaster illness ultimately leading to his death would take an unbelievable turn of events. Upon his transfer to the neurology service, encephalopathy, asterixis, Parkinso-nian-type tremor, hypoactive re ﬂ exes, pinpoint and mini- mally reactive pupils, and cogwheel rigidity were found. Verbal communication was absent, but he would grimace with pain whenever extremities were manipulated. An ur-gent computed tomography scan did not identify intracra-nial abnormalities. When I was a boy, my father used the expression “something is ﬁ shy in Denmark” to imply that something was astray. Based upon historical events, I suspected some-thing was being missed. Laboratory ﬁ ndings included anemia (hemocrit 34%), a normal leukogram (leukocytes 9,100 cells/ μL, 2% band neutrophils), mild hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperglycemia, increased serum alka-line phosphatase level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 79, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Thoracic radiographs identi ﬁ ed mild bilateral pleural effusion. Because an un- deﬁ ned infectious source of immunosuppression seemed plausible, and fever (maximum temperature 38.6°C) oc-curred 24 hours after neurologic decompensation an in-fectious etiology was pursued. Nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , blood, urine, and cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) cultures were negative. CSF results, including those for special stains, were unremarkable. Serologic re-sults for Treponema pallidum, Borrelia burgdorferi , Rick- ettsia rickettsii, Bartonella henselae, Bartonella quintana , and HIV were negative. Results of CSF herpes simplex PCR and a test for T. pallidum antibodies were negative. On January 11, results of magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography were interpreted as a left posterior stroke with no active bleeding. Initial treat-ment included intravenous acyclovir, ﬂ uconazole, vanco- mycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and dexamethasone.Translational Research and the Practice of Medicine Because I direct the Intracellular Pathogens Research Laboratory (IPRL) at the North Carolina State Univer-sity College of Veterinary Medicine, aseptically obtained blood and CSF samples were kindly provided for testing. Results of PCR ( 5,6) speci ﬁ c for Anaplasma, Ehrlichia , and Rickettsia species were negative. Bartonella 16S–23S intergenic spacer primers ( 7) repeatedly generated ampli- cons of different sizes from blood and CSF, respectively. Compared with GenBank sequences, the blood amplicon was most similar (434/465bp) to Candidatus Bartonella volans (strain FSq-1, EU294521) isolated from a south-ern ﬂ ying squirrel ( Glaucomys volans ) and Candidatus Bartonella durdenii (391/422bp) ampli ﬁ ed from Orcho- peas howardi (GenBank accession no. DQ 336386), a ﬂ ea found on eastern US gray squirrels ( Scinrus carolinensis ), and a Bartonella sp. (446/492bp, EF125214) identi ﬁ ed in ground squirrels ( Spermophilus danricus ) in the People’s Republic of China. The novel rodent Bartonella sequence obtained from my father’s blood had an 18-bp insert at positions 2047 or 334 in EU294521 and DQ336386, re-spectively. Previously, our laboratory had never worked with rodent Bartonella species and had never ampli ﬁ ed a 300-bp internal transcribed spacer region amplicon from >3,000 animal or human blood samples. After several un-successful cloning attempts, the CSF amplicon was most similar (393/394 bp) to B. henselae (NC-005956). Blood and CSF, cultured by using Bartonella α Proteobacte- ria growth medium (BAPGM) ( 8), did not result in the growth of a Bartonella species. Clinicians and Scientists Working Together After Bartonella PCR results became available, treat- ment with piperacillin and tazobactam were continued for 3 weeks, until discharge. Levetiracetam was added to the patient’s treatment because a generalized seizure occurred shortly after antimicrobial drugs were given. On January 18, severe dependent edema of the right elbow resulted in ﬂ uid leakage through intact skin. For 3 weeks, Dad re- mained semicomatose, disoriented, agitated, and enceph-alopathic. Hallucinations continued, accompanied by fre-quent involuntary motor movements. Diabetes mellitus and a large decubital ulcer on the right heel developed. During the fourth week, mentation improved, and he could rise and stand for brief periods. On January 28, he was discharged to a rehabilitation facility, with instructions to receive doxycycline and rifampin 2 ×/d for 13 days. Blood samples, obtained aseptically before discharge, were again submit-ted to the IPRL. After BAPGM pre-enrichment and subcul-ture, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i genotype II was isolated, and sequential serologic testing identi ﬁ ed a rising titer to ANOTHER DIMENSION

After a brief, emotionally traumatic stay at the rehabilitation facility, Dad returned home to be cared for by 4 sons, his wife of 60 years, and other family mem-bers. Each week a different son slept by his bed, which was relocated to the family living room. Home Again at Last During the next 3 weeks, there was substantial and pro- gressive improvement in physical capabilities and a return of normal mental capabilities, including exceptional short- and long-term memory. Appetite normalized, and despite severe atrophy, muscle strength increased so he could stand, walk with assistance, and, although a daily struggle, access the bathroom. A February 10 blood sample obtained while he was receiving oral antimicrobial drugs was Bartonella PCR negative, and no bacteria were isolated in BAPGM. During this precious 3 weeks, our father joked, laughed, and vividly recalled wartime friends and other experiences. On March 1, 2008, he opened Christmas presents with our family. I should have been there. Third and Final Hospitalization On March 4, ≈2 weeks after the course of oral antibi- otics was completed, agitation and disorientation returned, and mental status deteriorated. Within 24 hours, Dad was hospitalized, where ﬁ ne motor tremors of the right hand and wrist, asymmetric edema involving the right leg, and edema of the penis and scrotum were noted. He was afebrile and nonverbal and could not follow simple commands. He-matocrit was 30.2%, platelet count 557,000 cells/ μL, and leukocyte count 7,800 cells/ μL with a normal differential count. Serum biochemical abnormalities included hyper-glycemia (glucose 218 mg/dL), hyperglobulinemia (3.6 g/dL), and increased alkaline phosphatase activity (169 IU/L). Urinalysis abnormalities included proteinuria with occasional hyaline casts. Lorazepam was administered to control the agitation and restlessness. The warfarin dose was increased and heparinization initiated for a potential cerebrovascular accident. Due to the prior documentation of Bartonella infection, intravenous doxycycline, rifampin, and gen-tamicin were administered, and total parenteral nutrition was instituted. Again, shortly after initiation of antimi-crobial drugs, a seizure occurred. Bartonella spp. were not ampli ﬁ ed or isolated from a 1-mL blood sample ob- tained 4 days after initiation of treatment with antimicro-bial drugs. During the next 3 weeks, while intravenous antimicrobial drugs were administered, our father again remained encephalopathic, with frequent hallucinations, severe agitation, and near-constant mental confusion. On March 14, intravenous methylprednisolone for potential immune-mediated vasculitis elicited no improvement in mental status. Similar to the previous treatment course, improvement in mental status, coherent communication, and renewed ability to recognize family members oc-curred during the fourth hospitalization week. A Battle Lost On April 4, Dad was discharged to our home and oral antimicrobial drugs (doxycycline and rifampin) were dis-pensed. Despite all efforts by medical professionals, mem-bers of our family, and our tough 86-year-old father, pro-tracted illness and prolonged hospitalizations had resulted in mental and physical debilitation, severe muscle wasting, and profound weakness. More important, he had lost his desire to live. After discharge, there was minimal neuro-logic improvement. Before the availability of April 4 IPRL test results, he began to refuse all medications. The identi-cal rodent Bartonella DNA sequence was again ampli ﬁ ed from his blood, but no bacteria were isolated. Four weeks later my father died, on Friday, May 2, at 5 PM, around quitting time for an old iron worker. My mother and youngest brother were at his side. After his Table.

Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2083 death, blood culture results from another sample obtained by the hospice nurse on April 28, 2008, became available. B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i genotype II was ampli ﬁ ed and sequenced from the enrichment BAPGM blood culture. As direct extraction of DNA from blood was negative, growth of viable bacteria in liquid culture was implicated ( 8,9). Groundhogs, Fleas, and the Genus Bartonella Following our father’s death, I recalled a small, 0.5-cm, raised, ﬁ rm lesion within his right eyebrow that developed during the summer of 2007 and would spontaneously hurt or burn, causing him to rub or squeeze the lesion. The mass disappeared after he began taking antimicrobial drugs in 2008. Retrospectively, I suspected a rodent ﬂ ea bite above the eye had transmitted a novel Bartonella species, which we sequenced from his blood after each hospitalization. All known Bartonella spp. have preferential animal reser- voir hosts, and each uses arthropods or animal bites and scratches as the primary modes of transmission ( 10–12). Dad would occasionally capture mice, rats, skunks, and groundhogs in the barns. Groundhogs were transported in the car trunk to a distant location for release, potentially leaving behind ﬂ eas. Therefore, 3 Candidatus Bartonella spp. isolates were provided by Dr. William Nicholson, a colleague at the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion in Atlanta. After sequencing, the 16S–23S intergenic spacer region of a ground squirrel ( Candidatus Bartonella durdenii), a ﬂ ying squirrel ( Candidatus Bartonella volans), and a groundhog ( Candidatus Bartonella monaxi) isolate, the most similar GenBank sequence was Candidatus Bar- tonella volans. There was no perfect match with these 3 iso-lates. However, sequences from Dad’s blood clustered with a squirrel Bartonella subgroup. This observation supports the presence of a novel Bartonella species on the eastern shore of Maryland, an as yet unde ﬁ ned animal reservoir, and an unknown arthropod vector. Regardless of the mode(s) of transmission, repeated molecular documentation of a novel rodent Bartonella sp. and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i supports the unexpected failure of 2 intensive courses of intravenous and oral anti-microbial drugs to eliminate these fastidious, intravascular bacteria. During the ﬁ rst two hospitalization periods, there was similar and progressive improvement in neurologic signs and mental capabilities that began during the fourth week of antimicrobial drug administration. Pre-enrichment BAPGM growth of B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i from blood obtained 4 days before death supports persistence of viable organisms. Recently, antimicrobial drug resistance genes have been characterized in B. bacilliformis , B. henselae , and B. quintana by in vitro serial passage ( 13–15). Retro- spectively, the relapse in encephalopathic signs might have been avoided if antimicrobial drugs were continued for a larger interval after discharge from hospital 2, and blood cultures were optimally obtained and sequentially tested to conﬁ rm therapeutic elimination. Elimination of Bartonella spp. by antimicrobial drugs in immunocompetent patients may be more dif ﬁ cult to achieve than is currently appreciated ( 16). Although co- infection with B. henselae and B. vinsonii subsp. berk- hofﬁ i has been previously reported, DNA of 3 Bartonella spp. was detected in our father. Based on repeatable PCR testing, a small quantity of B. henselae DNA was in the January CSF sample. Because PCR amplicon contamina-tion was never detected in any negative control, laboratory error is considered unlikely. Although the BAPGM enrich-ment approach has improved molecular detection and iso-lation of some Bartonella spp. from human patient samples (9,16–18), a rodent Bartonella sp. isolate was not obtained. Unfortunately, 8 weeks can be required from inoculation of BAPGM until a subculture agar plate isolate is character-ized by DNA sequencing. Therefore, IPRL test results were often not available to Dad’s physicians in a timely manner. Age, Bartonella spp., and Immune Suppression? Suspicion of an undetermined source of immune sup- pression and recent tick exposures were primary factors motivating testing in the IPRL. Previously, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i was shown to induce immunosuppression in experimentally infected dogs ( 19,20). In retrospect, oc- cult infection with Bartonella spp. may have contributed to shingles at Thanksgiving and necrotizing C. albicans esophagitis after hospitalization for the fractured femur. Recently, B. quintana lipopolysaccharide was found to have antiin ﬂ ammatory properties ( 21). Immune suppressive fac- tors may facilitate persistent intravascular Bartonella in- fection without inducing obvious infection indicators, such as fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and CSF pleocytosis. Fever was documented once and mild neutrophilia for 3 of 48 blood counts. Thrombocytosis, previously associated with B. henselae (22), was documented 14 times. Ecologic Complexity of Bartonella spp. Because of my father’s long-standing atherosclerosis and because BAPGM will grow a spectrum of seemingly difﬁ cult to isolate bacteria ( 8,23), pre-enrichment blood cultures and Bartonella internal transcribed spacer region PCR had been performed in September 2005 and August 2006 (Table). Bartonella spp. were not ampli ﬁ ed or iso- lated, which suggests infection occurred after the summer of 2006. Transmission of B. henselae, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i , and B. alsatica can occur as a result of a scratch from a cat, a dog, or a wild rabbit, respectively ( 17,24–26). Cats are the primary reservoir for B. henselae , whereas dogs and coyotes are the only reported reservoir hosts for B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i genotype II in North America (27). Recently, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i genotype II was ANOTHER DIMENSION

2084 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009ANOTHER DIMENSION isolated by BAPGM blood culture from a cat with recur- rent osteomyelitis (E.B. Breitschwerdt, unpub. data), which suggests that a bacteremic cat might facilitate transmission of this subspecies. My parents had an old ( ≈21 years of age) exclusively outdoor barn cat that would occasional-ly scratch. The cat could not be tested because it died in 2007. B. henselae and B. clarridgeae have been transmit- ted experimentally by transfusion to cats ( 24). Because B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i seroconversion occurred during hospitalization, transfusion-associated transmission is also possible. The exact timing and mode of transmission of B. henselae, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i, and the rodent Bar- tonella sp. to our father cannot be established. However, his illness serves to illustrate the medical and ecologic com-plexity of this genus. Occult Infection and Chronic Illness Reconstructing the history of a chronic illness is al- ways dif ﬁ cult and remains an unexacting science due to known, unknown, and undetermined factors that in ﬂ uence disease expression over time. Experimental studies that used rodent models have emphasized the ability of Bar- tonella spp. to invade erythrocytes and vascular endothe- lial cells ( 28). In vitro studies indicate that B. henselae can infect macrophages, microgial cells, dendritic cells, and CD34+ progenitor cells ( 29). B. henselae and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i have been ampli ﬁ ed from dog lymph node aspiration samples ( 30). Thus in a given patient, Bartonella organisms likely infect a substantial number of cellular targets. B. henselae infection induces chronic arthritis in a subset of cat scratch disease (CSD) patients, and atypical CSD manifestations are more likely to develop in elderly patients ( 31,32). In the context of arthritis, B. henselae and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i were repeatedly isolated from joint ﬂ uid from a dog in which repeated antimicrobial drug therapy was not successful ( 33). Although a spectrum of acute and generally self-limiting neurologic manifestations have been historically described in CSD patients, B. hense- lae and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i were only recently iso- lated from patients with chronic neurologic and neurocog- nitive abnormalities ( 16). We propose that the initial arthritic signs, short-term memory loss, and incoordination were premonitory signs of Bartonella spp. infection, and that persistent infection contributed to localized edema, nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytosis, hyperglobulinemia, and a protracted de-bilitating illness accompanied by hallucinations, agitation, seizures, and death. Agitation, disorientation, and combat-ive behavior have been reported in association with CSD and physicians have implicated Bartonella spp. as con- tributors to agitation and treatment-resistant depression (34,35). Memory loss and a spectrum of neurocognitive complaints have also been reported in immunocompetent persons infected with B. vinsonii subsp. berkhof ﬁ i and B. henselae (9,16,17). My Father and “One Medicine” In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the concept of “One Medicine” ( 36). I hope that lessons from my father’s death can reinforce the importance of “One Medicine.” However, as in the past, rhetoric may not result in needed increases in resource allocation to enhance edu-cational, research, service, and public health capabilities of the veterinary profession ( 37). In the context of vector- borne infectious diseases, zoonotic diseases, food safety, zoologic medicine, and environmental medicine and eco-system health, to name a few areas, veterinarians continue to make major contributions that ensure and enhance the daily health of animals and humans. Because of a research focus in comparative infectious diseases and knowledge of the biologic, immunologic, and pathophysiologic behavior of Bartonella spp. in a spectrum of animal species, a vet- erinary research laboratory was able to assist with the man-agement of my father’s illness. As is often true of research at the bedside and the lab- oratory bench, new lessons and challenges arose from the collective efforts of doctors, nurses, veterinarians, research scientists, and others attempting to heal my father. I and my family remain sincerely grateful to the many doctors, nurses, and other caregivers who contributed to the management of my father’s surgical and medical problems. Because of the severe encephalopathic and combative nature of his behav-ior, this was frequently not an easy or pleasant task. Dur-ing his illness, I was struck by several items: 1) most nurses are absolutely amazing, caring, and dedicated profession-als; 2) in human medicine, unlike veterinary medicine, no physician claimed or accepted the responsibility to be my father’s doctor; and 3) for many reasons, I found the human healthcare system to be frayed, if not broken. Whether blame lies with the insurance companies, our litigious society, the proﬁ t-based motivations of hospital administration, the in- creased complexity of medical technology, or the medical education of physicians, it really does not matter. As my fa-ther would say, “It is no way to do business.” I have taught internal medicine at a College of Veterinary Medicine for 32 years. During that time, every sick animal on our medical service had at least 2 doctors (1 being a student), who were directly responsible for the animal’s care, for frequent com-munications with the owner, and for communications with the referring veterinarian. In our increasingly complex hos-pital environments, every patient needs a personal advocate or designated doctor to represent his or her interests. Epilogue Some years ago in a conversation with my mother I suggested that the term natural death may well represent an

Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009 2085 oversimpli ﬁ cation of the processes that end a person’s life. My father and our family were substantially affected dur-ing his illness. Each day, from initial hospitalization until his death, there was at least 1 family member at his side. In the eyes of family and friends, my father was a great man in so many respects. He was a loving husband, a car-ing father, diligent worker, and a friend and supporter to many persons. Potentially, his illness illustrates a complex interaction between intravascular Bartonella infection and complex disease expression, provides documentation for an as yet uncharacterized zoonotic rodent Bartonella sp., and offers disconcerting evidence supporting antimicrobial drug ineffectiveness and clinical evidence supporting the concept that persistent infection with >1 Bartonella spp. may lead to immunosuppression and opportunistic infec-tions with organisms such as herpes zoster and C. albicans . As in his life, Dad would want this story to bene ﬁ t others after his death. We hope that it does.

ABOUT THE COVER “I wed art. It is my husband ―my world ―my life- dream―the air I breathe,” said Rosa Bonheur, ex- plaining her life choices. “Art is absorbent ―a tyrant. It de- mands heart, brain, soul, body, the entireness of its votary.” A native of Bordeaux, France, Bonheur was betrothed to art early in life, born into a family of artists. They moved to Paris when she was still a young child. Precocious and headstrong, she had to be coaxed to learn how to read by her mother, who had her select and draw an animal for each letter of the alphabet. Bonheur later attributed her love of drawing animals to this early practice. During her early days in Paris when the family lived in an apartment, she kept a small menagerie of ducks, rabbits, squirrels, and a sheep that had to be carried up and down the stairs regularly. Expelled from traditional schools for rebelliousness by age 12 and refusing to apprentice with a seamstress, another conventional option, she was turned over to her father Raimond Bonheur, a painter, sculptor, and educator, for instruction. She showed herself a dili-gent and conscientious art student and soon began copying masterpieces at the Louvre. She assisted him with painting commissions and excelled as sculptor. She started visiting Paris abattoirs and the École nationale vétérinaire d’Alfort to learn animal anatomy by dissecting carcasses. “Oh! You’ve got to be devoted to art to live in pools of blood, surrounded by butchers.” She also attended horse fairs and farmers’ markets to observe animals’ emotions and behavior. During these out-ings, “I was forced to recognize that the clothing of my sex was a constant bother. That is why I decided to solicit the authorization to wear men’s clothing from the prefect of police. But the suit I wear is my work attire and noth-ing else.” Despite her protestations, Bonheur’s independent thinking, original approach to societal restrictions, and bo-hemian lifestyle created an aura of notoriety about her that at times eclipsed her artistic accomplishments. She met and became friends with Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and his son, Isidore, renowned anatomists and zoologists. Her sympathetic portrayal of animals was in-ﬂ uenced by their studies in natural history, particularly the father’s unity of composition principle. He believed that all organisms shared the same underlying design and that diversity in external form was simple variation.

ABOUT THE COVER one of the reptiles … could develop in every part of the body the conditions of the ornithological type.” Bonheur’s style was part of the realist movement of the mid-1800s, led by Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet. In this style, which relied on direct observation and meticulous draftsmanship, naturalism was aligned with social causes and the labor movement. Despite prevailing trends, which favored rural life, the plight of peasants, and the ills of growing industrialization, she chose animals as her subjects. Even in rural scenes, her focus was on them. Her af ﬁ nity to animals and her devotion to showing them in their natural environment established her as the foremost animalière of her century, one of the best of all time. Although she was aware of the impressionists, Bon- heur did not adopt their style. For inspiration she turned in-stead to the Parthenon friezes and the romantic paintings of horses by Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix. She was also in ﬂ uenced by her friend, the acclaimed English animal painter Edward Landseer. Her work attracted early attention. She began exhibit- ing in the Salon at age 19 and continued to exhibit there successfully over many years. She stopped showing sculp-ture when she became aware of her brother Isidore’s talent in that art. She “did not want to hinder [his] artistic career.” Her painting Cows and Bulls of the Cantal received a gold medal at the Salon. After this success she received a com-mission from the government to create a painting of ani-mals at work in the ﬁ elds. The work, Plowing in Nivernais, was very well received. When her father died, she succeeded him as director of the art school for girls where he had worked. At that time she also established a studio with friend and fellow artist Nathalie Micas and began to work on massive paintings of horses. One of these, The Horse Fair, became a sensa-tion and attracted the attention of Britain’s Queen Victoria. Bonheur’s fame was far-reaching. She received the Cross of San Carlos of Mexico; membership in the Académie des Beaux-Arts of Antwerp, Belgium; the Commander’s Cross of the Royal Order of Isabella from Spain’s Alphonso XII; and the French Legion of Honor. She handled fame grace-fully and wore the medals. As her commercial success increased, she was able to move to a chateau outside Paris near the forest of Fon-tainebleau. On these spacious grounds, she created a small zoo, with ponies, deer, monkeys, cattle, and other ani-mals that populated her future work. “One of her pets was a young lion whom she allowed to run about and often romped with.” Bonheur’s fascination with the New World and the American West began with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West ex-travaganza, a combination of circus and historical reenact-ment, during its European tour through France. She trav-eled to the United States and painted American themes and a famous portrait of Buffalo Bill Cody, who became her friend. Her interest in the United States led to her long con-nection with Anna Klumpke, an American artist, who after Bonheur’s death, found hundreds of paintings and drawings unseen by anyone in her friend’s studio and pulled together the artist’s (auto)biography. Plowing in Nivernais, on this month’s cover, is a copy by Bonheur of the original government commission, made a year later and likely inspired by The Devil’s Pool, a novel by George Sand (1804–1876). This story, about the dis-placement of peasants by industrialization, contained the lines, “But what caught my attention was a truly beautiful sight, a noble subject for a painter. At the far end of the ﬂ at plow land, a handsome young man was driving a magni ﬁ - cent team [of] oxen.” Bonheur lived in Nivernais, in central France, for weeks, observing the animals and the land, the people at work, the agricultural tools. Her depiction was so accurate that the region was immediately identi ﬁ ed when the painting was unveiled. “Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what is that you express in your eyes?” wondered Walt Whitman in his poem Song of Myself, “It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.” In Bonheur’s own “poem,” the massive beasts crisscross the good earth, plowing uphill. Slow and solid, they dominate a landscape vast as the sky, tails whisking, mucus glistening. The peas-ants are in the sidelines. Small and unimposing, they follow or step next to them, light-footed, like dancers. The man toward the front holds a thin stick above his head, exert-ing dominance, choreographing the animals’ movements. He is their colleague, a member of the herd, who grooms and feeds them and lives with them. The animal in the lead squints ahead, one that follows looks directly at us. Indus-trialization has not yet arrived in this agrarian corner. Nineteenth-century concerns about the spread of ur- banization have only grown in our times. The percentage of residents in urban areas is projected to increase from 50% in 2008 to 70% in 2025. But along with displacement of agriculture, other fears cloud the horizon. Crowded urban areas have become uniquely vulnerable to public health crises, not least of them pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Recent outbreaks in Mexico City and New York demonstrate that surveillance efforts and management of public health com-munication and response demand exceptional alertness and coordination. And the animals? “[T]hey are so placid and self contan’d, / I stand and look at them long and long,” wrote Whitman when he offered to “turn and live with” them. For the poet, they held as much fascination as for Bonheur, who ﬁ rst brought them into her apartment and later established them in her own zoo at Fontainebleau, shunning portraiture and trendy interiors to paint them exclusively. He was at-tracted to their non-humanness, “They do not sweat and 2088 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009

ABOUT THE COVER whine about their condition, / They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins.” Furthermore, “Not one is dis-satisﬁ ed, not one is demented with the mania of owning things, / Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago, / Not one is respectable or unhappy over the earth.” Bonheur understood animals. Her unconventional spir- it was drawn to their wildness. “I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable, / I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.” But, like the poet, she did not know all we share with them. Her furry friends in the apartment or the chateau ―rodents, rabbits, goats, deer, cattle, lions- and some that she did not collect, appear in the pages of this issue. For they share with us not just living space but countless infections. How could the artist have known the litany of zoonoses that continue to complicate our relationship with animals: highly pathogenic in ﬂ uenza A virus (H5N1) in backyard chickens; human trichinellosis associated with ingestion of soft-shelled turtles; new adenovirus in bats; polycystic echinococcosis in jaguar hunters; Bartonella rochalimae in raccoons, coyotes, and red foxes; Ehrlichia chaffeensis in Sika Deer; Mycobacterium bovis and M. tuberculosis from goats.

MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION . Include a cover letter indicating the proposed category of the article (e.g., Research, Dispatch) and verifying that the ﬁ nal manuscript has been seen and approved by all authors. Complete provided Authors Checklist. To submit a manuscript, access Manuscript Central from the Emerging Infectious Diseases web page (www.cdc.gov/eid). Types of Articles Perspectives. Articles should be under 3,500 words and should include references, not to exceed 40. Use of subheadings in the main body of the text is recommended. Photographs and illustrations are encouraged. Pro-vide a short abstract (150 words), a one-sentence summary of the conclu-sions, and a brief biographical sketch. Articles in this section should provide insightful analysis and commentary about new and reemerging infectious diseases and related issues. Perspectives may also address factors known to inﬂ uence the emergence of diseases, including microbial adaptation and change, human demographics and behavior, technology and industry, eco-nomic development and land use, international travel and commerce, and the breakdown of public health measures. If detailed methods are included, a separate section on experimental procedures should immediately follow the body of the text. Synopses. Articles should be under 3,500 words and should include ref- erences, not to exceed 40. Use of subheadings in the main body of the text is recommended. Photographs and illustrations are encouraged. Provide a short abstract (150 words), a one-sentence summary of the conclusions, and a brief biographical sketch. This section comprises concise reviews of infectious diseases or closely related topics. Preference is given to reviews of new and emerging diseases; however, timely updates of other diseases or topics are also welcome. If detailed methods are included, a separate section on experimental procedures should immediately follow the body of the text. Research Studies. Articles should be under 3,500 words and should in- clude references, not to exceed 40. Use of subheadings in the main body of the text is recommended. Photographs and illustrations are encouraged.
