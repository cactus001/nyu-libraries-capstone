BUILDING ENERGY CODES PROGRAM I MPACTS OF STANDARD 90.1-2007 FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AT STATE LEVEL III Executive Summary The Building Energy Codes Program (BECP) recently conducted a nationwide commercial energy code analysis for the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE). The analysis compares ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA1 Standard 1-2007 with the commercial code in each state as of June 2009. The results are provided in this report in chapters specific to each state. Standard 90.1-2007 was chosen for this analysis because it is the baseline energy standard established in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the subject of DOE’s forthcoming determination of energy savings for Standard 90.1. An overview of Standard 90.1-2007, as well as a brie f comparison to previous versions, is provided as introductory information. States with unique energy codes were not included in the analysis as the c odes in these states would be difficult to appropriately compare to Standard 90.1 and most of these states have energy offices that routinely assess their codes against the national codes. In states with codes prior to a nd including the 2000 IECC or Standard 1-1999, those states with no statewide en ergy code, and home rule states which did not specifically request that another code be used, Sta ndard 90.1-1999 was used as the baseli ne for comparison. Standard 90.1-1999 was chosen as the default baseline because BECP believes it fairly represents current construction practice in states with older codes or no codes. Three DOE Benchmark buildings were used for the simula tion used in this analysis: a medium office building (53,600 ft 2), a mid-rise apartment building (33,700 ft2), and a non-refrigerated warehouse (49,500 ft2)— representing the Standard 90.1 nonresid ential, residential, and semiheat ed requirements, respectively. The buildings are described in further deta il in the report, and in Appendix A. Locations for the analysis were selected based on obtaini ng a sample representative of each climate zone in the state, where TMY2 weather f ile locations existed, making sure to include the state capital. In the absence of a TMY2 weather file for a particular climate zone in a st ate, a representative location in an adjacent state was used for the purposes of the simulation. These locations, and the full results of each state specific analysis completed by BECP, are provided in the following report.2 1 American National Standards Institute/American Society of H eating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers/Illuminating Engineering Society of North America 2 DISCLAIMER: The results contained in these reports are complete and accurate to th e best of BECP’s knowledge, based on information available at the time it was written.

BUILDING ENERGY CODES PROGRAM I MPACTS OF STANDARD 90.1-2007 FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AT STATE LEVEL 1 1.0 Introduction This report describes the results of a nationwide commercial energy code analysis undertaken by the Building Energy Codes Program (BECP) for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The task involved comparing each state’s current commercial energy code3 to ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA4 Standard 90.1-2007 (Standard 90.1-2007). State-specific results are pr ovided in separate chapters. The commercial comparison is made to Standard 90.1-2007 because that is the baseline commercial energy standard established in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Standard 90.1-2007 will also soon be the subject of DOE’s latest determ ination of energy savings for Standard 90.1. 0 Overview of Standard 90.1-2007 Standard 90.1-2007 sets requirements for the cost-effectiv e use of energy in commercial buildings. Certain buildings that have very lo w energy use, such as buildings with no h eating or cooling, are exempt. Standard 1-2007 applies to new buildings and to alterations and additi ons to existing buildings. Table 1 shows the organization of Standard 90.1-2007. Most of the actual require ments are contained in Sections 5-10. Table 1.

Standard 90.1 was placed under continuous maintenance in 1999 which a llowed the Standard to be updated with publication of approved addenda. Beginning with Standard 90.1-2001, the Standard moved to a three-year publication cycle. Substantial revisions to the Standard have occurred since 1989. One major change was a complete revision of the climate zones in 2004. These revised climates zones are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Climate Zones

BUILDING ENERGY CODES PROGRAM I MPACTS OF STANDARD 90.1-2007 FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AT STATE LEVEL 3 Some of the significant requireme nts in Standard 90.1-2007 include:  Stringent building in sulation requirements  Simplified fenestration requirements excl uding orientation an d window wall ratio  Demand control ventilation requirements for spaces w ith an occupant density greater than 40 people per 1000 ft2  Separate simple and complex mechanical requirements. 0 Energy Analysis Assumptions An energy analysis was conducted co mparing each state’s base code to Standard 90.1-2007. The EnergyPlus software was used to determine the energy impacts. EnergyPlus was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy5 (DOE). 1 State Base Codes States with unique energy codes (i .e., those that do not adopt/amend th e International Energy Conservation Code® [IECC] or Standard 90.1) were not included in the analysis. Th is decision was made by DOE for two reasons: 1) these states generally have codes that have little resemb lance to Standard 90.1, making a thorough comparison beyond the scope of this effort, and 2) most of these states have highly capable energy offices that routinely assess their codes against the national codes. Ho wever, states that were not included in the original analysis may request to be considered for a similar analysis by contacting BECP at techsupport@becp.pnl.gov . In some cases, decisions about base codes needed to be made. For example, all versions of the IECC include two compliance options for commercial buildings: the commercial requirements in the IECC and Standard 1. Since there can only be one base code in the analysis, if a state specifically adopts the IECC as its commercial code, the commercial requirements from the app licable IECC were used in the analysis. There are several states with older commercial codes6. For states with codes prior to and including the 2000 IECC or Standard 90.1-1999, Standard 90.1-1999 was used as the base code. Standard 90.1-1999 was chosen as the baseline construc tion for states with older codes because it has been around long enough (about 10 years) to al low many of the concepts and requirements embodied in it to become common practice in the constr uction industry. Standard 90.1-1999 also represents a major change in ASHRAE standards, coming ten years after th e previous version of Standard 90.1. Standard 90.1-1999 is old enough that states considering adoption of Standard 90.1-2007 will still see significant savings, but not so old that states will be misled by the savings shown in this report. K eeping with the concept of Standard 90.1-1999 as “common practice” in the construction industry, Standard 90.1-1999 was also used as the base code for states with no state-wide commercial energy c ode. Some home rule states7 requested a specific code be used in the analysis; for all other home rule states Standard 90.1-1999 was used as the base code. 5 EnergyPlus is available and discussed in more detail at http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/ 6 Examples include codes based on 90A90B, 90.1-1989, and the 1992 Model Energy Code. 7 In home rule states, codes are adopted and enforced on a local level.

BUILDING ENERGY CODES PROGRAM I MPACTS OF STANDARD 90.1-2007 FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AT STATE LEVEL 4 4.2 Benchmark Buildings Three DOE Benchmark buildings8 were used for the simulation: a medium office building, a mid-rise apartment building, and a non-refrigerated warehouse (semih eated). These three building types represent the Standard 90.1 nonresidential, residentia l, and semiheated requirements, resp ectively. For states that have adopted a newer version of Standard 90.1 (1999 or late r), the three types of e nvelope requirements were compared directly. For states that have adopted a ve rsion of the IECC that contains only a single set of commercial envelope requirements (any version prior to the 2009 IECC), the medium office and mid-rise apartment buildings were modeled using the single set of IECC requirements. The warehouse building was modeled using the semiheated envelope requirements from the reference standard version of Standard 90.1 incorporated in the version of th e IECC under consideration. DOE assume s that any designer of a warehouse that would truly be considered semi heated within Standard 90.1 would be motivated to use the Standard 90.1 semiheated envelope requirements as allowed by the IECC. Use of the IECC requirements for semiheated values in a comparison with Sta ndard 90.1-2007 would lead to the awkward conclusion that the IECC is more stringent. This is true in th e sense that use of more insulation in semiheated buildings will save some energy. However, because Standard 90.1-2007 is the designated comparison and it has separate semiheated envelope requirements, DOE chose to compare those semiheated requirements in the ASHRAE reference standard to the IECC. The medium office has a gross area of 53,600 ft 2, three floors, and a window-to- wall ratio (WWR) of 33%. The HVAC systems are assumed to be a gas furnace and a pack aged DX unit. The walls are modeled as steel frame walls, and the roof as insulation entirely above deck. The mid-rise apartment building has a gross area of 33,700 ft 2, four floors, and a WWR of 15%. The assumed heating system is a gas furnace, with one split DX system assumed to provide cooling for each apartment. The walls are modeled as steel frame walls, and th e roof as insulation entirely above deck. The semiheated warehouse has a gross area of 49,500 ft2, one floor, and no windows in the storage area. Limited heating is provided by unit heaters and no coo ling is provided. The walls and roof are modeled as metal building walls and roof. The DOE Benchmark buildings are also further described in Appendix A. Equipment efficiencies are assumed to be the current Federal requirements for all codes. While older codes may have older (lower) equipment efficiencies listed in them, equipment that meets the requirements of these old codes may no longer be manufactured or imported into the United States. Thus, this equipment is typically not available. There are some pieces of HVAC equipm ent that are not covered by the Federal requirements (notably, chillers), bu t the HVAC equipment modeled in the three benchmark buildings used in the analysis is covered by the Federal requirements. The HVAC system for the medium office building is simu lated with an economizer when required by the code. By default, the economizer requirements are base d on Table 6.5.1 in Standard 90.1-2004. A design day simulation was done in all climate z ones to determine the cooling capacity and the economizer requirement. The typical cooling capacity in the medium office build ing exceeds 135,000 Btu/h in all climate zones. Table 3 shows the economizer requirement for representative locations in the vari ous climate zones. The building 8 The Benchmark buildings are available at and discussed in more detail at http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/benchmark_models.html .

BUILDING ENERGY CODES PROGRAM I MPACTS OF STANDARD 90.1-2007 FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AT STATE LEVEL 5 simulation assumes that the economizer high limit s hutoff will be controlled by differential dry bulb temperature, a control opti on allowed by the Standard. Under this control scenario, when the outdoor air temperature is below both the return air temperature and the high ambient shutoff temperature, the economizer is enabled. Table 3.

As an example, Table 4 shows the allowable interior lighting power densities for the three buildings used in this analysis. Similar differences in requirements for other building types can also be listed.

Comparison of Lighting Power Density Requirements Standard/Code Version Allowable Interior Lighting Power Density (whole building) – watts per square foot Office Mid-Rise Apartment Warehouse Standard 90.1.1989, 1998 IECC, 2000 IECC 1.5 to 1.9 Apartment lighting not covered, Multifamily not listed 0.4 to 0.8 Standard 90.1-1999, Standard 90.1-2001 1.3 Apartment lighting not covered, Multifamily 1.0 1.2 Standard 90.1-2004, Standard 90.1-2007, 2003 IECC, 2006 IECC, 2009 IECC 1.0 Apartment lighting not covered, Multifamily 0.7 0.8 The issue with the 2003 IECC is that it uses Standa rd 90.1-2001 as its reference standard. The 2003 IECC contains the low lighting power densitie s exemplified by the 1.0 watt per square foot value in the actual text of Chapter 8. But the 2003 IECC also allows the use of Standard 90.1-2001 under the provisions of Chapter 7. And Standard 90.1-2001 has the mid-range interior ligh ting power densities exemp lified by the 1.3 watts per square foot value. No other versi on of the IECC has as signif icant a discontinuity between the requirements of the IECC and the requirements of th e ASHRAE reference standard. For this analysis, the requirements of the 2003 IECC were used. While lighting designers may very well have discovered this discontinuity, the us e of the 2003 requirements provide a c onservative estimate of the savings associated with adoption of Standard 90.1-2007. Use of Standard 90.1-2001 lighting densities as the baseline would simply increase the savings. The simulation models for nonresidentia l and semiheated buildings use the lighting power density requirements for office and warehouse, depending on the activity type of the thermal zone. In the case of the residential building model, the lighting power dens ity is not regulated in older codes and is assumed to be 0.36 W/sf in apartment units based on the Building America benc hmark model. The office area and corridor lighting requirements in the residential building model are based on Standard 90.1-2004 requirements. 4 Selected Locations The approach used to select representative locations for the analysis first focu sed on the goal of having one location to represent each climate zone within a state, with one of the loca tions being the state capital. TMY2 weather file locations were used. When a climate zone in a state was not represented by a TMY2 weather file location in that state, a representative location in an adjacent state was sel ected to represent the climate zone for purposes of the simulation. However, a representative city within the actual state is referenced in the report tables. A listing of the selected locations is shown below.

BUILDING ENERGY CODES PROGRAM I MPACTS OF STANDARD 90.1-2007 FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS IN OKLAHOMA Oklahoma Summary Oklahoma has no statewide commercial code, therefore fo r this state comparison, DOE has selected Standard 1-1999 as the baseline standard for the analysis. Standard 90.1-2007 w ould substantially improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings in Oklahoma. The analysis of the imp act of Standard 90.1-2007 resulted in energy and cost savings. Main Differences Between the Current State Code and Standard 90.1-2007 Standard 90.1-1999 precedes Standard 90.1-2004 and is th erefore older (and less stringent) than DOE’s currently mandated commercial building energy standard, Standard 90.1-2004. This selection was made in the belief that Standard 90.1-1999 is an appropriate represen tation of commercial current practice, as it was developed more than ten years ago. DOE’s analysis of Standard 90.1-1999 is include d in DOE’s determination of energy savings for Standard 90.1-2004, which co mpared Standard 90.1-2004 to Standard 90.1-2001 and Standard 90.1-1999. The complete results of this analysis may be found at http://www.energycodes.gov/impl ement/determinations_90.1-2004.stm . In comparing Standard 90.1-1999 to Standard 90.1-2007, Standard 90.1-2007:  Has fewer climate “zones” or “bins” (26 bins versus 8 climate zones).  Has more stringent building envelope requirements (due in large part to having fewer climate zones).  Has more strict requirements for vestibules in cold climates.  Differentiates windows by fixed versus operable ra ther than by frame material and usage.  Includes a requirement for demand controlled ventilation in high occupancy spaces.  Removes a deadband exception for data processing centers that eliminates the possibility of simultaneous heating and cooling.  Increases stringency in fan power limitations.  Increases boiler efficiency requirements.  Applies part-load fan power require ments to more smaller systems.  Revises the additional lighting power allowance for re tail displays to lower the allowance for some categories of merchandise.  Has more detailed outdoor lighting power requirements. A comparison of the thermal envelope requirements is provided in Table 1. 1

The EnergyPlus software was used to determine the energy impacts. Summary savings results are shown below by building type. Results are shown for the electricity and natura l gas energy use intensity (i n kWh/sf-year and kBtu/sf- year, respectively) for both the base code and Standard 90.1-2007. Result s are also shown for the percent reduction of overall site energy usage and energy cost from the base case to Standard 90.1-2007. The energy cost savings are estimated using national average energy costs of $0.0939 per kWh for electricity and $1.2201 per therm for natural gas. Presentation of the individual results for electricity and natural gas usage allows interested parties to calculate source energy or energy cost savings based on state (rather than national average) fuel prices. Total annual energy usage for the three building prototypes may be calculated by multiplying the energy use intensity numbers by the square footage of the prototype building. 2
