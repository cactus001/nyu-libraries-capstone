October 27, 1999 Core compensation has generated a lot of myths. Here are the 3 myths we've been hearing the most, along with the FACTS. MYTH #1: The Core Compensation Plan is going to be put in place sooner than April 2000. FACT: There are no plans to convert to the Core before April 2000. The FAA plans to convert on April 23, 2000. MYTH #2: Employees in bargaining units will never be covered by the Core Compensation Plan. FACT: The Core Compensation Plan will be the basis for all future management bargaining proposals for all bargaining units. However, bargaining unit members will not be converted to the Core Plan until an agreement is reached between their union and the agency. MYTH #3: The agency is planning to remove or reduce important employee benefits (such as, sick and annual leave, leave transfer program, overtime pay, alternate work schedules, holidays, jury duty or witness service, RIF protections, and/or military leave). FACT: The FAA is not planning to remove or reduce any of these benefits. When FAA was originally exempted from Title V, it had the opportunity to change these benefits because it was no longer required by law to maintain them. The agency chose to maintain these important benefits and has no plans to remove or reduce them. Need more Info? There are other myths out there, and a lot of questions.
