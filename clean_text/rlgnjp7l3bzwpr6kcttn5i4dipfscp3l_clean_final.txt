'Results of adequate therapy are highly predictable, and effectiveness is usually determined 'most efficiently from the rise in hemoglobin (5). Although blood ualues return rapidly to normal, iron therapy must be continued for extended periods of time in order to reconstitute the iron stores , in,the tissues.As. early as'1893 Blankenstein (19) suggested that the signifi- cance of iron-deficiency anemia may be important in the diagnosis. of clesions of the oral cavity. Suzman,(32) in 1933, reported an inves-,tigation.of the etiology of Plummer-Vinson Syndrome and its relation ship.to "idiopathic .hypochromic anemia". He acknowledged that the relaiioniip between anemia and 'the syndrome "had alwayS been p subject'of contention ". In 1938 Waldenstrom (34),expressed concern othae'the study of.so-called hypochromic anemia and syuptpms afflic- Ling epithelial tissues had not-aroused much interest. Darby (7) reflected in 1946 that recent interest in viCamin M complex deficienRies.ascauses of lesions of the budtal eissfies had led to the unjustified claim by many investigators that all such lesions were manifestations of vitamin deficiencies. It was claimed ,that 'changes in the lingual papillae were specifically due to niacin deficiency, and that glossitis was probably due to chronic niacin deficiency.It was airther implied that fissuies at the angles of tlse mouth (ckleilosis) were due to rihoflavindeficency, although it ''had been shown that these. lesions may heal.after administration of15

Schour .. t1and Massler (2.8) conclude from their studi4 of 'the effects of r-A dietary deficiencies oral structures that, "The oral manifesto- . .,tions of iron deficiency have, been given much less consideration than those of calcium deficiency and merit investigation."417 Suzman (32) studied eight cases of Plummer- Vinson Syndrome athe'Massachusetts General,Hospital over a period of two years. The'', patients were all women between, the ages of 27 and 61. Clinical yl features mahifested by these pati9ts-were: burning, red tongue r.twhich appeared atrophic, smooth and shiny, with fissures present.at- .the anglIs of the mouth; and dysphagia (tightness in thd esophagus). Six of the patients were found to have hemoglobin concentrations which ranged from 35 to 60' ,Pr cent at the initial examination. These six patients were given a prescribed daily treatment'of iron with ammonium citrate in concentrations ranging, from 3.8 grams to 6 grams.Treatments were continued for 'Periods' of time ranging from one to two months. ,'Final data were available \for four of these six patients whose hemoglobin concentrations were found to have increased fromp to 30 per Cent. Their overall physical conditions were improved, and there was marke improvement in the conditiong of1.the mouth and tongue.Suzman (32) reported a seventh patieit who w s found to-have.":marked'anemia,-and a hemoglobin concentration of only 15'kt Cent.

Her hemoglobin le el was 15.0 g/100'ml,demonstrating an increase of 2.5 g.

58 complete hemoglobin determinations were made showed at least some increase .inthe level following ferrous gfuconate treatment. Hemoglobin level. readings were incomplete for cases numbered six, . eight, and,eleven. The investigator was unable to procure any hemoglobin determinations for, case numbelr six. Casesnumber eight and number '11 reported oral conditions by way of telephonefot the second visit, and did, not report to the clinic for a second hemoglobin reading. It may be seen in Table 2 that the final assessment of the oral con- dition, which was made by the dental consultant at the final visit, is given in simple terms of improvement. Further eAaminacion of Tslble 2 ,discloses that nine of the 12 subjects for whom data "ere available (75(per cent) showed marked improvement in the oral conditions following treat- ment with ferrous gluconte. The thirteenth subject, case number 11, did knot return to the clinic for final evaluation but reported by telephone that she "felt fine". / (Two subjects, case number two and cage number eight, were the only two cases who showed no improvement in the oral conditions following the ferrous g:luconate treatment. In the "Report of Case Findings" it was indicated that there was doubt that case Chumber two ollowed instructions for medication properly, if at all, since she responded to 4. elephone call stating that she was' not foltowing the iron therapy prescribe for her.

Cause far his failure to.improveremains in doubt. Effects of Treatment ReAdered to 12 Subjectswithout Use of Ferrous Gluconate '.Subjects numbered 14 through 25 were treated without the use.ofAferrous glpconate. It is pointed out, that the therapeutic Management of oral lesions manifested in most of these subjects was attempted through use of Tetracycline mouthwash, Kenalog in Drabas.g, and in . one case, Zinc oxide. .Systemic steroids were used in three caseswhere lesionS were "too extensive, too deep, and too numerous, oin areas to which topical steroid ointment cannot be easily applied" (31).It Is emphasized that these drugs were given only as temporary medications, since they do not prevent oral lesions from recurring. The drugs do, however, reduce the pain and curtail the length of timeduring which lesions,will persist. Inspection of Table 3 reveals that the atypical oral conditions` exhibited by, these 12 subjects at the initial visit to the clinic int 1 u ded six subjecith aphthous ulcers, three subjects with Sutton's Disease, one subject with glossitis, and two subjects withcombinations of aphthous ulcers, Cheilosis, and glossitis. Hemoglobin levels at the initial visit to the clinic showed a range of 12.0 g to 15.0 g with. an average reading of 13.15 g., The, hemoglobin levels.P1at ale second visit of seven of the subjects for whop{ readings were61.0

These supplementsmay account for the fact that their hemoglobin levels were increasedmore than those of the other three subjects for whom readings weretaken.Hemoglobin level readings were incomplete for cases numbered '14,18, 19, 23, and 24 since the investigator was unable to securea second hemoglobin reading. The final assessment of the oral condition which was made bythe dental consultant at the 'subject's final visit to the clinic is e,given in table 3. Time periods during which subjects were observed, 511' _ .are shown to extend from a minimum of. two months to a makimum of 47months.It may be observed that only two subjects, case number 20and case number 22 showed marked improvement in oral conditions, andtwo additional subjects, cases 21 and 25 showed only moderate.improvement.Three of these subjects reporte4 that,they had'takenoral iron supplements independently, and the fourth subject was$ p're ctibedsteroids.It is not kntwn whether the three subjects , .AP.wool have shown improVement if they had not taken the oral iron(,\,.4.suppiements. !. * Thresubjects showed only slight improveMent, and two of'them,N ,,cases 17 and 18, reported that they had taken 1.itaMtns with irone63

Those subjects. in wiomthe hemoglobin was increased to a level of 13.4 g or higher, whether or not they received therapy with ferrous' gluconate, all showed at least some improvgment in oral conditions, Those patients whose hemoglobin levels at the last cl;ar visit were recorded at 12.9 gor lower showed no improvement in oral conditions. It has been stated previously that assessment of normal valuesfor hemoglobin has been asignated at levels ranging upwtrd from 13.5 g/100 ml.It seems reasonable to conclude that the findings of this investigation support the hypothesis that l!emoglobin lqvc1I-nt lower margin or,below the recognized minimum normal range may accom-N4.44/pany or promote the occurrence of oral lesions such as glossitis,aphthous ulcers and angular cheilOsis. It may be concluded furthers that as hemoglobin levels are increased, these oral conditions are , improved.' .The second hypothesis was that therapy with iron supplements will reduce or control tfe occurrence of glossitis, aphthous ulcers and angular cheilosis. Data availablefor 12 of the 13*subjects64

CHAPTER'VSUMMARY, CONCLUSiONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS a 4SummaryThe purpose bf the present study was to present an experimentalinvestigation of the manifestations of aphthous ulcers, glossitis,wv and cheilo8is in the oral cavities of 25 subjects, the use of ferrousat- gluconate supplements on the control of these lesiods in 13 selectedsubjects, and the hemoglobin levels at initial.and final clinic visitsofall subjects for time periods which varied Iromone month to fouryearS.The investigation was delimited to a study of subjects whowere solicited in the Gainesville, Florida area, or who were referred --, to thedental clinic of the'aCollege of Dentistry at phe University ofFlorida. -Selection of subjectswas ?invited to the judgment of 'thedental consultant who was preseht in the clinic at the time of the oinitial visit. His assessment of oral conditions. and selectionoftherapy preScribed were the final judgmentf.. Petermiw.tion of thehemoglobin level was made by the'inveStigator, a registered technolo-gist, and was limited to the use ofthe'cyanmethemoglobin.procedure.;. 'In order to accomplish the purposes of the study, th% followinghypotheseswere postulated:li' The hemoglobin level in the blood.is related to the occurrence:of such oral lesions as glossitis, aphthous ulcers, and angular cheilp-sis:6'6 64

65 Therapy with iron supplements will reduce or control the ti'. , occurrence of glossitis, aphthous ulcers, and angular cheilosis Terms were defined as their meanings were interpreted for use in the pr sentinvestigation.A thorough study and review of related .literature was made, and it was revealed that few studies have at t._tempted the investigation 6flthe occurrence of these oral lesions with the possible relatedness of hemoglobin levels, and the effects of therapy with only iron supplements.. Data which support this experimental investigation"Were provided by theeparticipation of 13 subjects who-were selected by the dental consultant to receive ferrous gluconate suplements during the experi mental period, and by 12 subjects who received no ferrous,ilconate treatment.Clinical, laboratory, and deriptiv datg were obtained at thesublet's initialiand final visits. All data were:tabulated and summarized for purposes of comparison and interpretation of the findings.Interpretations were made with particular reference to apparent relationships between the hemoglobin level and periodic occurrence and reduction of oral manifestations of aphthous- ulcers, .glossitis and angular theilosis. °*1 Conclusions On the basis, of the findings, and.within the limitations posed in the present Avesttion, the following conclusions .;1;;.4c-41ade: Presence of the drat sions of aphthous ulcers, glossitis and cheilosis does not appear to be significantly related to hemoglobi levels which fall well within the generally accepted normal limits. 1V2.Although hemoglobin levels may fall within the generally.67 4

.....6.6 %144 accepted normal 1. its, ferrous gluconate supplements have a profound effect, upon reversal of established oral lesions and the prevention of recurrences. Hemoglobin levels which are at the lower limits, or below 1/4,Alk the recognized minimum normal range seem to accompany or promote the occurrence of oral lesions such as glossitis, aphthous ulcers and %angular cheilosis, and as hemoglobin leVels are increased, the oral conditions areimproved/ t.4.Eemales appear to have a tendency toward occurrence of iron deficiency more often than males, especially during the Childbearingt., years, and therefore show more ,frequent Manifestatiens of pral lesions apparently related. to the hemoglobin level in-the blood.1 When ferrous gluconate supplements are prescribed for the Management of oral lesions such as aphthous ulcers, glossixis and cheilosis, subjects show' inareaS4 in hemoglobin determinations, and the majority show marked improvement in the oral conditions following treatment. When ferrous gluconate supplements are not prescribed for the management of, Oral'lesions such as aphthous ulcers, :glossitis and ,cheilosis, subjects show no improvement in the oral conditions.47.Although the regular intake iron supplements is not recom, mended, it appears that some subjects require daily supplements until theltsionsresolve, and,some subjects require,daily supplements, indefinitely.
