1 Statement of Mark Laven President and CEO, Latham International on behalf of The Association of Pool & Spa Professionals U.S. Senate Committee on Commer ce, Science and Transportation Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, Product Safety & Insurance May 3, 2006 Chairman Allen and distinguished members of the Subcommittee: My name is Mark Laven, President and CEO of Latham International, the leading manufacturer of in-ground swimming pools in North America. Latham is a 50 year-old company with 1200 employees at 20 manufacturing locations in the U. S. and Canada. Like many in the pool and spa industry, I am the third generation of my family to be associated with my company, and with the industry. In many ways, we ar e a family-oriented industry. Today, I am testifying on behalf of The Association of Pool & Spa Professionals, APSP, the international trade association of the pool and spa industry. In this regard, when I use the term “we,” I am referring to APSP and the industry as a whole, not my company. We, collectively, thank the Subcommittee for holding this hearing, highlighting the critical importance of pool safety, particularly during National Safe Kids Week. We have part icipated in events sponsored by Safe Kids Worldwide and others to educate caregivers on pool safety measures. Safety is a core belief and commitment of this industry, and we appreciate the opportunity to participate here today. Our industry touches millions of people. In th is country alone, there are approximately 7 million in-ground pools, many with adjoin ing spas, 3.6 million above-ground pools, and 4 million portable hot tubs in use today. Briefly, APSP, formerly NSPI, the National Sp a and Pool Institute, is headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, and has approximately 4500 members, largely in North America. Its members are comprised of pool, spa and equipm ent manufacturers, builders, distributors, retailers and service companies, and their employees. Associated members include public health officials, building code officials and others with an interest in the pool and spa industry, and aquatics in general. Membership is voluntary, but all members agree, by a Code of Ethics, “to contribute to the health, safety and welfare of the public in the installation, maintenance and operation of swimming pools, spas and hot tubs, and to comply with applicable laws, ordinances and regulations.” Since its inception, APSP has been committed to promoting the safe and enjoyable use of pools and spas, as have many of its members, includi ng my own firm, Latham In ternational. In this statement, I’d like to summarize how we carry out this commitment. Additional detail is provided in the Appendix we have submitted for the record.

2APSP and the industry promote safety by advocati ng widespread use of pool and spa Standards approved by ANSI, the American National Standa rds Institute, and by education, training and disseminating safety information. ANSI-Approved Pool and Spa Standards Currently, APSP and the industry support compre hensive pool and spa construction and design Standards. These Standards are developed in acco rdance with the rigorous third-party consensus review process of ANSI. Eight Standards are in effect, and one additional Standard is pending. A principal purpose of these Standards is the prev ention of three major concerns of pool safety-- drownings, diving accidents and suction entrapment. The ANSI Standards are continually reviewed and revised to reflect new methods and technologies that enhance safety. We advocate th eir widespread use with in the industry, and we continue to promote their adopti on by state and local officials. Education and Safety Information We emphasize safety in many educational settings , at national and local levels both within and outside of the industry. APSP has developed co mprehensive educational manuals and offers training and certification in both pool construction and servicing. Recognizing the critical need to deliver safety information directly to pool and spa owners and parents, APSP’s consumer awareness and public outreach programs feature a wide array of brochures and publications, with t itles like “Important Safety Information” and “Children Aren’t Waterproof.” All of these are availabl e to the public at no charge by calling 800.323.3996, APSP’s toll-free consumer contact number. Four related APSP websites further ex tend safety outreach to the public. TheAPSP.org, PoolPeopleUSA.com and HotTubLiving.com all contain important wa ter safety information, and a special site for kids, SplashZoneUSA.com, teaches water safety with online fun and games. Safety is also highlighted in TV and radio public service announcements. Many individual companies within the industry, in cluding my own, emphasize safety repeatedly through our own websites, company training and customer education programs, publications, sales literature, pr oduct packaging and safety signage. Of course, the purpose of all these efforts is to prevent accidents and fata lities from occurring. It would be ideal if we could guarantee safety in all instances. In real ity, we cannot; no industry can make that guarantee. For example, all the precautions in the world will not protect an intoxicated person who dives reck lessly, head-first, into the shallow end of a pool. Statistics do tell us, however, that while pool and spa use is rising, the rate of drownings is declining, and we believe that public awareness education is a major contributing factor. However, this is no comfort when a tragic loss occurs. Our goal rema ins to help make sure that each and every person who enjoys the use of pools and spas does so safely.
