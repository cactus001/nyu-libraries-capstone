APPROVED Public Markets Committee 2 February 3, 2009 REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF MI NUTES – DECEMBER 2, 2008 Mr. Masten moved to adopt the December 2, 2008, Public Markets Committee minutes. Mr. Petit seconded, and the motion carried unanimously. INDEX-RELATED PRODUCTS MANAGER PRESENTATION Mr. Thatcher introduced himself and reviewed the process and results of the index-related products search. The current non-U.S. index contra ct with State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) expires March 31, 2009. Many of the WSIB progr ams use passive indexi ng, including defined benefit and defined contribution programs as well as qualified and nonqualified portfolios. Indexing is used to gain broad based equity exposure at the lowest possible cost. Callan Associates assisted WSIB staff with this sear ch. The search process was similar to the one conducted for U.S. indexes in 2007 to provide the WSIB with access to all index-related products offered by the firm. The primary focus will be non-U.S. equity products. Because of its size, the WSIB requires significant capac ity from any index-related manager. Only two investment firms met the minimum re quirements of the search: SSgA and Barclays Global Investors (BGI). Both firms exhibited strengths and a dvantages and scored well during the evaluation; neither had major weaknesses. While both firms are very competent managers of index products, three main factors contribut ed to the staff’s recommendation of SSgA over BGI: (1) Incumbency—as the incumbent, SSgA has served the WSIB in this role for the past 13 years. Securities lending is imbedded into the index process and, b ecause of the liquidity and volatility challenges in the current market, changing from one index provider and securities lending pool to another may cause si gnificant turmoil and cost to the defined benefit portfolio as well as Plan 3 and DCP participants. (2) Dive rsification—the WSIB be nefits from having two separate and different index providers. This al so limits some operational and investment risks by not concentrating all passive mandates with one firm. (3) Performance—SSgA’s performance record has been good and they have added between 20 and 40 basis points annualized over various time periods. There is no compelling reason to transition from SSgA and staff’s recommendation is to award the new contract to them as the incumbent non-U.S. index manager. Mr. Thatcher addressed the recent media attent ion that SSgA’s parent company, State Street Corporation (SSC), has receive d regarding their recent fourth quarter 2008 announcement of a 71 percent drop in profits and disc ussed steps that have been take n to assure that the WSIB’s holdings with SSgA are not affected by any pot ential credit rating downg rade of the parent company. Mr. Thatcher also reviewed the differe nces between investing in a commingled fund versus separate account. Investi ng in commingled funds for non-U.S. equity is preferred as they offer an easy platform for large-scale investme nts into many international markets, low cost access and economies of scale, low cost trading opportunities, and lower management fees and administration costs. He also discussed the additional characteristic s of commingled funds wherein the manager votes the pr oxies and exercises any class ac tion litigation rights as well as the role of securities lending in the investment management of index funds.

APPROVED Public Markets Committee 3 February 3, 2009 Discussion ensued regarding benchmarks, secur ities lending, and proxy voting. The Committee also discussed further due diligence to ensure that losses at a compa ny’s parent organization would not prevent WSIB from having access to ou r funds and or impair the safety of the WSIB’s assets under all foreseeable circumstances. Mr. Brakke, Ms. Blake, Mr. Trem blay, and Mr. Motley introduced themselves. Mr. Tremblay provided an organizational overview and discusse d recent market challenges and the effect on SSC. SSgA is one of the three core businesses of SSC. Mr. Tremblay reviewed assets under management and steps SSC and SSgA have taken in response to the current market environment. There has been no personnel turnov er associated with any of the accounts SSgA manages on the WSIB’s behalf and the parent co mpany continues to reinvest resources in SSgA in order to better se rve client needs. Mr. Brakke reviewed the global structured products group and stra tegies. Indexing is a core business for SSgA and a significant part of th eir total revenue. He reviewed the team, organizational structure, strategies, a nd assets under management by strategy. Ms. Blake reviewed SSgA’s non-U.S. index experi ence including separate country funds, diverse client base, results, and assets under manageme nt. She provided an overview of various SSgA non-U.S. index strategies including index st ructure and methodology as well as portfolio construction and performance. Mr. Motley discussed securities lending and provided an overview of SSgA’s cash management by security type and asset backed securities a llocation. He reviewed SSgA’s cash collateral investment management objectives, process, an d philosophy and discussed current challenges and opportunities. Mr. Motley re viewed the summary characteristics of SSgA’s securities lending funds. Discussion ensued regarding the uncertainty of r ecent market events, deterioration of the global economy, U.S. unemployment expectations and tie in with asset backed securities, depth of recession, and unintended consequences from government intervention. Mr. Masten moved that the P ublic Markets Committee recommend the Board approve the selection of St ate Street Global Advisors as an index-related products investment manager for the WSIB, with a focus on non-U.S. index-related pro ducts, subject to final negotiations of terms, conditions, and fees. Mr. Petit seconded the motion. The Committee and staff discusse d appropriate safeguards surroundi ng protection of fund assets. It was agreed that as part of the “final negot iations of terms,” WSIB staff from investments and contracts would work with legal counsel from th e Attorney General’s office and outside counsel if necessary to ensure that the contract contains appropriate word ing to protect the fund’s assets. The motion carried unanimously. [The Committee recessed at 2:22 p.m. and reconvened at 2:32 p.m.]
