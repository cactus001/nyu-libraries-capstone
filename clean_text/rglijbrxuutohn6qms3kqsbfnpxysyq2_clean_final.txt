Pence On "Hannity's America," Discusses ACORN and Future of GOP Congressman Pence, in a rare in-studio appearance, was on the FOX News program " Hannity 's America " to discuss ACORN and the future of the Republican Party: On ACORN : HANNITY: First of all, you know, Obama also - we forget this part of the story. He gave $800,000 for the Get Out the Vote effort by ACORN. He was the lawyer for ACORN. PENCE: Right. HANNITY: You know, he wouldn't commit for cutting off funding for ACORN, even the House and Senate did both those things. You think they'll still try to backdoor money for them? PENCE: Well, I think that's a genuine concern that many of us have particularly after the president about a week ago said that he wasn't aware that ACORN was receiving a large amount of federal money and given. HANNITY: Tens of millions. 1 / 4

Pence On "Hannity's America," Discusses ACORN and Future of GOP PENCE: And given the president's background in organization supported by ACORN that was a little bit hard to take, to say the least. Look the American people recognize this is a discredited organization. It is, as House Republicans produced in our report last summer, it is what amounts in many respects to a criminal conspiracy using federal tax dollars to engage in direct election hearing and other activities, and it needs to be defunded. I was encouraged to even see Barney Frank, one of the historic defenders of ACORN, last week say they don't deserve another penny. And I think. HANNITY: Well, they've gotten tens of millions. They earmarked the stimulus that the president signed, how much were they scheduled there, because I read anywhere between $4 and $8.5 billion. PENCE: Right. But it's also important to remember, Barney Frank's departure from ACORN is important. Back when I was chairman of the House conservative caucus, Barney Frank was trying to get, I think, back in 2006 a piece of what was called the affordable housing fund. He was trying to get a big chunk of that slush fund which would have been literally hundreds of millions of dollars that could have flowed into ACORN. So this has been one of ACORN's strongest allies. HANNITY: Right. PENCE: For him to say it's time to cut off the funding, I think suggests t he American people have had it. On The GOP : HANNITY: Let me move on to another topic because you're viewed as one of the real 2 / 4

Pence On "Hannity's America," Discusses ACORN and Future of GOP up-and-coming conservative leaders in the House. Let's just step back a little bit. Leading into the 2006, 2008 elections there were conservatives like me that felt the Republican Party had abandoned some of their conservative values. Was that true? PENCE: I think it was true. I think we didn't just lose our majority in 2006. I think we lost our way. We walked away from the principles of limited government, fiscal discipline and reform that minted our national governing majority in 1980 and in 1994, and the American people walked away from us. *** HANNITY: What do you think the Republicans should do if they want to regain control of the House and get rid of Nancy Pelosi? PENCE: The first thing we need to do is - you know, Winston Churchill said the purpose of the opposition is to oppose every time principle demands, and you've seen Republicans since the first of this year, every single House Republican voted against the so-called stimulus bill. Every single House Republican voted against the president's budget. Almost all of us oppose the cap-and-trade bill, and I think every single House Republican is going to vote against this health care bill. So I think, first, we've got to provide that opposition to these government takeovers, to the borrowing and spending and bailout that's driving people to town hall meetings and drove over a million people here to Washington, D.C. But, secondly, after you oppose you do have to propose. And I will assure you people go to GOP.gov, they can see the solutions that have been developed on all the issues I just mentioned, but come next year, just watch. House Republicans are going to steal a playbook from the past and offer the American people a bright line contrast of agendas with the big government liberalism of this administration. *** PENCE: [T]he point is. Republicans have to offer the American people a choice, not an echo next year, and I believe we will. But right now, I want to tell you, you said something a little bit earlier. You said that we'd see these elections in Virginia that might go the Republicans' way, and New Jersey the same, and then health care. 3 / 4

Pence On "Hannity's America," Discusses ACORN and Future of GOP Stay tuned, Sean. The word we're getting on Capitol Hill is that Democrats would like to send this massive government takeover of health care to the president's desk even before those elections. And Americans who are looking in tonight ought to be aware now is not the time to come off the accelerator, we need to stay engaged. 4 / 4
