Ohio to Celebrate 200th Birthday March 1 The state that gave the world flight, eight Presidents, the first person to walk on the moon, and the nation's top 2002 college football team turns 200 on March 1. On that day, the Ohio Bicentennial Commission kicks off an eight-month celebration with a day of activities to celebrate Statehood Day. The day's events will take place in historic Chillicothe, the siteof the state capital when Ohio entered the Union in 1803. Ohio will celebrate its 200th Birthday with a variety of activities, including a prayer breakfast, a black-tie ball, a special joint session of the Ohio General Assembly, the re-creation of an 1803village, the first day issuance of a U.S. Postal Service stamp recognizing Ohio statehood, and there-opening of Adena, the home of Thomas Worthington, recognized as the Father of Ohio Statehood. Statehood Day is just the start of a months-long celebration that will reach every corner of Ohio. Other activities will include a Tall Ships festival on the Lake Erie coastline in July, a re-enactment ofa wagon train cross the state in June and July, a riverboat festival on the Ohio River in October, anda month-long celebration of the centennial of flight in Dayton in July. The celebration will alsoinclude two days of fireworks, and entertainment in Columbus July 3-4. These activities will happen on top of other projects that the Ohio Bicentennial Commission has undertaken over the past several years. One ongoing project will see 250-pound bronze BicentennialBells cast in 41 Ohio Counties. This project began in 2001 as a partnership between the BicentennialCommission and the Verdin Company of Cincinnati, Ohio's oldest family-owned manufacturer.When completed, the project will have cast a personalized bell in each of Ohio's 88 counties duringa two-day, out-in-the-open event. Another enormously popular program has seen the Bicentennial Commission paint its logo on a barn in each Ohio County. The barn paintings have become extremely popular, with hundreds ofOhioans cris-crossing the state to visit and photograph all 88 barns. In addition, the Ohio Department of Public Safety (ODPS) began distributing the bicentennial plate in October 2001. The ODPS sold 1,384,013 bicentennial plates in 2001. In 2002, therewere 3,629, 611 plates sold. More than 5 million platesare now on the road advertising the bicentennial year. Community-based bicentennial celebrations will take place in the form of 40 Commission-funded Legacy Projects,which include antique car rallies, exhibits, living historyperformances and lecture series in different parts aroundthe state. A full list of all bicentennial activities, including a monthly Calendar of Events, is available at the Ohio BicentennialCommission Web site, www.ohio200.com. Look for Signature Events.

The color is white. The reason is visibility. On February 14, 2003, the Ohio State Highway Patrol (OSHP) premiered its new Patrol cruiser at the an-nual awards banquet in Columbus. The Trooper of the Year, Sgt. Matthew R. Crow, received the first one and each district will be given one new car. Gradually, the other charcoal gray cars will be phased out, usually when acar reaches 85,000 miles, which is approximately 33 months of service. Itwill take several years to change over the 1,200 marked Patrol cars. The current dark color tends to blend in with roads during the day and can't be seen at night. The death of two troopers in less than three years is afactor in the switch. Trooper Robert Perez was completing paperwork ona routine traffic stop on the Ohio Turnpike in Sandusky when a speeding car hit the cruiser from behind and killed him on May 15, 2000. On November 5, 2001, Trooper Frank Vazquez was approaching a car on Interstate 270 in Columbus when a sport utility vehicle hit him, the cruiser and the car he stopped. Vazquez died the next day. Patrol cruisers were white from 1970 until 1981. They became silver in 1983 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Patrol. In1992, the cars became charcoal. The decision to change colors was made last September, after the first Patrol Car Committee meeting. Committee members met one evening toobserve a patrol car demonstration in a parking lot on the state fairground.Headed by Major Robert Cassidy, the other members included Lt. Col.Michael W. Finamore, Capt. Lisa Taylor, Lt. Jim Wernecke, Lt. Brian Charles, Lt. Rick Fambro, Lt. C. Lance Mathess, MCES Milan Orbovich, Sgt. Kay Perkins, Sgt. Walter Davis, Sgt. Dennis Lee, Fleet Mgr. Joe Price, Sgt. JohnRinko, Tpr. Kenneth Metz, and Tpr. Mark Neff. The consensus of the committee was that the white Crown Victoria pro- vided far superior visibility at night when compared to the current issue graypatrol car. The new white cruisers will continue to move the Patrol in thedirection of providing troopers with the safest, most reliable, and best equip- ment available.Effective January 1, 2003, the deputy registrar fee increased from$2.75 to $3.25. A provision of the State's general revenue budget bill (HB 94), provided for an annual re-view of deputy registrars for the purpose of determining fees which will be paid to transact driver li-cense and vehicle registration functions on behalf of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV). The feeis collected to reimburse deputy registrars for their expenses in per- forming driver and vehicle registra-tion services on behalf of the state. Deputy registrars and their em- ployees are not state employees. The 50-cent increase is the result of the deputy registrars receivinga statewide satisfaction rating of 90-percent or better on surveys conducted by The Ohio State Uni-versity. The study focused on thedelivery of services to Ohioans by the 215 deputy registrar agencies. The BMV's Registrar stated that theresults of the study are encourag- ing and confirm that the BMV is moving in the right direction withtheir customer focused approach. According to the survey, 90 percent of respondents reported a favor-able opinion regarding the perfor- mance of the BMV and 93 percent indicated that the Deputy RegistrarAgency they visited met or ex- ceeded their expectations of qual- ity customer care. The deputy registrar fee is used in transactions dealing with vehicleregistrations, out-of-state inspec- tions, driver licenses, state identi- fication cards and endorsementissuances. The fee increase will affect transactions completed through the deputy registrars, mail,phone and Internet.Performance Ratings of Deputy Registrars Lead to Fee IncreasePATROL CARS CRUISE TO A NEW COLOR 1934 Chevy1934 Chevy1934 Chevy1934 Chevy1934 Chevy1938 Con1938 Con1938 Con1938 Con1938 Con vvvvv..... 1949 Ford1949 Ford1949 Ford1949 Ford1949 Ford 1957 Chevy1957 Chevy1957 Chevy1957 Chevy1957 Chevy 1970 Plymouth1970 Plymouth1970 Plymouth1970 Plymouth1970 Plymouth1993 Ford1993 Ford1993 Ford1993 Ford1993 Ford 2001 Ford2001 Ford2001 Ford2001 Ford2001 Ford 2003 Ford2003 Ford2003 Ford2003 Ford2003 Ford

Baby Boomers Are Aging The Excellence in Service (ESA) Awards ceremony was held on January 8, 2003, in the Shipley Building Atrium. The followingemployees received awards: ESA Awards for Fourth Quarter According to a study that appeared in the August issue of the American Journal of Public Health , by the year 2030, about 7 million baby boomersage 85 and older will have stopped driving and will be forced to rely on other forms of transportation. With this dependency comes a host of issues for baby boomer familiesand society in general. The study says that more than 600,000 Americans stop driving each year. This numberis expected to rise sharply as baby boomers begin to retire. Seniors stop driving because of poor eyesight, memory problems or other health-related problems that make itdifficult for them to get behind the wheel, according to Jeff Runge, the administrator for the National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). It becomes harder for older people to rely on bus transportation because they may have trouble walking to thebus stop. Some communities have begun offering services that provide curb-to-curb service; but in manyplaces, seniors have to rely on family and friends. Runge suggests that adult children take a hard look at the situation be- fore a crisis occurs and says it is of-ten a person's doctor that can assess the situation and help tell the older person they are no longer fit to drive.
