Oklahoma Water Research Institute Annual Technical Report FY 2002 Introduction The Environmental Institute at Oklahoma State University has as its mission to serve as a center for stimulation and promotion of interdisciplinary research, graduate education and public education relating to understanding, protecting, utilizing and sustaining the natural environment. The University Center for Water Research (UCWR) is an integral part of the Institutes research efforts and is responsible for developing and coordinating water research funded through two programs: Oklahoma Water Resources Research Institute (OWRRI) funded by the Department of the Interior through the U.S. Geological Survey and the Water Research Center, (WRC) funded by the State of Oklahoma. The primary objective of the UCWR is the promotion of research of water related issues that are not only of national and regional concern, but also address the needs of Oklahoma. The federally supported Oklahoma Water Resources Research Institute is one of 54 Water Institutes created under Section 104 of the Water Resources Research Act. In Fiscal Year 2002, the $84,785 grant to the OWRRI was used to support four research projects and water research administration and development activities as well as the information transfer program. The three research projects supported by the OWRRI program are as follows: Project 2002OK2B Springs in Peril: Have Changes in Groundwater Input Affected Oklahoma Springs? assessed the status of Oklahoma springs with respect to groundwater input, and the effects of altered groundwater flow rates on spring biota. Project 2002OK3B Enhanced Life Cycle Assessment: Analysis to Guide Environmental Technology Implementation develops an enhanced life cycle assessment (ECLA) framework for the integrated assessment of the implementation of environmental technologies. Project 2002OK4B Resistance Tomographic Imaging, Digital Mapping and Immersion Visualization of Evaporite Karst in Western Oklahoma investigates a novel and innovative procedure that combines electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), digital mapping and immersion visualization hardware and software to provide a digital image of subsurface conduit networks in a karst environment. Project 2002OK6B Evaluating Cost Effective Technologies to Reduce Phosphorous Loading to Surface Waters in the Ozark Region develops methods that will aid watershed managers in the Ozark and similar regions to set and implement TMDLs in a cost effective manner.

1 Problem and Research Objectives Problem. Groundwater is an extremely important commodity to Oklahoma, with heavy use by agriculture, industry, municipalities, and private landowners. Groundwater is also critical for wildlife and for maintaining the high -quality outdoors environment of Oklahoma, especially through the influence of groundwater on springs and on stream flows. Springs, by definition, are the locations where groundwater emerges and becomes surface water. As a habitat, springs share the charact eristics of both underground waters (nearly constant temperatures and water flow, and low oxygen concentration) and surface waters (light and algal growth, inputs of dead plant material, and the water -air interface which allows gas exchange and colonizatio n by flying insects). Typically, springs have a characteristic fauna that may include certain fishes and a predominance of non -flying invertebrates, such as snails and flatworms. The extensive use of groundwater in Oklahoma and surrounding states may redu ce water levels in some Oklahoma aquifers, with consequent partial or complete dewatering of the associated springs. In fact, springs provide an excellent point to monitor quantitative and qualitative changes in groundwater resources. Such reduction in spr ing flows may adversely affect the plants and animals living in spring, especially those species that are spring specialists. The flow of streams associated with springs may also be adversely affected by groundwater use. Recently, there have been two prop osed large -scale water sales projects in Oklahoma. Although neither sale has gone through, both are still possible and these potential sales highlight the growing value of Oklahoma water. The first sale would involve water extracted from southeastern Oklah oma and sold to Texas. Although the sale would involve only surface stream flow, the interaction between streams and groundwater could also affect alluvial aquifers (= aquifers associated with streams and rivers). The second proposed water sale would invo lve the direct extraction of groundwater from the Arbuckle -Simpson aquifer, a process that would almost certainly affect the springs and spring -fed streams in this area. These streams and springs are used by local municipalities and have very high recreati onal value. Original objectives: This research will addresses (1) the flow status of springs in Oklahoma, and (2) the effects of altered flow rates on spring biota. Discharge data and invertebrate surveys from 50 springs collected in 1981 -1982 (existing d ata from a previous OWRRI project; Matthews et al.1983) and in 2001 -2002 (this project) are being used to assess changes in groundwater discharge into springs and indicate how any changes may affect the invertebrate fauna of springs. Specific objectives o f the project are: A. Estimate the extent of groundwater flow changes into springs throughout Oklahoma.

--- Page 3 ---
2 B. Determine if changes in spring conditions over the past 20 years have affected spring invertebrate communities. C. Determine whether some types or locations o f springs are more susceptible to flow reduction than other springs. D. Identify possible indicator species that either appear or disappear in flow -impacted springs. E. Increase the knowledge base of the biodiversity and distribution of spring -dwelling invertebr ates. F. Train one graduate student to work on the springs of Oklahoma. G. ‘Re-use’ data from the project by adding data to the OBS database, to be used, for example, in future research projects by external researchers. H. Disseminate information and results in a f inal report, by developing a project website, presenting results at one or more meetings, and writing one manuscript. Added objectives. In addition to sampling invertebrates at each spring, fish were collected, when present. Fish were collected in the 198 1-1982 study and their inclusion in this study adds to the information gained about changes in the biota over the 20 -year period. Fish were not included in the original proposal because there was insufficient time to obtain the required approval for resear ch involving vertebrates by the University of Oklahoma. Approval has since been obtained. Additionally, the study was expanded to include about 20 additional springs, with emphasis on sampling springs that were in areas underrepresented in the original 50 springs study. Also, because spring -owner questionnaires were found to be a good method of indicating possible flow changes over time, questionnaires were sent to a large number of spring owners. Methodology The study hinges on the comparison of two dat asets of spring surveys, one collected in 1981 -1982 and the other collected in 2001. In order to have comparable surveys, the methods used in the 2001 springs survey closely followed those of the previous survey. Descriptions of the methods used in the 198 1-1982 surveys are found in the final project report (Matthews et al. 1983), manuscripts (Matthew et al. 1985), and in the field notes from the project. Field sites. The 50 spring sites were originally selected because they had enough flow to be used as a water supply (with a few exceptions), were good sites for monitoring particular aquifers, and had landowner permission for privately owned sites. The 50 sites are located in 29 Oklahoma counties (Figure 1) and in 8 aquifers. As in the earlier survey, sp rings were surveyed during the summer. Data and samples collected at each spring included:

--- Page 4 ---
3 • A description of the spring site. This description included a diagram of the spring, directions to re -locate the site, GPS readings, and information on local land u se, alterations to the spring, and the vegetation in and near the spring. • Measurement of several physical and chemical parameters: including, pH; water temperature; conductivity; water widths, depths, and velocities. Discharge (the quantity of water flow per time, as liters per second) was calculated from the last three variables. • Sampling for aquatic invertebrates. Qualitative sampling followed the 1981 -1982 sampling protocol and included dip -netting, picking organisms off stones, and collecting leaf pack s, which were preserved and later searched for invertebrates in the laboratory. Additionally, 3 to 6 core samples (diameter = 10.2 cm) were collected at each site. Invertebrate samples were preserved in 70% ethyl alcohol. • Sampling for fish. Springs were se ined with a fine -meshed (3 mm openings) seine and representatives of each species caught were preserved in 10% formaldehyde. The majority of captured fish were released. Figure 1. Location of the 50 springs sampled in 1981 -82 and in 2001. The calculated discharge of each spring during the 2001 sampling is indicated by the symbol marking each spring (see legend).

Fish samples were rinsed of formaldehyde, identified by Dr William Matthews (Curator of Fishes, Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, University of Oklahoma), and transferred to 70% ethyl alcohol. The fish samples will be deposited in the fish collection at the SNOMNH. Invertebrates in the invertebrate samples have been sorted from the substrates and divided into broad taxonomic categories. Chironomids and crayfish are mostly identified and identification of other invertebrates is on going. Questionnaires. Owner questionnaires were used to identify springs whose flow patterns had altered over time. Questionnaires were not completed for all sites, especially sites on public lands. Some questionnaires were of little value because own ers had recently purchased the property or were not very familiar with their spring. Principal Findings and Significance Data on spring flows and changes in flow between 1981 and 2001 were reported in the 2001 -2 annual report and are not repeated here . Changes in spring flow over time were accessed for an additional 35 spring locations using questionnaires (no previous flow data were available for these locations). Of these springs, owners reported reductions in flow at 4 locations; no change was r eported at 25 locations and owners did not know at 6 locations. Reductions in flow were associated

--- Page 6 ---
5 with increased groundwater use for irrigation (2 spring locations) and siltation of the spring (2 spring locations) by their owners. The four springs wit h reduced flow were primarily alluvial springs (in Cimarron, Custer, Greer and Woods Counties), although the Greer and Woods County sites may have been associated with bedrock aquifers (Dog Creek Shale & Blaine Gypsum Aquifer and Cedar Hills Sandstone Aqui fer, respectively). This supports last year’s finding that alluvial aquifers sometimes have flow -impacted springs. The 2001 results indicated reduced flows in springs associated with the Ogallala Aquifer in Cimarron County. A second map series (Johnson 1983) indicates that the sampled Cimarron County sites are alluvial springs and are independent of the Ogallala Aquifer and, hence, no Ogallala springs in the Oklahoma panhandle were sampled. In contrast, 2 Ogallala -source springs were sampled in Roger Mi lls County and no evidence of reduced spring flow was found. Hence, this study showed no evidence of impacted flow of Ogallala aquifers in Oklahoma (although only 2 Ogallala -associated springs were sampled). Of the 50 springs sampled in 1981 and 2001, 20 contained fish, 36 contained crayfish, and 10 contained neither fish nor crayfish. Of the additional 24 springs sampled in 2002 - 3, only three contained fish and eight contained crayfish. The additional 24 springs tended to have lower flow and be more we stern that the original set of 50 springs. The occurrences of fish and crayfish were associated with flow. In the 50 -springs dataset, mean flow of fish -containing springs was 34.6 L/s, mean flow of crayfish - containing springs was 14.4 L/s, and mean flo w of springs with neither fish nor crayfish was 1.0 L/s. Fish composition in springs was associated with the particular aquifer (the source of water) and with the contained watershed (the conduit of fish travel). Eleven species of crayfish were col lected in springs in 2001 -3. This amounts to 41% of the known non -cave-dwelling crayfish species in the state. Crayfish were not identified in the 1981 -2 study, so comparisons with the earlier dataset are limited. Although the fish faunas in most sprin gs changed little over between 1981 and 2001, a few springs had large changes. These changes were either (1) a reduction in diversity (or apparent loss of fish) that resulted from erosion/siltation, spring drying, or flow diversion or, less commonly, (2) a n increase in diversity because of impoundment of the spring and fish stocking and colonization of the resultant pond. Significance. No evidence of recent reduced flow was found for the majority of the approximately 70 springs included in the 2 -year study . Most springs with apparent reduced flows were associated with various alluvial aquifers, the Trinity Aquifer, or the Vamoosa Aquifer.

--- Page 7 ---
6 Possible reasons for reductions in spring flows include local increases in groundwater - based irrigation, direct modific ations to the spring (e.g., construction of a forestry road over the spring), and land -use effects (e.g., farming and livestock operations resulting in siltation of the spring). Springs in Oklahoma support a diverse group of organisms, including several s pecies of fish, crayfish, and salamanders, and a variety of crustaceans and insects. Based on the relationship between spring flows and fish presence, reduced flows in springs would likely result in reduced fish diversity and, if flow is sufficiently redu ced, the loss of fish from affected springs.

Enhanced Life Cycle Assessment Demonstration at the Tar Creek Superfund Site Basic Information Title:Enhanced Life Cycle Assessment Demonstration at the Tar Creek Superfund Site Project Number: 2002OK3B Start Date:3/1/2001 End Date:2/28/2003 Funding Source: 104B Congressional District:Oklahoma 1st,3rd,4th Research Category:Social Sciences Focus Category: Law, Institutions, and Policy, Economics, None Descriptors:Integrated environmental decision-making, risk assessment, benefit-cost analysis, life-cycle assessment, stakeholder processes Principal Investigators:Robert P Anex, Will J Focht, Chad Settle Publication

Problem and Research Objectives : The proposed research will develop an Enhanced Life -Cycle Assessment (ELCA) framework for the assessment of environmental technologies that will be demonstrated by assessing the life -cycle costs and benefits, risks, and sta keholder acceptability of using treatment wetlands for cleanup and restoration at the Tar Creek Superfund site. Our overall objective is to develop a systematic process for environmental technology assessment that accounts explicitly for the interdependenc e among changes in releases of pollutants, human health risks, and economic impacts throughout the technology life cycle, and that is guided by stakeholder concerns and preferences regarding environmental management and pollution control. Specific goals o f the proposed research include: i) development of methods of assessing stakeholder concerns and preferences suitable for guiding policy -relevant analyses; ii) to integrate risk assessment and benefit -cost analysis methods with life -cycle assessment tech niques; iii) to demonstrate the ELCA framework by producing policy -relevant data regarding the costs, benefits, risks, and stakeholder acceptability of using treatment wetlands at the Tar Creek Superfund site; and iv) to identify priority information nee ds of the decision -making process to help guide future scientific research. Methodology : The process of making environmental decisions involving health, societal, and economic issues is most commonly supported by three types of analysis: benefit -cost anal ysis (BCA), life -cycle assessment (LCA), and human health risk assessment. This project is advancing these analytic methods by integrating them into a coherent ELCA framework. The ELCA framework is both an integrated set of analysis tools that support th e policymaking process as well as a procedure that involves stakeholders in defining the analysis process and therefore involves them in a critical part of policymaking. Involving stakeholders in the analysis process is important because stakeholders will not support a policy decision that they do not feel is fully legitimate. The ELCA framework is being used to assess the technical effectiveness of the enhanced wetland technology in reducing human health risk through an integrated LCA and risk assessment process. The risk assessment process is guided by input from stakeholders gathered through survey and interviews. Benefit -Cost Analysis (BCA) is being used to assess the net benefit of the proposed use of treatment wetlands at the Tar Creek site. Incorpo rating BCA within the ELCA framework assures that the market and non -market site characteristics that are evaluated and included in the analysis are those that are important to the stakeholders and not simply those that an analyst thinks should be importan t. The BCA is also guided by the results of stakeholder interviews, Q sorts, and surveys. Stakeholder acceptability is being assessed from interviews with stakeholders residing or working near the proposed project site. Statements from these interviews are being Q sorted by stakeholders in a subsequent interview, and these Q sorts are being factor analyzed to reveal general perspectives on the technologies and to determine whether a conflict exists among these perspectives. Finally, the information regar ding stakeholder concerns and preferences regarding the proposed remediation technology being developed from narrative analysis of the open -ended interview transcripts, Q methodology, and preference ranking are being used to develop a survey instrument.

--- Page 10 ---
Survey responses are being analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression to determine stakeholders’ concerns and judgments of the acceptability of the proposed remediation technology as well as their willingness to tradeoff benefits and costs to implement the technology. The information regarding stakeholder preferences and concerns is being fed back to guide and inform the three assessment processes (LCA, BCA and risk assessment). Principal Findings and Significance : Of the three assessment exerci ses in this project (social impact assessment; economic impact assessment; environmental risk assessment), the social impact assessment effort needed to be completed first, since it is used to help frame the conduct of the other components. This assessmen t was conducted by interviewing selected stakeholders who are nearby residents, regulatory officials having responsibility for site remediation, experts who have or are conducting studies of the site, and representatives of various interest groups who perc eive that they have a stake in site remediation. The social impact assessment was conducted via two rounds of face -to-face stakeholder interviews conducted in the Picher -Cardin -North Miami area surrounding the Tar Creek site. Careful analysis of the cogni tive maps from the first round of interviews resulted in the construction of an aggregate map which incorporates features of all ten maps. Aggregate maps provide a unique perspective by summarizing the schema of a whole social system into one map. Theref ore they are characteristic of the social system and not attributable to any individual participant. This map serves to inform our understanding of the stakeholders’ perspectives and the preparation of the interviews regarding the wetland treatment system s. The remaining task under the social impact assessment activity is eliciting the stakeholders’ reactions to the new wetlands technology and assessing their health concerns through a knowledge assessment. An influence diagram has been prepared for use as the standard for assessing participant knowledge. The results of social impact assessment have been used to frame the economic and technological effectiveness assessments that are now underway. The economic assessment task has developed an economic valua tion method based on the benefit transfer approach. The model for Tar Creek has been completed but has not yet been populated with data representing treatment wetland performance. This is the remaining task. The risk assessment task was begun by develope d in expert mental model of the Meyer Ranch site at Tar Creek. Influence diagrams were created to represent the movement of contaminants from mine drainage and the possible exposure pathways of those contaminants to humans. In addition, influence diagrams included socioeconomic factors, future sediment removal of wetlands, and future development as probable sources of risk to humans. Three influence diagrams were created. The first one represents the movement of contaminants from mine drainage without impl ementation of an alkaline wetland treatment system. The second represents movement of contaminants through an alkaline wetland treatment system until reaching humans, and the third diagram

--- Page 11 ---
represents the interactions among elements within an alkaline wetla nd system. The arrows symbolize direct pathways of contaminants to different medias (air, soil, and water), and receptors (animals, plants, microorganisms, and humans) which are represented by squares. The oval boxes are some of the transport and exposure mechanisms of contaminants. The three diagrams provided a general overview of the elements affecting the water quality of Mayer Ranch, North Miami, Oklahoma, and therefore, affecting human health. Several experts on different areas, such as toxicology, wet land science, and water quality among others, were identified and interviewed. Dr. Mary Jane Calvey, a toxicologist, wetland specialists: Dr. Robert Nairn and Dr. Aisling O'Sullivan, Dr. Dennis Datin and Mr. David Cates, environmental engineers, and Ms. De nae Athay, an environmental scientist were interviewed. Their input, suggestions, and comments helped improve influence diagrams. All available information from interviews and influence diagrams were collected and reviewed to complete the final expert mental model of Mayer Ranch, North Miami Oklahoma. In addition, influence diagrams representing the existing risk and new risks created by wetland treatment systems were incorporated in the final expert mental model. Without a doubt, the Mayer Ranch sys tem has a high level of complexity, and so does its expert mental model. It is evident that gaps of knowledge exist when trying to explain both transport mechanisms of metals in different media, and the mechanisms of action within wetlands. The resulting expert mental model takes into account exposure pathways of metals until they find their way to humans, but it does not comprise the magnitude of each pathway. Although pathways of metal exposure to humans may always exist regardless of the presence of a wetland treatment system, the difference lies in the degree of exposure. For instance, metal concentration moving from a wetland treatment system to humans may be lower in comparison with metal concentrations getting to humans without passing through wet land treatment systems. In addition, human health risks due to creation of wetlands, future development and socioeconomic factors influence human exposure pathways. This expert mental model tries to incorporate all elements affecting the system in questio n. It also provides an image of the interactions of humans within the Mayer Ranch ecosystem, which become highly important when assessing human health and environmental impacts.

Resistance Tomographic Imaging, Digital Mapping, and Immersion Visualization of Evaporite Karst in Western Oklahoma Basic Information Title:Resistance Tomographic Imaging, Digital Mapping, and Immersion Visualization of Evaporite Karst in Western Oklahoma Project Number: 2002OK4B Start Date:3/1/2001 End Date:2/28/2003 Funding Source: 104B Congressional District:Oklahoma 4th Research Category:Ground-water Flow and Transport Focus Category: Groundwater, Hydrogeochemistry, Methods Descriptors:Resisitivity imaging, digital mapping, visualization, evaporite karst, Oklahoma, contaminant transport, groundwater pollution Principal Investigators:Aondover Tarhule, Thomas Dewers, Rozemarijin Tarhule Publication

Problem and Research Objective Karst aquifers are susceptible to contamin ation because surface waters are introduced directly into the aquifer system through voids, sinkholes, and sinking streams. Once in the system, the contaminants move rapidly through a network of solution conduits that are difficult, expensive and time cons uming to detect using conventional methods such as well sampling or core drilling. Moreover, these discrete sampling methods have a very high probability of missing conduits or contaminant flow paths; the drill core has to be located directly above, or in very close proximity to, the contaminant in order to locate it. Similarly, monitoring wells frequently fail to detect contaminants in kart systems because the flow is concentrated preferentially in the solution conduits. The failure to detect the pathways of contaminant movement may pose a serious health hazard to the people using the aquifer system. At the same time the physical collapse of subsurface voids may undermine surface structures, causing economic damage, insurance claims, litigation, expensive e ngineering remediation works and, in some cases, even loss of lives (Johnson and Quinlan, 1995; Smith, 1997; Johnson, 2001). These considerations, as well as the fact that soluble rocks (gypsum and dolomite) occur within 30 meters below ground surface (m.b .g.s.) in about 10% of the state of Oklahoma, motivated the present study. The goal of the study therefore is to investigate the feasibility of detecting and mapping subsurface karts voids using electrical resistivity tomography and to use a combined G PS/laser range survey technique to evaluate the positional accuracy of detected voids. The advantage of the resistivity method is that it is non -invasive, rapid and inexpensive relative to a conventional well drilling program. The method also generates ver y fine resolution (nearly continuous) resistivity image of the subsurface in two or three dimensions. Study Area and Geologic Setting Three cave systems, Nescatunga, Corn, and Jester; all located in the gypsum deposits of western Oklahoma, were investigat ed (Fig. 1). The geology of the Nescatunga area consists of Permian age soluble gypsum and red shale beds of the Blaine Formation, which is in conformable contact with the underlying Flowerpot Shale and the overlying Dog Creek Shale (Miller et al., 2003; S tanley, 2002). Four gypsum beds, two dolomites and intervening clay shales comprise the Blaine Formation at this site. Medicine Logde, the lower most gypsum layer is overlain by dolomite, followed by the Nescatunga gypsum layer, which contains the cavern system. Red shales overlie the Nescatunga gypsum and then, topping the red shales, another layer of dolomite. Several cavern systems located in the Permian Cloud Chief Formation including Endless Cave, collectively make up the Corn Caves in Wasita County (L ooney and Bozeman, 1984). In the study area the Cloud Chief Formation is approximately 300 feet thick and consists of (oldest to youngest) Weatherford Dolomite, unnamed shale, a gypsum -anhydrate unit and capped with alternating sandstone and shale units. The type locality for the Cloud Chief Formation near Endless/Corn Cave reports the gypsum/anhydrite unit as being 100 feet thick (Fay, 1962). The Cloud Chief Formation is conformable with the underlying Rush Springs Sandstone and the overlying Doxey Shale (Miller et al., 2003).

--- Page 14 ---
2 The third cavern system studied was Jester cave in Greer County. According to Johnson (1987, p.47), Jester cave “developed mainly in a 16 -foot-thick gypsum bed in the lower part of the Van Vacter member of the Blaine Formation. In this area, the Blaine consists of about 150 feet of interbedded gypsum, dolomite, and red bed shale.” The total thickness of the Van Vacter member in the Jester cave area is 80 feet. Six principal gypsum beds, numbered sequentially from 1 through 6, ma ke up the Van Vacter member. A thin dolomite underlies each gypsum layer and, in most places, thin, unnamed shale overlies each of the gypsums. Methodology The single channel Sting R1 -IP-SwiftTM resistivity meter with programmable electrodes was utilize d for this study. Advanced Geosciences Inc. in Austin, Texas, produces the system. The idea is to pass a current of known voltage into the subsurface to be imaged through two current electrodes, and then using a second pair of potential electrodes, measure the potential drop induced by the differential response of earth materials to the penetrating current. The method is effective for detecting voids because air -filled voids show up as anomalously high resistivity regions on the resisitivity field since air has infinite resitivity. On the other hand, water -filled voids show up as anomalously low conductivity spots owing to the high conductivity of water. To carry out a survey, a CREATOR software is first used to program the desired sequence of electrode switching, corresponding to the array type chosen. Four array types, Wenner,Wenner - Schlumberger, dipole -dipole and pole -dipole, were investigated. These array types probe the subsurface in different ways even though they utilize stakes in the same position . For example, the Wenner array takes measurements along several parallel profiles at fixed depths below the ground surface (e.g. 2 m, 4 m, 6 m). In contrast, the dipole -dipole array makes a much larger density of sample measurements, which, in principle, improves the resolution of target features. Survey transects were laid out roughly perpendicular to the orientation of known cave passages and the resisitvity profile of the subsurface recorded automatically according to the array type(s) specified. GPS c oordinates and elevations of selected points along each transect were obtained using a Trimble ProXRS GPS system. The raw data collected is first used to calculate apparent resistivity, which is the weighted average of the resistivity under the four elect rodes. The exact formula used depends on the array type. Owing to inhomogeneities in the subsurface, the apparent resistivity is different from the true resistivity. The modeling software RES2DINVTM (Loke and Barker, 1996) was used to obtain the true resis tivity from which anomalously high (low) features were interpreted against the known resistivity range of common earth materials. Ground truth was achieved using a novel method. Internal cave morphology was first mapped in 3 dimensions using Trimble’s new 4600LS with RTK (real -time kinetic) option, part of a GPS package recently purchased by the University of Oklahoma School of Geology and Geophysics (SG&G). Our particular package permitted real -time cm -scale accuracy in both the horizontal and vertical di mensions. The ProXRS GPS system was mounted on a tripod near an entrance to the cavern system being surveyed, along with the reflectorless laser rangefinder and digital compass (Fig. 2). A DGPS carrier phase location was sited at this initial position. Differential corrections were obtained onsite using the OmniStar system and later via internet resources. A series of control points or stations were then located within the cavern itself spatially referenced to the GPS position by a series of offsets using m ounted reflectors. Beginning at the entrance to the cave, the laser configuration occupied each of these control

--- Page 15 ---
3 stations successively, permitting a survey of the surrounding cavern walls (consisting of locations referenced to the control points) to be con ducted. Although positioning error invariably increases with each successive control point occupied within the cavern, we achieved sub - decimeter accuracy in distance and inclination from each control point, and confirmed the accuracy by reoccupying control stations. Positioning data was then stored and analyzed using GIS (e.g. ESRI ARCVIEW) and CAD. In summary, the steps used in acquiring and utilizing the data are as follows (more details on the procedure may be found in Galen et al (2003): Acquire Carr ier Phase DGPS position outside cave entrance. Survey a series of offset stations from this position into and through the cave using laser positioning (in filter mode) and reflectors. Survey cavern wall morphology at sites of interest from surve yed offset stations with filter mode off. Export positions to CAD or GIS software for visualization. Superimposing the transect of the internal cave passage on a profile of the surface resistivity survey allowed us to determine both the position and elevation of the cave along the surface transect. Finally, the true position of the cave passage is compared to the resistivity signature of the passage to assess positional accuracy. The assessment consisted of measuring the horizontal and vertical depart ure of the resistivity anomaly from the true position of the cave passage. Principal Findings and Significance Internal Cave Mapping We mapped a small portion of Endless Cave in September of 2002. Detailed map of this cave may be found in Looney and Boze man (1984, p.39). In Figure 2, we show the traverse of the resistivity survey, the initial DGPS position outside the cave, the surveyed stations, and the data points collected to record cavern morphology, at two scales and in two and three dimensions. These are included with various sources of geographical information systems (GIS), including digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ’s), a digital raster graph (DRG) of the USGS 7.5’ Corn, Oklahoma Quadrangle, and a ten meter resolution digital elevation model (D EM), and assembled using ESRI’s ARCViewTM software. Figure 3a shows the location of the Endless Cave study site located on Gyp Creek near the boundary between Washita and Custer Counties. A base map of surface topography is produced by draping a 1meter DO Q over the DEM. In Figure 3b, the horizontal locations of the resistivity survey and the cave survey station transect are given by intersecting white lines. A cluster of points at this intersection denote more than 50 locations of cave wall, ceiling, and f loor morphology that are used as ground truth for the surface geophysical imaging of the cavern in this locality. A three -dimensional portrayal of this data set is shown in Figure 3c, with the DOQ drape rendered transparent. This image is oriented as north -looking; north -south running section -

The internal morphology of Nescatunga caves were mapped in July, 2002. In Fig ure 4 we show the two - and three -dimensional GIS of a portion of Nescatunga Cave. Figure 4a shows the location of the Window study site located south of Highway 15 approximately 20 miles east of Woodward in Major Co., Oklahoma. In Figure 3b, the horizontal locations of the resistivity survey and the cave survey station transect are given by intersecting white lines connecting the survey points. A cluster of points at this intersection denote approximately 100 locations of cave wall, ceiling, and floor morph ology that are used as ground truth for the surface geophysical imaging of the cavern.

The view is nearly due east -looking. Jester cave was mapped in June 2003. The data are still being analyzed. In any case the results generated so far demonstrate the feasibility of using the GPS laser range finder to map the internal morphology of caves . There are two downsides to this mapping procedure. First, the equipment is costly although it is rugged and reasonably mud -proof. Second, the method can only be used to map caves large enough to be entered by humans. On the positive side, the method offe rs a fast, accurate, and relatively non -intrusive means to map cave position and morphology. It provides “(under)ground truth” for geophysical methods used for cavern detection. Significance and Contribution of the Internal Cave Mapping One potential ap plication of our results is that m illimeter -to-cm-scale accuracy achieved with this mapping approach could be used to ascertain the degree to which such cavern systems evolve over time scales of decades. The following poster based on the results was pres ented at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America. Galen, M., T. Dewers, and A. Tarhule (2002). Laser positioning and 3 -d mapping of Western Oklahoma karst. Poster Presented at the Annual meeting of the Geological Society of America, Denve r, October 26 -30. Subsequently, the result was elaborated and a the following paper has been accepted for publication in Circular 109 of the Oklahoma Geological Survey Bulletin.Association Miller, Galen, T. Dewers, and A. Tarhule (accepted). Laser Posit ioning and 3 -Dimensional Digital Mapping of Gypsum Karst, Western Oklahoma, USA. Oklahoma Geological Survey. Additional data presently being generated will be incorporated and another paper submitted for publication possibly in Cave and Karst Science or in the Journal of Applied Geophysics. Following the poster presentation at the GSA, we have received inquiries from the USGS office in Florida about how to use the same approach to map the caves in Florida. A second inquiry

5 came from a Petroluem Geochemis t in Ireland who also wanted to know how to use the approach to map their chemical plant. These inquiries testify to the success of our research and the dissemination outreach we have achieved. Resistivity Tomography ERT: Figure 5a shows the resistivity c ross-section near the highway. The plot is based on a dipole -dipole array utilizing 7 m electrode spacing. Electrode 14 was located next to an ODOT drill hole (95 m from start of survey transect, labeled C by the ODOT drill team). The depth to the bottom o f the cave (measured in the drill hole) is 21 m. The cavern is approximately 5 m high by 10 m wide. This information is used to locate the cave on the resistivity profile. The cave coincides in position with an area of anomalously high resistivity (> 22 00 0 Ohm m), providing definitive proof of this anomaly as a void. However, the resistivity anomaly is slightly offset to the right of the true position of the cave. An examination of the measured resistivity data points revealed two missing measurements at t his depth. Missing measurements occur during surveys either due to a faulty electrode or an inability of the Sting to obtain useable data at that measurement point. Hence, interpolation over the missing points could have resulted in a shift of the anomaly. Even so, the result is consistent with other investigators (see www.agiusa.com/stingcave.shtml ) that have also reported marginal positional offsets in the true location of caves detected from resistiv ity profiles. No other resistivity anomalies are detected on this profile. Figure 5b is a plot of the resistivity cross section near the window entrance. The survey utilized a Wenner array with 5 m electrode spacing (equipment failure precluded the use of a dipole -dipole array at this site). The plot revealed two anomalies, one in the center of the plot with resistivity > 24 000 Ohm m and a second to the left of the profile, but at the same depth as the first anomaly, with resistivity > 11 000 Ohm m. From the results of the GPS/laser range mapping, it was established that the centroid of the cave passage is at electrode 14 (65 m) and the depth to the bottom of the cave is 10 -11 m. The cave itself measured 3 m high by 12 m at this point. Superimposing this i nformation on the resistivity profile confirmed that the anomaly in the center of image is the target cave passage. Such excellent agreement suggests strongly that the second anomaly is also most likely a cavern passage. Although not mapped, local cavers w e spoke to mentioned a second cave passage parallel to the main one we surveyed and in the general location of the anomaly identified. These results suggest that ERT is a viable method for detecting subsurface features in the gypsum karst of Oklahoma. Maj or findings from the studies described above can be summarized as follows: The dipole -dipole array produces high -resolution resistivity profiles that are good for imaging cavities. However, the method is prone to “current decay” with a concomitant loss of measurement points. This array type appears to be useful for relatively shallow voids but it is not possible (nor perhaps even desirable) to determine the maximum depth for which dipole -dipole is ideal because of the influence of other factors such as geol ogy and the resistivity contrast between the target feature and the host medium.

--- Page 18 ---
6 2. The Wenner and Wenner -Schlumberger arrays appear to give rather coarse (poorly resolved) resistivity signal of the target voids. For example, void signatures in the resistivi ty profile typically extended over 2 -3 times the actual size of the cavity. As a result, the likelihood of missing a void is high if one were to drill to the target cave or feature based on the image detected with these arrays. Finally, the depth penetrati on of these arrays is also more limited than the other methods used. The pole -dipole array yielded the best results in terms of depth penetration, detection consistency and image resolution. We have, therefore, adopted and recommend this array type for det ecting cavities in the gypsum karst of Western Oklahoma. The downside to this method is that the “infinity” electrode has to be separated from the survey transect by about 5-8 times the length of the survey transect. In closed quarters or small plots this requirement can be a challenge to meet as it increases the number of landowners from whom one has to request permission. Based on the experience and confidence gained from the above studies, we proceeded to map one passage in the Jester Cave system that i s too small to be entered by humans. The data, however, are still being analyzed. We have also carried out a 3 -D resistivity survey of a part of the Nescatunga cave system and the data are still being analyzed. In terms of dissemination, the results of resistivity tomography generated to date have been presented at the Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America: Tarhule, A., T. Halihan, T. Dewers, R. Young, A. Witten (2002). Integrated subsurface imaging techniques for detecting cavities in Ok lahoma evaporite karst. Annual meeting of the Geological Society of America, Denver, October 26 -30. A paper has also been accepted for publication in circular 109 of the Oklahoma Geological Survey Bulletin. Tarhule, Aondover, T. Dewers,R. Young, A. Witte n, T. Halihan (accepted) Integrated Subsurface Imaging Techniques for Detecting Cavities in the Gypsum Karst of Oklahoma. Oklahoma Geological Survey. The results achieved to date are encouraging and have satisfied several cardinal objectives of the study. Even so, it is becoming increasingly clear that some of the original objectives will not be met. These include the following: a. It may not be possible to establish definitively the smallest size of cavity that can be detected with resistivity tomography. Th e reason is that detectability depends is a function of the interactions of several factors, which defer from one site to another. Proposing a numerical value even based on successful empirical findings at one or a few sites may therefore neither justified nor helpful. b. We have also not found suitable site for testing the feasibility of detecting vertically stacked voids.

--- Page 19 ---
7 c. Finally, we have not evaluated the effect of conduit geometry in amplifying or moderating the resistivity signal. In our experience to da te this objective probably is not justified by the resolution achievable with resistivity tomography. Clearly, therefore, the approach has several strengths but some drawbacks. The best possible use of our results therefore is to complement traditional a quifer characterization and monitoring techniques. For example, resistivity tomography would be especially useful and cost effective for determining suitable locations for drilling monitoring wells in karst aquifers. Conclusions This study described an innovative approach for mapping caverns in gypsum karst with resistivity tomography and then using a three -dimensional digital mapping of the caverns to ground truth the anomalies detected. The approach is much more rapid and cost effective than the tradi tional approach of drilling to confirm target features. Insights gained from the study are useful for investigating buried karstic features for which prior ground truth is not feasible. The study demonstrated the feasibility of detecting cave passages with resitivity tomography and identified the most effective array type for the gypsum karst of Western Oklahoma. The results of the 3 -D mapping of internal cave morphologies have begun to attract attention within the cave mapping community as reflected in the requests we have received so far. Analysis of data already collected to map cave passages that are too small for humans, as well as three - dimensional resistivity mapping are continuing.

ii SYNOPSIS Title: Evaluating Cost Effective Technologies to Reduce Phosphorus Loading to Surface Waters for the Ozark Region Investigators: Principal Investigators: Dr. Daniel E. Storm, Professor Dr. Arthur L. Stoecker, Associate Professor Investigators: Tihomir Ancev, Graduate Research Assistant Michael White, Research Engineer Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK Congressional District: Oklahoma, Third. Descriptors: poultry litter, phosphorus, pollution, economics, agriculture, watershed modeling Problem and Research Objectives: Hydrological and nutrient dynamics analysis shows that reduction of exte rnal phosphorus loading to lakes Eucha and Spavinaw in the Ozark region is necessary to mitigate the problem of lake s eutrophication. The sources of external phosphorus loading in the watershed are point sources (municipalities), non-point sources (agric ulture) and background loading (natural). Reduction of external phosphorus loading coul d be achieved at both point sources and non-point sources. The main problem treated in the study was to determine how to achieve the desired phosphorus r eduction in a manner that would be least costly to the society as a whole. The research objectives were: - Estimate phosphorus loading in the Euc ha/Spavinaw watershed using the SWAT model and determine the sources and their relative contributions. - Evaluate cost effective technologies of phosphorus abatement for both point and non-point sources of phosphorus loading. - Determine the level of phosphorus abatem ent that would be socially least expensive. - Determine the most cost effective poultr y litter and land management practices on a site-specific basis using high-level spatial detail. Methodology: The Lake Eucha/Spavinaw Basin was modeled using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to evaluate the non-point source nutrient loading to the lakes and its origins. State-of-t he-art Geographic Information S ystem (GIS) and weather data were used in the model. Land cover data were developed from satellite imagery and ground truth data. In addition, high detail daily rainfall estimates were derived from Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) data and incorporated in the model.

--- Page 30 ---
iiiNutrient loads for the basin were estima ted using the US Geologic Survey (USGS) program LOADEST2 using observed water qua lity measurements and stream flow data provided by the City of Tuls a (COT) and the USGS. The hydrologic portion of the model was calibrated using three US GS stream flow stations, and the phosphorus portion was calibrated using data from eight COT water quality stations. The economic modeling was based on minimi zing total abatement and environmental damage costs related to phosphorus loading in the Eucha/Spavinaw Basin. Abatement costs were estimated at the point source ( City of Decatur, Arkansas) as the costs of chemical treatment to pr ecipitate phosphorus in the municipal wastewater. The estimation was conducted by enumerating engineer ing cost data. Abat ement costs were also estimated for the non-point (agricultu ral) sources of phosphorus pollution in the basin, as a reduction of net agricultural inco me under the alternative poultry litter and land management practices. The estimation wa s conducted using agricultural statistics data and agricultural enterpris e budgets. The total and marg inal phosphorus abatement costs were derived within a linear pr ogramming optimization framework. Environmental damage costs treat ed in the study were the co st of additional drinking water treatment at the City of Tulsa and cost of recreational values of the area lakes. Other environmental damages were not cons idered because of t he lack of data and technical limitations. The costs of additional water treatment for t he City of Tulsa were estimated by regression analysis using cost and phosphorus loading data. The costs of lost recreational values for the area lakes we re estimated using the travel cost method. The demand for recreation was estimated as a function of phosphorus loading in the watershed using maximum likelihood method. Co st of lost recreational values was approximated by the change in consumer su rplus under various phosphorus loading levels. Total and marginal environmental damage costs were estimated as a function of phosphorus loading using regression analysis. The level of phosphorus abatement that is least costly to the society as a whole was determined by equating the marginal abatement and damage costs. At this determined level of abatement, optimal poultry litter and land management practices were assigned to each distinct agricultural land area in t he watershed. Optimal level of abatement was also assigned to the point source. Principal Findings and Significance: The calibrated SWAT model estimated the average annual total phosphorus loading to Lake Eucha to be 49,400 kg/yr, which includes 11,400 kg/yr from the Cit y of Decatur point source for the period 8-1-1998 to 3- 15-2002, and about 38,000 kg/year fr om the non-point sources. The principal findings are: - Optimal levels of phosphorus loading under the various policies and technologies analyzed suggest that a reasonable economic target for phosphorus loading from the point and non-point sources could be set in a range of 23,000 to 26,000 kg/ year. It is difficult to se t an exact optimal level of phosphorus loading in the watershed because of inherent uncertainti es with both SWAT and the economic modeling. - The use of uniform restriction policie s alone (represented by the Soil Test Phosphorus criterion) to regulate litter application and phosphorus loading in the

--- Page 31 ---
ivwatershed is not an efficient policy. A more efficient outcome is likely if site- specific (i.e. field level) criterion is used. - Changing the land use patterns and existi ng land management practices is an effective and efficient way to achieve phosphorus-loading reduction. In particular, changing the existing management practices (stocking rates and fertilization) on the overgrazed pastureland is very important for phosphorus reduction. A significant portion of the row crop (40%) was also found optima lly converted to other land use (hay) with less potential for phosphorus runoff. - Litter management technologies, such as treating poultry litter with alum, were found to efficiently reduce phosphorus loading. - Transportation of poultry litter within and outside the watershed was found to be an important part of the optimal soluti on for reduction of phosphorus loading. - Abatement of the point sour ce is required to achiev e least cost reduction of external phosphorus loading in the watershed. - Results are presented at a high level of spatial detail enabling the use of site- specific policies and targeting to achi eve the most effective and efficient reduction of phosphorus loading in the watershed.

1PART I SWAT MODEL SETUP

--- Page 43 ---
2INTRODUCTION Lakes Eucha and Spavinaw water quality is being de graded from excess algal growth. This excess growth is the result of an overabundance of nut rients in the lake, assumed to be primarily phosphorus. Phosphorus loads originate from either point sources, such as the City of Decaturmunicipal waste water treatment plant, or from nonpoint sources like pastures. The majority of the phosphorus loading has been attributed to nonpoi nt sources (Wagner and Woodruff, 1997; Storm et al., 2001). Fields in the Lake Eucha ba sin have received phosphorus from poultry litter application for many years. Poultry litter is often applied to meet the crop’s nitrogen requirements.When phosphorus in excess of what the crop can use is applied, phosphorus builds up in the soil.Runoff extracts soluble phosphorus from the soil and litter, and carries sediments containing phosphorus to the lakes. The SWAT (Soil and Wa ter Assessment Tool) model was used to predict how external loads are affected by management changes.

--- Page 44 ---
3SWAT INPUT DATA GIS data for topography, soils, land cover, and streams were used in the SWAT model. These data used were the most current at the time of compilation. Observed daily rainfall and temperature datawere used in all modeling. An ArcView GIS interface is available to generate model inputs from commonly available GIS data. These GIS data are summarized by the interface and c onverted to a form usable by the model. GIS data layers of elevation, soils, and land use ar e used to generate th e input files. Observed temperature and precipitation can be incorporated. If no observed weather data are available,weather can be stochastically simulated. Topography Topography was defined by a Digital Elevation M odel (DEM). DEMs for the United States are available for downloading via the Internet. The DEM was used to calculate subbasin parameters such as slope, slope length, and to define the st ream network. The resulting stream network was used to define the layout and number of subbasins. Charact eristics of the stream network, such as channel slope, length, and width, were all derived from the DEM. Individual 1:24,000 thirty meter DEMs were stitched together to construct a DEM for the entire basin. When tiled, 1:24,000 DEMs often have missing data at the seams. These missing data mustbe replaced. A 3x3 convolution filter was applie d to the DEM to produce a seamless filtered DEM. Any missing data at the seams of the original DE M were replaced with data from the filtered DEM. The resulting seamless DEM retains as much non-filtered data as possible (Figure 1.1). Filtering

--- Page 45 ---
4 tends to remove both peaks and valleys from a DE M thereby reducing the perceived slope. For this reason the use of filtered data were kept to a minimum. Figure 1.1 Seamless Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the Lake Eucha/Spavinaw Basin constructed from U.S. Geographic Survey 1:24,000 DEMs. Soils Soil GIS data are required by SWAT to define soil characteristics. SWAT uses STATSGO (State Soil Geographic Database) data to define soil attributes for any given soil. The GIS datamust contain the S5ID (Soils5id number for US DA soil series), or STMUID (State STATSGO polygon number) to link an area to the STATSGO database. The soils layer was derived from two separate GIS coverages (Figure 1.2). The Oklahoma portion is 200-meter resolution MIADS (Map Information Assembly and Display System) data

--- Page 46 ---
5 from the Oklahoma Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). The Arkansas portion is a 1:20,000 order II soil survey digitized by the University of Arkansas. Figure 1.2 Soil distribution in the Lake Eucha/Spavinaw basin. Land Cover Land cover is perhaps the most important GIS data used in the model. The land cover theme affects the amount and distribution of pasture, row crop, and forest in the basin. These land covers areradically different. Forested areas contribute little to the nutrient loading, while pastures and rowcrops are thought to be the primar y source of nutrients entering the lakes. Row crop in this basin is assumed to be green beans followed by winter wh eat, based on the observations of Delaware County Cooperative Extension agent Jason Hallenbeck. It is important that land cover data be based on the most current data available, since land cover changes over time. Land cover was derived from 30 meter Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery, digital aerial photos, and 45 ground truth data points provided by Oklahoma State University (OSU) (1.4).

--- Page 47 ---
6 Imagery for June 12, 2001 was obtained and classi fied by Applied Analysis Inc. (AAI). An unsupervised iterative self-organizing data anal ysis (ISODATA) clustering algorithm was applied by AAI to define spectral categories. After se veral iterations these categories combined into individual land covers. The report of the AAI classification is located in Appendix 1.1.

7 Figure 1.4 Ground truth locations and selected images provided to Applied Analysis Incorporated by Oklahoma State University. Starting upper right and progressing clockwise, the land covers depicted are range, row crop, well managed pasture, and hay. Weather SWAT can use observed weather data or simulate it using a database of weather statistics from stations across the United States. Observed daily precipitation and minimum and maximumtemperature were used in the Lake Eucha/Spavinaw model. A combination of Next GenerationWeather Radar (NEXRAD) radar derived precipitation and Cooperative Observation networkgage data were used in the SWAT model for the Lake Eucha/Spavinaw basin.

--- Page 49 ---
8Radar Derived Rainfall NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radar 88D (WSR-88D) derived precipitation estimates were incorporated into the SWAT model. WSR-88D Precipitation data were gage biased and archivedby the Arkansas-Red Basin River Forecast Center (ABRFC). These data have a resolution of 4 km and are available from the ABRFC website in Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)format. These data are available in 1 hour, 6 hour, and 24 hour increments. SWAT requires dailyrainfall, however the 24 hour increment data from the ABRFC runs from 6 am to 6 am CentralStandard Time (CST). Daily data (12 am -12 am CST) were summarized from the 6 hourincrement data for use in SWAT. Daylight-saving time was ignored to simplify thesecalculations. A significant amount of conversion is required to use the NEXRAD weather data in SWAT. NetCDF format is most commonly used on a UNIX platform and thus PC compatible tools are scarce. A PC compatible text translator ncdumps.exe was written by the NOAAs Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. This translator wa s called from a batch file to convert 6 hour increment NetCDF files to American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) text. A set of custom programs written in Microsoft Visual Basic were used to used to view andextract data covering the basin. Figure 1.5 cont ains a graphical representation of one 6 hour NEXRAD cumulative precipitation grid. The 1994 to 2002 precipitation estimates used inSWAT were derived from over 10,000 such grids.

--- Page 50 ---
9Cooperative Observation Network National Weather Service COOP (Cooperative Observ ing Network) station data from 27 stations from 1/1/1950 to 3/31/02 were used to suppl ement the NEXRAD weather data (Figure 1.6). COOP data are available from the NOAA (Nati onal Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). COOP data are seldom continuous for long periods of time. Missing days and even months are common. The period of record at stations are inconsistent, so the number of active stationschanges with time. When SWAT detects missing data at a station, it generates simulatedweather. Therefore, gaps in a station’s record were filled using interpolated data fromsurrounding stations. Due to the inclusion of NEXRAD data, temper ature and precipitation processing methods were different. Temperature was only interpolated to patch the period of record at existing stations. Because SWAT requires a fixed network of weathe r stations, precipitation data were interpolated to the same grid as NEXRAD data (Figure 1.7). This grid interpolated precipitation data wereprepared for the period 1/1/1950 to 3/31/02. These interpolated data were used exclusivelybefore 1994 and used to patch holes in the subsequent NEXRAD data. Because of the largeamount of data associated with these weather files, all processing and formatting was done usingcustom programs written in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) and Microsoft Excel.

11 Figure 1.7 Four kilometer resolution Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) grid cell centers used to define weather stations in the SWAT model for the Lake Eucha/Spavinaw Basin. Subbasin Delineation The subbasin layout was defined by SWAT using the DEM, a stream burn-in theme, and a table of additional outlets. The stream burn-in theme consists of digitized streams. Its purpose is to helpSWAT define stream locations correctly in fl at topography. A modified reach3 file from the US Environmental Protections Agency’s BASINS (B etter Assessment Science Integrating Point and Non-point Sources) model was used. The theme was modified to remove the outline of both lakes, which the model confused with a stream path. Model predictions are only available at subbasinoutlets, so additional outlets were added at points of interest such as gage stations, water quality stations, or lake boundaries. A stream threshol d value of 1000 ha was used to delineate subbasins. Threshold area is the minimum contributing upland area required to define a single stream. Theresult is 68 subbasins (Figure 1.8). Fewer subbasi ns would simplify the modeling process, but this level of detail was needed to adequately represent the basin.

--- Page 53 ---
12 HRU Distribution Each of the 68 subbasins was split into HRUs (Hydraulic Response Units) by SWAT. The land use [%] over subbasin area threshold was changed from the default 20% to 1%. This threshold determines the minimum percentage of any land cover in a subbasin that will become an HRU. The soil class [%] over subbasin area was also reduced from its default value of 20% to 10%. By reducing these thresholds, the number of HRUs was increased to 1052. Figure 1.8 The Lake Eucha/Spavinaw basin divided into 68 subbasins. This configuration was used in all SWAT model predictions unless otherwise noted.

--- Page 54 ---
13HRU Slope One weakness of the SWAT 2000 Arcview Interface is that slope is considered uniform for all HRUs in a given subbasin. Forest and pasture HRUs are modeled using the same slope, when in reality they may be radically different. To elimin ate this weakness, slopes were estimated from the DEM for each land cover in each subbasin manually. We derived slope for row crop/small grains only from fields larger than 10 acres, because it is unlikely that anyone would cultivate an area any smaller. These smaller areas are likely missclassifi cations in the land cover data. Forested areasin the basin had an averaged slope of 14.7 % while pasture (Figure 1.9) and row crop averaged 5.2 and 5%, respectively. Ponds Ponds affect the hydrology by impounding water and tr apping nutrients. Water in ponds is subject to evaporation and seepag e into the shallow aquifer. Nutrients and sediment settle out and are trapped. Test runs using the SWAT model indicate ponds significantly reduced nutrient andsediment concentrations. Because of the difficulty associated with c ounting ponds in each subbasin, ponds were assumed uniformly distributed in agricultural portions of th e basin. Heavily forested areas were assumed to have no ponds (Figure 1.10). All ponds in a single Beaty Creek subbasin were counted andsummarized. These ponds were defined from 1: 24,000 USGS DRG (Digital Raster Graphic). This level of detail was required to define the majority of ponds. These estimates were applied to allsubbasins considered to have ponds. Other subbasins with similar land cover appeared visuallysimilar, indicating that ponds are somewhat uniformly distributed throughout pasture areas in thebasin. Of the total area in each subbasin, 20% wa s routed through ponds. Total surface area of all ponds in a subbasin was estimated as 0.32% of the total area of that subbasin. Each pond was

--- Page 56 ---
15 Figure 1.10 Subbasins in the Lake Eucha/Spavinaw basin assumed to have a significant number of ponds. Management SWAT defines management as a series of indivi dual operations. The timing of these operations may be defined by a date, or as a fraction of the tota l heat units required by the crop. Each land cover is assigned a set of management operations. Following is a list of land covers and their relativecoverage of the watershed as depicted in the SWAT Model: • Forest 51.3% • Hayed Pastures 13.3%• Well Managed Pastures 23.1%• Over-grazed or Poorly Managed Pastures 6.5%• Brushy Rangeland 0.1%• Urban 1.3%• Water 1.7%• Row Crop 2.6%

--- Page 57 ---
16Heat Units Heat unit scheduling is the default. Heat units are accumulated when the average daily temperature exceeds the base temperature of the crop. The base temperature is the minimum temperaturerequired by the plant to grow. The amount of h eat units accumulated each day is equal to the average daily temperature minus the base temperatur e of the plant. When no plants are growing the model uses a base temperature of 0 o C and keeps a separate running total. This base 0oC running total is used to schedule planting dates because no heat units can be accumulated until plant growth begins. Litter Litter application rate was varied by land cover w ithin each subbasin. Hay pasture received the base litter application rate. Poorly managed pastures received 70% of the base rate, while well managed pastures receive 130% of the base rate. Row crop received litter to supplement commercial fertilizer nitrogen application rates to recommended levels. Pasture management is not uniform across the ba sin. The amount of litter applied in each subbasin is different. The SWAT interface was not used to generate these management files (.mgt), because that required each file to be manually modified. Th ere is one management file for each of the 1052 HRUs. With multiple management changes, the task would be daunting. Therefore, a program waswritten to create files identical in format to those generated by the ArcView SWAT interface. Cattle Stocking Rate To verify the stocking rate used for pastures in th SWAT model, we estimated the actual number of cattle in the basin. County level National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) cattle estimates

--- Page 58 ---
17for the period 1998-2001 were combine with land cove r data to estimate the number of cattle within the basin. We assumed that cattle are evenly distri buted across all pastures in Delaware and Benton counties. From these data we estimate the number of cattle and calves in the basin to be 39,000 head. The SWAT model does not simulate individual cattle . Instead a daily biomass removal and manure application are used to represent the presence of a grazing cow. The amount a cow will consumedepends on the type and growth stage of the cow in question. Because there are many different types of cattle in the basin, we use the animal unit con cept. Stocking rates are often expressed as animal units. One animal unit could be expressed as a co w and calf pair or two-400 lb stockers; both would consume a similar amount of grass. The total num ber of animal units simulated on pastures in the model is 24,500. Wheat is not included in this es timate because it is winter and spring grazing only, and thus this is a conservative estimate. Since th e NASS derived estimate is the number of cattle and calves, these estimates are not directly comparable without assuming a specific type of animal(Table 1.1). The assumption of a 600 lb stocker cattle yields 35,000 head used in the SWAT model and a 10% error in the number of cattle simulated in the basin. Row Crop Row crop areas were managed as a winter wheat/g reen bean rotation. Grazing is suspended when dry biomass falls below 600 kg/ha (approximately 5 inch standing forage; OSU ExtensionPublication F-2586). Below are the row crop operations and dates used in the SWAT model.Operation Date Grazing ½ Animal Unit/Acre 2/15 Litter Application 3/1Harvest/Kill Wheat 5/1Spring Plowing 5/4Plant Green Bean 5/15Harvest/Kill Green Bean 8/1

Any time there is less than 1600 kg for well managed pastures and 600 kg/ha for poorly managed or over grazedpastures (dry weight) of biomass per hectare grazing is suspended. Forest Only minor modifications to the default management for forested areas were made. Ideal forest management would have contained no harvest ope ration. However, this operation was required to increase temporal stability. Operation Heat Units Plant 0 Harvest 1.2 Hayed Pastures A cool season grass was selected as the cover for hay pastures in the model. No grazing was simulated on hay pastures.

21 Soil Phosphorus Content Two distinctly different methods were used to estimate soil phosphorus content. Pasture and row crop soil phosphorus content were estimated using obser ved soil test data STP for forested area was not used directly in the SWAT model, but instead was used as a calibration parameter. Pasture - Soil Phosphorus Content Observed soil test data were used to estimate th e soil phosphorus content for pasture portions of each subbasin. Pasture soil samples collected by the Oklahoma Conservation Commission in 1998 andanalyzed by the Oklahoma State University (OSU) Soil, Water & Forage Analytical Laboratorywere used for the Oklahoma portion of the waters hed, which resulted in an average STP of 170 lb P/acre. Soil samples for the Arkansas portion of the basin were provided by the Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission. These data were collected by the Benton County Conservation District during 1994 through 1997 and analyzed by the University of Arkansas Soil and WaterLaboratory. A mean of 334 lb P/acre was derived from 261 pasture soil samples of Benton County. Soil test phosphorus (STP) data for Oklahoma and Arka nsas were analyzed in different labs using slightly different methods. Oklahoma soil samples were analyzed by the Oklahoma State University(OSU) Soil, Water & Forage Analytical Laboratory and Arkansas soil samples were analyzed by the University of Arkansas (UA) Soil Testing a nd Research Laboratory. OSU and UA use extraction ratios of 1:10 and 1:7, respectively, and use diffe rent instrumentation for analysis. OSU uses a colorimetric method and UA uses inductively coupled argon plasma spectrometry (ICAP). Dr.Nathan Slaton with the UA provided the followi ng relationship for different extraction ratios (n .500):

22 where Mehlich III is in mg/l. Dr. Hailin Zha ng with OSU provided the following relationship between ICAP and the colorimetric method (n=3577 R2=0.98): where Mehlich III is in mg/l. The average pasture STP level used for the Arkansas portion of the Lake Eucha basin was 334 lbs/ac. Based on these regression equations, an Arkansas STP of 334lbs/ac corresponds to an OSU value of 372 lbs/ac. Soil samples from the Oklahoma Conservation Commission were double checked to ensure that their locations were within the indicated subbasin. Some 14 samples fell outside the Lake Eucha basinor were unusable for other reasons. Samples less th an 400 meters outside the basin were reassigned to the nearest subbasin. An area weighted soil test phosphorus was calculated for each of SWAT`s 58 subbasins (Figure 1.11). Row Crop - Soil Phosphorus Content County level soil test data for row crop/small grai ns fields were obtaine d for Benton and Delaware counties and incorporated into the SWAT model. Data for Benton county were taken from theUniversity of Arkansas Soil Testing and Research Laboratory website(http://www.uark.edu/depts/soiltest/). County and crop codes required to utilize these data wereobtained from Nathan Slayton (Dir ector of Soil Testing, University of Arkansas Soil Testing and Research Laboratory). These data were corrected for differences in labor atory methods, yielding a Mehlich III STP value of 212 lb/acre for Benton c ounty row crop/small grains. Data for Delaware county were compiled by the Oklahoma State Soil, Water & Forage Analytical Laboratory at our

25Poultry Litter Application Rate The number of poultry houses and the pasture area in each subbasin were used to determine poultry litter application rates. All litter produced in a subbasin was assumed to be uniformly applied to pastures in that subbasin. Simmons Foods Inc. provided locations of seve ral company farms which export poultry litter from the basin. The initial litter application rate was re duced in these areas to account for the exported litter. A total of 5883 ton/yr was exported. Other integrators also export litter but the locations of their houses were not available, and thus we were unable to remove the litter from the propersubbasins. It should be noted, however, that Simmons Foods Inc. represented a significant portion of the exported poultry litter in the basin. Broiler, layer, and turkey production all contribute to the total litter production. Each type of operation produces a different amount of litter, and litter of a different composition (Table 1.4). The amount of litter contributed basin-wide by each t ype of operation is summarized in Table 1.5. The average litter composition was determined by using the relative amount of each litter applied in the basin and it’s composition (Table 1.6). The average amount of poultry litter applied to past ures was 1830 kg/ha (0.81 t on/acre). This is the total amount of litter produced in the basin divided by the total area of pasture and row crop.Because many pastures receive little or no poultry litter the average application rate would besomewhat higher. The maximum poultry litter rate was assigned to subbasin 52, 9310 kg/ha (4.1ton/acre), which reflects the high number of poultry operations located in the small subbasin (Figure 12). A total of 91,700 tons of poultry litter was es timated to be applied in the Eucha/Spavinaw

Ground water contributions to stream flow are known as baseflow. The SWAT model was calibrate d separately against observed surface and baseflow. Baseflow was separa ted from the total observed stream flow using the USGS HYSEP sliding interval method. Basefl ow fractions were relatively high throughout the basin, likely the result of the kars t topography(Table 1.8). Karst features allow significant interaction between stream flow and ground water (Wagner and Woodruff 1997). Table 1.8 Observed average flow and baseflow fractions as determined by the HYSEP sliding interval method. Observed Loading Development Water quality data were available for 10 suitable locations in the basin. Soluble and total phosphorus and nitrate loads were estimated at each of these stations (Figure 1.14). SWAT wascalibrated for nutrients after the hydrologic calibration was completed. Flow Estimation Flow was estimated at each water quality station where flow data were unavailable. Initially, daily flow was estimated from the closest stream ga ge and assumed flow was proportional to drainage area. Flow data before 8/1998 were estimated from the Spavinaw station only, because Spavinaw

--- Page 71 ---
30 was the only active station before 8/1998. To further refine the estimate, the flow at each station was separated into surface and baseflow fractions. The ra tio of daily precipitation for the area above each water quality station and the area above each gage was used to bias surface runoff estimates.Baseflow fractions were not corrected. Surface runoff adjustments were limited to a maximum of three times and a minimum of 1/3 the original value. Figure 1.14 City of Tulsa and US Geographic Survey water quality station locations.

31Nutrient Loading Nutrient loads were estimated by station us ing the USGS DOS program LOADEST2 (Crawford, 1996). This program was developed by Charles Crawford (USGS Supervisory Hydrologist) to estimate loading using the rating curve method. The software has 10 models from which to choose,with models 1-8 are listed below: moodel 1: ln(load) = b0 + b1 ln(flow) model 2: ln(load) = b0 + b1 ln(flow) + b2 ln(flow)**2model 3: ln(load) = b0 + b1 ln(flow) + b2 dectimemodel 4: ln(load) = b0 + b1 ln(flow) + b2 sin(dectime) + b3 cos(dectime)model 5: ln(load) = b0 + b1 ln(flow) + b2 ln(flow)**2 + b3 dectimemodel 6: ln(load) = b0 + b1 ln(flow) + b2 ln(flow)**2 + b3 sin(dectime) + b4 cos(dectime)model 7: ln(load) = b0 + b1 ln(flow) + b2 sin(dectime) + b3 cos(dectime) + b4 dectimemodel 8: ln(load) = b0 + b1 ln(flow) + b2 ln (flow)**2 + b3 sin(dectime) + b4 cos(dectime + b5 dectime Dectime is time in fractional years. Each of these 8 models was used by LOADEST2 at each station. At each station 2 to 3 models were selected based on the estimated residual variance calculated by LOADEST2. These 2 to 3 modelswere then graphed as observed vs predicted con centrations. Visual comparisons of each graph and the estimated residual variance for each model were used to select the best model at each station(Table 1.9).

34CALIBRATION The SWAT model was calibrated using observed stream and nutrient data. Three stream gage stations and eight water quality stations were us ed in the calibration. The model was calibrated for total flow, surface flow, baseflow, soluble phosphorus, and total phosphorus. The model was first calibrated on stream flow at each of the three gages. Observed stream flow was split into surface runoff and baseflow. After the hydrologic calibration the model was calibrated for nutrients. SWAT model predicted loads were comp ared to loads estimated from samples taken at eight water quality stations, and relative error was calculated at each station. The relative error in load at each station was weighted by the area upstream each station and the number of high flow samples at that station were used to develop a si ngle basin wide relative error. This average relative error was used to guide the nutrient calibration. The sum of the absolute relative error at all stations was also calculated and used as a secondary guide during the calibration. Relative Error (%) = (Predicted- Observed)/Observed * 100 % Hydrologic Calibration Three gage stations, shown in Figure 1.15, were used in the calibration of total flow, surface runoff, and base flow. All available streamflow for the calibration period (8/1/1998 to 3/15/2002) were utilized. The period of available data from the three stations is not the same. Spavinaw Creek havedata prior to 8/98 but it was not included in the calibration to allow a single calibration period for all stations.

--- Page 76 ---
35We split the basin into three areas, each with a di fferent set of calibration parameters. Subbasins not upstream of a gage were lumped with the most similar adjacent calibrated area. Land use,topography, geology, and location were used to dete rmine subjectively how to lump each subbasin. Relative error was used to compare observed and pr edicted data and to guide the calibration process. Modifications to model parameters were required to calibrate the model and are given in Table 1.11. Parameters governing ground water were modified to compensate for the karst topography of theregion. Results of the calibration are shown in Ta ble 1.12. Note relative error was less than 5% for the Spavinaw and Beaty Creek gages. Blackhollow was calibrated by visual comparison betweenobserved and predicted flows, and thus the average annual relative error is not a good measure ofthe quality of the calibration at this station. The visual calibration was required due to long dryperiods with no flow observed at the gage . Figures 1.16 and 1.17 detail the results of the calibration at the Spavinaw Creek Gage.

Nutrient Calibration The nutrient calibration was performed in a di fferent manner than the hydrologic calibration, because many nutrient parameters are not specific to land covers or subbasins. A slightly different period was also used to calibrate the nutrient portion of the model, i.e.1-1-98 to 3-15-2002. The hydrologic calibration did not begin until 8-1-98. The basin was calibrated as a whole usingcomparisons at all stations simultaneously.

Phosphorus Observed and predicted loads at 8 of the 10 stations were compared. The remaining two stations had little high flow sampling and were considered t oo uncertain for use in the calibration. Relative error was calculated at each station for soluble a nd total phosphorus. These relative errors were area weighted according to the contributing area at each water quality station and the number of high flow samples; the result was used to guide the calibration. The result of the nutrient calibration is shown in Table 1.14. Some observed loads are calculated from samples taken downstream the City of Decatur point source. To quantify nonpoint source loading from the observed data, we remove the loading from City of Decatur point source by assuming the load was 90% soluble and simply subtracted it from

--- Page 81 ---
40all stations downstream. In reality much of this soluble phosphorus would be assimilated into the biota and only be measurable via total phosphorus. We do not have data to directly estimate how much of the point source load would be soluble when it reaches each of the downstream stations,and therefore our assumption was conservative. Relative error at any given station may be off by a substantial amount. Because the majority of the parameters are not distributed, it is not possible to make an adjustment at one station without affecting all other stations. In addition, many st ations do not have suffici ent high flow sampling to accurately estimate loadings and thus little relative weight was given to these stations in thecalibration process. The following parameters were adjusted basin wide in the basin input file(Basins.bsn): NPERCO (Nitrogen Percolation Coefficient) = 2 PPERCO (Phosphorus Percolation Coefficient) = 3PHOSKD (Phosphorus Soil Partitioning Coefficient) = 800PSP (Phosphorus Sorption Coefficient)= 0.42 Additional parameters such as Biological Mixing Efficiency (BIOMIX) a nd Minimum Biomass for Grazing were also modified by land cover. These values are listed in Table 1.15. STP was used to calibrate the nutrients from fore sted areas. Modifications to basin wide phosphorus parameters were required to calibrate the model form its response to surface application of poultry litter. These modifications required an increase in la bile P in forested areas to 40 mg/kg to maintain satisfactory total P loading from heavily forested areas like Blackhollow.

42MODEL LIMITATIONS There are several limitations that should be noted. Li mitations may be the resu lt of data used in the model, inadequacies in the model, or using the model to simulate situations for which it was notdesigned. Hydrologic models will always have lim itations, because the science behind the model is not perfect nor complete, and a model by defi nition is a simplification of the real world. Understanding the limitations helps assure that accurate inferences are drawn from modelpredictions. Weather is the driving force for any hydrologic mode l and thus uncertainty in the rainfall or the rainfall distribution across the watershed is importa nt. Great care was, therefore, taken to include as much accurate, observed weather data as possi ble. The inclusion of NEXRAD derived weather data should in theory, improve the accuracy of the model and reduce this limitation. However this was not evaluated in this study. Rainfall is estimat ed on a 4 km grid. Rainfall can be quite variable even within a single grid cell, especially in the spring and summer when convective thunderstorms produce precipitation with a high degree of spatial va riability. It may rain heavily at one location, but be dry a short distance away. On an average annual or average monthly basis, these errors have less influence since they are typically not additive. This limitation, among others, cautions us againstusing model output on a daily basis. The SWAT model assumes total phosphorus includes lab ile, active, and stable forms in a fixed ratio. Phosphorus loading from pasture originates primarily from lab ile forms of soil phosphorus due to low erosion. Phosphorus loading from row crops, wh ere erosion is high, contains all forms of soil phosphorus including labile, active and stable forms. The SWAT model calculates stable mineral

--- Page 84 ---
43phosphorus based on active and labile phosphorus. We assume that Mehlich III soil test is equal to the sum of the labile and active mineral forms, wh ich is model input. The ratio of active to stable forms at equilibrium is set via a single basin-wi de model input in SWAT. The equilibrium ratio of active and stable forms is fixed in SWAT, although both ratios probably vary with soil type. Thisassumption governs the relative loading from pastur e and row crop. Therefor e, if active and stable phosphorus forms are over estimated the relative contribution of phosphorus from row crop will beover predicted. Scenarios involving radical departures from calibration conditions result in greater uncertainty. Although calibration assures the user that the results reflect the range of conditions encountered at the watershed, they do not assure the model will be accurate for drastic changes in land use ormanagement. Only a single point source was included in th is analysis, although there are many other minor sources in the basin. These other sources, such as CAFOs, septic tanks and small communities, were considered negligible. There is uncertainty associated with specifying uniform management for a land cover category. It is not practical to specify management for every field in the basin, and thus a typical management was selected and applied basin-wide for each la nd cover type. Management operations include grazing, fertilization, tillage, planting, and harvesting. An important limitation is that SWAT simulate s poultry litter applications as simple nutrient additions applied uniformly to the top 10 mm of th e soil surface. In reality poultry litter lies on the

--- Page 85 ---
44soil surface until rainfall moves it into the soil. In the first few rain fall events after application the litter may interact more closely with surface runo ff than simulated by SWAT. In the field we would expect high phosphorus concentrations in surface r unoff when rainfall occurs immediately following litter application, but lower concentrations later in the season. In the SWAT model, high short termphosphorus concentrations may not be simulated, but through calibration accuracy is achieved formonthly and annual phosphorus loads. This limitation makes it inadvisable to use daily simulationresults.

45 PART II ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

--- Page 87 ---
46INTRODUCTION Several hydro-biological studies have f ound that external phosphorus loading to the Lake Eucha is the main contributor towards eutrophication of both lakes Eucha and Spavinaw, and recommended reduction of ex ternal phosphorus loading as the most effective remediation (Storm et al. (2002), OWRB (2001), OCC (1997)). There is a wide array of regulations, policies and practices that could be instituted to achieve the goal of reduced external phosphorus loading to the lakes. However, there is an efficient subset of them that will achieve the desired reduction of external phosphorus loading at least cost to the society. Economic analysis in this st udy attempts to determine that subset of economically efficient regulations, policies and practices. Overview of the Economic Activity in the Region The Eucha-Spavinaw watershed is predominantly located in portions of two counties, Benton County, Arkansas and Dela ware County, Oklahoma. A summary of the economic activities in those two counties is pr ovided to serve as an introduction to the economic analysis of the watershed. Economic Changes in the Region from 1980-2000 The twenty-year period from 1980 to 2000 witnessed considerable economic growth in the Benton Co., Arkansas and Delawa re Co., Oklahoma. Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in Figure 2.1. show that total population grew at 3.3 percent annually and nearly doubled from 102,000 in 1980 to 192,000 by the year 2000. Total real personal income had a sustained annual gr owth rate of 5.6 percent and tripled from

--- Page 88 ---
47$1.5 billion to $4.6 billion by 2000. Income per capita in 1999-2001 dollars grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent and increased from $14,000 to nearly $24,000 dollars by the year 2000. Figure 2.1. Population and Income Growth in the Benton County, Arkansas and Delaware County, Oklahoma Area. Sources of Economic Growth from 1980 to 2000 The manufacturing and retail trade sector s experienced the largest increase in employment and wage payments. Much of th e increase in the manufacturing sector was in food and kindred products because of th e increase in feed manufacturing and poultry processing. Big portion of the increase in the retail sector could be attributed to the growth in the Wal-Mart chain. Figure 2.2. s hows the wage earnings of workers and proprietors which have been aggregated into five sectors for the two-county economy.

Wage and Proprietors Earnings by Sector in Benton and Delaware Counties in 1999-2001 Dollars. It can be noted from Figure 2.2 that the largest increase in earnings was in the trade (wholesale and retail) and trans portation sectors for the period 1990-2000. The finance and services sectors also experienced a corresponding growth during the last decade. Major growth in the agricultural services and food and kindred products sector during the first decade was related to grow th in poultry production in the two-county area. Growth in the construction sector is a reflection of and dependent upon the growth in other sectors. Table 2.1. describes the sector-by-sector gr owth in more detail. All sectors except the mining sector experienced positive economic growth over the past two decades. The fastest growing sectors were the retail tr ade, finance-realestate-insurance, and transportation sectors, which averaged more than seven percent growth per year from 1980 to 2000. The services, agricultural servi ces, and food and kindred products sectors

Agricultural marketing in the two-county area is dominated by livestock production and by poultry production in particul ar (breakdown by sources of agricultural income are shown in more detail later in the text). The importance of livestock marketing is shown in Figure 2.3. The top two panels of Figure 2.3. show agricultural receipts and expenses respectively in actual or nominal dollars. The two bottom panels show the same information expressed in constant prices (1999-2001 dollars). The two right hand panels of Figure 2.3. show that half of all agricultural expenses are just for purchases of feed and livestock. The increase in feed purchases repr esents the main avenue by which increased quantity of nutrients enter the region. It coul d be noted that there has been little increase

50in the purchases of fertilizer over the last two decades. The livestock marketing and purchases of feed and livestock are the majo r factors related to th e growth in the Food and Kindred products sector discussed above.

The indices with a base of 1991-93 were adjusted to a 1999-2000 base for this study. When the sales are shown in real prices, the data indicate that agricultura l output grew rapidly until 1990 and has been nearly constant through the last decade. The agricultural expenditure data indicates that real purchases of feed and livestock have declined slightly during the 1990’s. It should also be noted that expenditures for commercial fertilizer and lime represent a very small part of farm purchases and have been nearly constant since 1980.

The data presented in this summary s hows that although agriculture is not the predominant economic activity in the area, it is significant and dominated by the poultry sector. The poultry industry is an important economic factor for the two counties that share the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed. Political and Legislative Overview Legislative Overview One reason for the rapid increase in the number of poultry produced in the region was the relaxation of laws prohibiting corporate farming, first in Arkansas and latter in Oklahoma (Hipp, 2002). Following this regulator y relaxation, the presence of corporate

--- Page 94 ---
53swine and poultry farms increased dramatically. The regulatory relaxation increased protection against nuisance suits for concentrated animal feeding operations in Oklahoma, which attracted further growth of swine and poultry corporate farming. These concentrated animal feeding facilities tended to concentrate in relatively small geographic areas, Eastern Oklahoma and Western Arkans as for poultry and Western Oklahoma for swine, which contributed to relatively quick occurrence of the environmental problems. Public response to environmental problems and public concerns related to odor and water quality started emerging by 1997 wh en legislative actions against CAFOs began to dominate. Oklahoma House B ill 1552 set up licensing requirements and notification of surrounding landowners for new CA FO facilities, stipulated setback rules, required a pollution prevention plan and increased penalties and fines (Oklahoma State Senate, 1997). The Executive Order 97-07, estab lished the Governor’s Animal Waste and Water Quality Protection Task Force, a body intended to develop a plan with a mechanism for progressive monitoring of the state’s water quality and put forth recommendations for legislation, regulatory ch ange, structural and operational change, private-public partnerships, incentives, and other measures to protect the quality of Oklahoma’s water supply (Office of the Gover nor of Oklahoma, 1997). In the same year, The Oklahoma House Joint Resolution 1093 imposed moratorium on certain new hog farms until the next year or until new legi slation was passed (Oklahoma State Senate, 1997). Also in 1997, the Arkansas – Oklahoma Arkansas River Compact Commission adopted a goal to reduce phosphorus pollution in the Illinois river by 40 percent (Hipp, 2002). The following year, 1998 was also marked by intensive legislative and regulatory activity. The EPA issued the Unified Nationa l Strategy for Animal Feeding Operations,

--- Page 95 ---
54where the principles, goals and expectati ons for control of pollution from Animal Feeding Operations were set forth (EPA, 1998) . EPA amended and finalized this strategy with the Final Rules on Concentrated An imal Feeding Operations in December 2002 (EPA, 2002). Also in 1998, the Oklahoma legislature passed the Senate Bills 1170 and 1175 that imposed several additional requirements and restrictions on poultry farms and swine farms respectively (Oklahoma State Se nate, 1998). In particular, SB 1170 defined “nutrient threatened “ and “nutrient vulnerabl e” watersheds in Oklahoma. In response to the concentration of poultry litter in limited geographic areas, Oklahoma Legislature enacted the Oklahoma Poultry Waste Transfer Act in 2001, which provides tax relief to the parties that transport poultry waste from the regions where it is abundant and creates environmental problems (Eastern Oklahoma) to regions where phosphorus is in deficit (Central Oklahoma) (Oklahoma Statutes, 2001). Regulatory Overview On the regulatory stage, Oklahoma Wa ter Quality Standards (OWRB, 1996) designate the following beneficial uses for the lakes Eucha and Spavinaw in the watershed: public and private water supply, cool water aquatic community, agricultural irrigation, primary body contact recreation and aes thetics. Both lakes are also designated as sensitive drinking water supply. The Ok lahoma Water Resources Board (OWRB), through its Beneficial Uses Monitoring Program (BUMP) continuously monitors the compliance to the designated beneficial uses and has a regulatory power over the activities that endanger these uses. In a response to numerous complaints on odor and taste characteristics of the drinking water coming from the Lake Spavinaw, the OWRB conducted a comprehensive study on the water quality in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed

--- Page 96 ---
55(OWRB, 2002). The published report found that se veral of the designated beneficial uses of the lakes were impaired, most importantly the water supply and recreational uses. The report identified external phosphorus load as a main cause of impairment of lakes Eucha and Spavinaw. It further attributed most of the external phosphorus loading in the Lake Eucha to non-point agricultural sources and to a municipal point source in Arkansas. The report recommended a 54 percent reduction of total phosphorus load to the Lake Eucha and 44.6 percent reduction of total phosphorus load to the Lake Spavinaw to achieve the desired trophic state in the lakes. Overview of Litigation Actions Amid these reports and recommendations , the excessive phosphorus loading in the watershed continued, prompting the City of Tulsa to file a federal lawsuit against the poultry integrators and the municipality of Decatur, AR. On D ecember 10, 2001, the City of Tulsa and the Tulsa Metropolitan Utility Authority (City of Tulsa et al.,) filled a complaint in the US District Court of the Northern District of Oklahoma against Tyson Foods, Inc., Cobb-Vantress, Inc., Peterson Fa rms, Inc., Simmons Foods, Inc., Cargill, Inc., George’s, Inc., and the City of Decatur, Arkansas (Tyson Foods Inc. et al.). The complaint claimed that the defendants committed acts and omissions, which caused damages to the water supply of the City of Tulsa. The legal action sought damages and injunctive relief to remedy the wrongful pollution by the defendants. The complaint cited that the deleterious conditions of the water supply, in terms of nutrient loading in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed and consequent eutrophication of the lakes, were directly caused by the acts a nd omissions of the Defendants in the course of a “meteoric” growth in their business and pollution activities in the watershed. The

--- Page 97 ---
56massive concentration of the poultry operations in the watershed that is directly linked to the Defendants, results in enormous production of nutrient reach waste whose land application is directly responsible for the rapidly increasing levels of phosphorus in the lakes and is therefore a proximate cause of the eutrophication occurring in the lakes. In addition, the City of Decatur is alleged to contribute jointly with other Defendants to the pollution of the watershed by allowing e normous quantities of phosphorus discharge from its sewage treatment plant that also treats the wastewater from a poultry processing plant in the ownership of one of the other defendants. The complaint states that the Defendants have been aware of the rapidly increasing problems caused by their actions in the watershed. The City of Tulsa has plead ed and demanded the defendants eliminate their polluting activities, but to no effect. Based on these allegations the complaint requested punitive damages for the plaintiffs. The complaint also states that irreparable damage will be done if the polluting actions of the Defendants are not stopped. Therefore, the complaint requested an injunctive relief to prevent this irreparable harm. A lengthy pretrial process occurred afte r the complaint was filled. A number of expert witnesses were called for preliminary he arings. Just before the start of the trial, during the jury selection process, the parties announced out of court settlement. The settlement was announced on March 24 th, 2003 (Tulsa World, March 25, 2003). Details of the settlement are not yet available to the public, but it is expected that the settlement includes a mandate to the City of Decatur to upgrade its wastewater treatment. Just very recently, Tulsa World reported (Tulsa World, April 27 th, 2003), that the poultry integrators prevent their growers from litter application to their land and from selling and

--- Page 98 ---
57giving out litter to other farmers. It is belie ved that this new development is directly linked to the settlement. Definition of the Problems Treated in the Economic Analysis It is apparent from the numerous hydr ological studies conducted (Storm et al., 2002, ORWB, 2002, OCC, 1997) as well as from th e legislative and litigation actions that reductions of phosphorus loads to lakes Eucha and Spavinaw are required. Since it is estimated that some 25 percent of the tota l phosphorus in the watershed is generated by the City of Decatur point source and that over 65 percent of the load comes from agricultural enterprises, reductions of phos phorus emissions will have to be achieved from both sources. Economic theory and applied studies (Johansson, 2000, Jenq, 1982), show that when there are both point and non-point sources of pollution in a watershed, opportunities for tradeoffs in abatement betw een the two types of sources exist. In particular, there is an economically optimal, least-cost allocation of abatement between point and non-point sources for any given le vel of pollutant emissions. This optimal abatement corresponds to the point where the marginal abatement costs at the point source are just equal to the marginal abatem ent costs from the non-point sources. Stated differently, the optimal abatement for the point source is where the cost of removing another unit of pollution from the point source is equal to the cost of removing another unit of pollution from the non-point sources. In addition to point versus non-point s ource tradeoffs, there are considerable economic tradeoffs regarding the abatement among the non-point sources. If the non-

--- Page 99 ---
58point agricultural sources are heterogeneous (non identical), the optimal, least cost solution would require non-uniform levels of abatement at each non-point source. In particular, it would be optimal to abate more at the non-point sources that have lower marginal cost of abatement than at the non-poi nt sources that have higher marginal cost. At the optimal level of abatement, the marg inal costs are equated across all point and non-point sources of pollution. For the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed, the poi nt source of phosphorus loading is the City of Decatur that has a combined sewa ge treatment plant with a poultry processing facility located in the town. The municipality currently emits an effluent with very high concentration of phosphorus (ARDEQ, 2001) . The present study will consider a wastewater treatment technology that c ould be used to reduce the phosphorus concentration of the effluent. The cost to use this technology to attain a given phosphorus abatement level will be calculated. Most non-point sources of phosphorus loading come from agricultural activities in the watershed, whereby poultry litter is applied to various crops (pasture, hay, row crops). The study c onsiders several technologies and policies related to poultry litter management that coul d be used by agricultural producers in the watershed to reduce phosphorus loading. The costs of these technologies to the agricultural producers are calculated. Since the goal is to reduce total phos phorus loading in the watershed, an economic model was constructed to obtain a least cost solution to the set goal. The economic model was setup from the perspectiv e of a watershed manager interested in overall social well being. Abatement costs for point and the non-point sources were equated at the margin. In addition, the ec onomic model estimated the environmental

--- Page 100 ---
59damage costs caused by the phosphorus polluti on, represented by the additional cost for drinking water treatment and by the loss of r ecreational values of the area lakes. The model then determined the optimal level of phosphorus abatement, accounting for both costs to the polluters (point and non-point s ources) and costs to the parties that suffer from pollution (City of Tulsa, recreation users, etc). This optimal level of abatement was obtained by equating marginal abatement costs with the marginal environmental damage costs. In a summary, the goals of the economic analysis in this study were to: 1) Determine the socially optimal leve l of phosphorus abatement in the Eucha- Spavinaw watershed. 2) Determine the level of optimal phos phorus abatement at the point source, corresponding to a particular level of use of the abatement technology. 3) Determine the level of optimal phosphorus abatement from non-point sources. 4) Determine the most cost effectiv e technologies and policies to reduce phosphorus loading. 5) Determine the most efficient management practice (technology) for poultry litter and/particular policy for land use for each spatially distinct area in the watershed.

60CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS The conceptual framework for the economic analysis in this study is based on minimizing the sum of pollution abatement costs and environmental damage costs (Freeman, Haveman and Kneese, 1973). To explain this concept, let W represent the total social well-being. Then, the following relationship can be stated (2.1) W = M + E , where M represents the value of the market goods and services consumed in a society (poultry and agricultural crops for the study of interest), which are usually accounted for in the national accounts of a country and E represents the value of environmental services directly or indirectly consumed in a society (clean water). Define E* as the maximum potential value of environmental services obt ained from a pristine environment. Define D as the costs of environmental damages cau sed during the processes of production and consumption of market goods and services (ex. difference in drinking water treatment costs between treating polluted water and pr istine water). The value of environmental services actually provided is then (2.2) E = E* - D . Let M* denote the maximum value of market goods and services that could be produced in a society when no resources are devoted to pollution abatement. Then (2.3) M = M* - A, where A represents the costs associated to pollution abatement technologies (ex. more expensive poultry litter management practice th at reduces the phosphorus runoff, and/or more expensive treatment of the municipal wastewater). The total social well-being function can then be written by substituting Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) into Eq. (2.1) as

--- Page 102 ---
61(2.4) W = (M*- A) + (E*- D) =M* + E* - (A + D). Since M* and E* are fixed, the total social well- being can be maximized by minimizing the sum of pollution abatement costs and environmental damage costs. Suppose that both the abatement costs a nd the damage costs are function of a single pollutant ( p - phosphorus). It follows from Eq.(2.4) that the social well-being will also be a function of that pollutant. The following optimization problem arises (2.5) ( ))( )( * * )( max pDpA E M pW p+−+= . To obtain a solution to the above problem one needs to differentiate the well being function with respect to p and set the derivative equal to zero (2.6) dpdD dpdA dpdD dpdA dpdW= ⇒=−= - 0, where dA/dp represents marginal abatement (treatment) cost and dD/dp represents marginal environmental damage costs. The minus sign before the marginal abatement cost simply indicates that they are “read” from right to left. Marginal abatement cost is the change in treatment cost as an additiona l unit of pollutant is abated while marginal damage cost is the change in the cost of environmental damages as an additional unit of pollutant is discharged (not being abated). It follows directly from Eq. (2.6) that if the social well-being is to be maximized, the marginal abatement costs must be equal to the marginal environmental damage costs. Conse quently, the optimal level of abatement (the one that will maximize W) occurs when the marginal cost of abating an additional unit of pollutant is just equal to the marginal cost of environmental damages caused by that unit of pollutant.

62COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE PHOSPHORUS LOADING Non-Point Source Phosphorus Abatement T echnologies and Associated Abatement Costs Reducing Litter Application Rate One way to reduce phosphorus loading is to reduce the amount of litter applied. Since the agricultural enterprises in the wate rshed are heterogenous with respect to grown crops, soil types, and topography, it is to be expected that the optimal litter application rate would be different for each spatially dis tinct agricultural HRU. The optimality of the litter application rate is regarded here bot h in relation to the crop yield response to nutrients applied with the litter (nitrogen and phosphorus) and in relation to the phosphorus runoff from any given HRU. The goal of economic modeling is to allocate the litter produced in the watershed to the agricultural HRUs according to the economic criterion of highest value of the marginal pr oduct and at the same time to account for the total phosphorus loading at the watershed level In previous modeling (Storm et al.,2002), the litter was allocated on a sub-basin basis, by allocating the litter produced in ever y sub-basin uniformly to the agricultural uses in that sub-basin. In the present st udy, a transportation component to the economic model was developed that allowed for litte r shipment among the sub-basins in the watershed as well as shipping litter out of th e watershed. Transportation costs within the watershed were estimated using the distances between sub-basins calculated with the Network Analyst Extension for ArcView. Th e costs for transporting litter out of the watershed were approximated by using the potential for manure phosphorus application 1 The value of the marginal product is defined as the value of the product (crop yield) produced by using an additional unit of input (litter).

--- Page 104 ---
63of the surrounding counties in the states of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri (Gollehon et al., 2001) and estimated distances. The tr ansportation costs were computed by estimating the distance to haul the litter to the centroid of another county with sufficient capacity to receive manure phosphorus so that shipments of poultry litter could be made to that county. If the farmers were required to reduce or halt the application of poultry litter on their land, they may choose to replace nitr ogen by purchasing and applying commercial fertilizer. Under the profit maximization hypothe sis, the farmers should apply nutrients up to the point where the value of the margin al product from nutrients is equal to the marginal cost of purchasing commercial fertilizer. In most cases commercial nitrogen is more expensive than nitrogen from poultr y litter. Thus the study allows for lower nitrogen application rates with commercial fe rtilizer. Table 2.2, presents the alternative litter application rates by agricultural land uses in the watershed and the quantities of nitrogen applied under the two alternative stra tegies regarding nitrogen replacement with commercial fertilizer.

64Phosphorus could only be applied using pou ltry litter (no substitution possibility with commercial fertilizer) and for each litter app lication rate, the applied phosphorus was calculated as 1.5 percent of the applied quantity of litter. The litter and nitrogen application rates were based on fertilizati on recommendations. For grassland land uses (hay (HAY) and well-maintained pasture (WPAST)) the rates were based on OSU Extension Fact sheet F-2559. Based on reco mmendations, litter application rate of 4000 kg./ha was assumed as a base case applicati on rate. The two higher litter application rates (4800 kg/ha and 6000 kg/ha) assumed nitrogen al ways came from the poultry litter. The five lower application rates in Table 2.2 assu med that nitrogen could be replaced or not from commercial fertilizer. Overgrazed past ure (OPAS) was assumed to receive less fertilizer that well-maintained pasture (WPAS). For row crops, fertilizer recommendations were based on OSU enterprise budgets for grazeout wheat, and on recommendations for green beans from various sources. These recommendations are reflected in the base litte r application rate of 1300 kg/ha with two higher and five lower litter application rates. The SWAT model was run for each of the litter application rates and for the two nitrogen replacement strategies for a total of thirteen SWAT simulation runs. Yield, produced biomass, grazed biomass and phos phorus runoff was read from the SWAT output files for each of the 695 agricultural HR Us in the watershed. These results were used as inputs to the mathematical programming model discussed below. Net income from agricultural activities was estimated by using data from the SWAT model (yield and biomass data), th e Oklahoma State University Enterprise Budgets (OCES, 2003), from various pub lished (USDA, 2002) and from unpublished

Revenues for hay was calculated using the prices in Table 2.3 and the yields obtained from the SWAT output. Net income was obtained as difference betw een revenues and costs. Revenues for well- maintained and overgrazed pasture were estim ated using the exogenous price for beef and the calculated annual beef weight gain from the SWAT output. There was a difference in the cost structure for well-maintained and overgrazed pasture because of differences in management. Net income for the row crop wa s estimated by using the enterprise budget for grazeout wheat, the exogenous price for b eef and the SWAT based calculations for beef weight gain and an enterprise budget for green beans. Using Alum to Reduce Phosphorus Loading Aluminum sulfate has been known for its potential to tie up soil labile phosphorus and transform it into more stable alumi num phosphate compounds that are not readily

--- Page 107 ---
66soluble and hence are not available for plan t and algae uptake (Moore and Miller, 1994). The possibility to add aluminum sulfate to the litter was modeled using data published in Moore (1999). The alum product is added to litte r in the poultry house in ratio of 1 part alum to 10 parts litter. Alum ties up phos phorus, thereby significantly reducing the potential for soluble phosphorus runoff once the litter is applied to the agricultural land. The reduction of phosphorus runoff with alum addition is estimated using the experimental data published by Moore (1999) from a controlled small-scale watershed experiment. The experiments showed that the addition of alum reduced the phosphorus runoff attributed to litter application by 75 percent. This result may be represented as (2.7.) Prunoff alum = ((1- 0.75)(P current - P zero)) + P zero, where P current is the phosphorus runoff under given litter application rate and P zero is the phosphorus runoff under zero application ra te. Phosphorus runoff occurs even if no litter is applied because of phosphorus already in the soil. The net income estimates from the agricultural activities in HRUs where alum was added to the litter were lowered by 2 percent. Some studies found that the use of alum sulfate increases the income to the poultry growers, which is attributable to the reduction of ammonia emissions and consequent reductions of health relate d costs and ventilation costs as well as improvement in growth performance (Moore, 1999). However, a confirmation to this finding is not widely observed in the practice. Even if these economic effects of treating the litter with alum are present, they pertain to the poultry growers and integrators and are not necessarily passed on to crop and cattle growers. The reason for this may be asymmetric information and/or income distri bution problems. It is conceivable to think

--- Page 108 ---
67that adding alum would inflict some costs, at least to crop producing farmers. Therefore a small, arbitrary reduction of income was assumed. The possibility to add alum to the litter is treated as management practice for reduction of phosphorus loading in the waters hed. Alum treated litter was regarded as a resource separate from the non-treated litter. In effect, the economic model takes the litter as produced in the poultry house and either a llocates it to alum treated or non-treated litter. Both types of litter can be shipped between the sub-basins in the watershed. Finally, the model can apply one of the two types of litter at previously defined litter application rates to each agricultural HRU in the watershed. The litter application rates are the same as described in Table 2.2. Thus , including alum, the various litter application rates and the two strategies for nitrogen repl acement there were twenty-four distinct litter management activities defined for each of th e 694 HRU’s (13 SWAT runs which can be either with alum treated or non-treated litter except for the zero litter application rate, where obviously no alum is applied, hence 13 + 11 = 24). Litter Application According to Soil Test Phosphorus (STP) Another possible management strategy for the watershed as a whole would be to allow litter application only to those soils where th e Soil Test Phosphorus is not higher than certain prescribed values. For Oklahoma, this value is often stated as a STP value of 120 (120 lbs of P per acre), as de scribed in OSU Extension Fact sheet F-2249. At this value, the soil has sufficient phosphorus that could be used for plant uptake. A high proportion of any additional phosphorus applied to thos e soils would runoff during storm events. Therefore, the usual recommendation is not to apply poultry litter on the soils with STP higher than 120. This recommendation was not followed in the Eucha-Spavinaw

--- Page 109 ---
68watershed in the past, especially not on the Arkansas side of the watershed where the litter is continuously used for its nitrogen fe rtilizer value. Thresholds of 200, 250 and 350 lbs per acre were also considered 2. The strategy of applying poultry litter only to soils with STP values lower than a given threshold is directed toward reduc ing phosphorus loading in the watershed by preventing the runoff of the excess phosphorus during the storm events. This strategy is representative of the “command and control” regulatory approach, where threshold standards are set and enforced. This po licy was modeled by not allowing for litter application on the agricultural land where STP was higher than a given threshold value. On the land where litter application wa s allowed (STP lower than a given threshold value) various litter application rates, using alum treated or untreated litter were allowed as modeling options. Net income from agricultural activities for both HRU’s that received litter and those that did not was cal culated using the procedures and data described above. Mandatory abatement at the point source level was coupled with the STP based litter application policy. Instituting mandatory point source abatement has the characteristics of “command and control” regulatory approach and is consistent with the STP based watershed management strategy. The rationale for this was that if the “watershed manager” were going to use the STP based criterion for the non-point sources, it would have used the mandatory ab atement at the point source as well. The 2 Litter application is not recommended to any soil w ith STP higher than 120. In the economic analysis however the threshold values of 200, 250 and 350 were also included, to analyze the changes in the net income and in the transportation patterns when the STP criterion is relaxed.

--- Page 110 ---
69mandatory abatement at the point source was set to achieve phosphorus concentration of the effluent of 1 mg/l. The main issue from an economic perspec tive, is that the litter produced in the watershed has to be either land applied in the watershed (or used in some other activity, like methane and electricity generation) or be transported out of the watershed. If litter application is restricted only to soils with STP values lower than 120 or other threshold value, a great proportion of litter produced in the watershed could not be land applied. This was modeled by allowing for transportation of excess litter outside of the watershed. The distances necessary to haul litter out of the watershed were determined by locating counties in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma to the East, North, West and South of the watershed where there is a potential for manure phosphorus application (Gollehon et al ., 2001). Average transportation cost s were calculated using average distance to the counties centroids in each direction and per ton mile transportation cost. Changes in Land Use Patterns Directed Towards Reduction of Phosphorus Loading As noted above, the agricultural land in the watershed is classified into four land use classes. Figure 2.5 represents the distribution of land area by agricultural land uses. 13402 654223250 2625 0500010000150002000025000 HAY OAST WPAS WWHTLand use in hectares HAY = hay, OAST = overgrazed pasture, WPAS = maintained pasture, WWHT = row crop. Figure 2.6. Agricultural Land Area by Land Uses in the Eucha-Spavinaw Watershed

--- Page 111 ---
70As shown in Figure 2.5, the greatest land area is occupied by well-maintained pasture, followed by hay, overgrazed pasture and row cr op. However, previous studies (Storm et al., 2002) (Ancev et al., 2003) found that despite the small land area they occupy, overgrazed pasture and row crop contribute relatively more to the phosphorus loading than do hay and well-maintained pasture. It wa s therefore decided to model the effect of potential land use change, whereby a conversion of overgrazed pasture to well-maintained pasture and conversion of row cr ops to hay was simulated. The decision was based on the fact that overgrazed pasture is situated on the land with similar characteristics to the well-maintained pasture, and main differences between the two land uses are with respect to quantity of applied nutrients (nitrogen, lower for the overgrazed pasture) and the minimum biomass when th e grazing is allowed to begin (minimum biomass is lower for the overgrazed pasture). The parameters that control these characteristics were reconfigured in the SWAT model to simulate the land use conversion. In a similar fashion the conversi on from row crop to hay was simulated. The same rates of litter application as descri bed in Table 2.2 were used for the newly simulated agricultural enterprises in the watershed. Net income from the agricultural activities was calculated according to previously described procedures and data. The study simulated two types of la nd use change policies. One type corresponded to mandatory uniform conversion where all land under overgrazed pasture and row crop was converted to well-maintain ed pasture and hay respectively. The other policy type corresponded to site-specific ( optimal) land use conversion, where land areas were chosen for conversion based on th eir economic characteristics and phosphorus runoff potential.

71Point Source Phosphorus Abatement Techno logy and Associated Abatement Costs The City of Decatur, Arkansas is a ma jor source of phosphorus loading in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed. The reason is that the Peterson Farms poultry processing plant is located there. As is case in many small communities in the US (Rossi, Young and Epp, 1979), the wastewater treatment proce ss for the municipality and the processing plant is combined in order to achieve greater economic efficiency. The current wastewater treatment system in the City of Decatur consists of treatment in bioreactors. This system discharges on average 1.16 million gallons per day (MGD) of flow into a surface water stream (Colombia Hollow). Some of the characteristics of the effluent are presented in the following table. Table 2.4. Average Characteristics of the Efflue nt from the City of Decatur Sewage Treatment Plant for the period 1/31/1990 to 3/31/2001 Source: Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality * Measures of P concentration start from 11/30/1997. Table 2.4 shows the effluent has a ve ry high phosphorus concentration. The literature reports a value of around 1 mg./l phosphorus concentration of the effluent when using best available technology (Metcalf&Eddy, 2003). The concentration of the effluent from Decatur exceeds this benchmark by more than six times and consequently contributes an average of 11,686 kilograms of phosphorus per year to lake Eucha. This represents 24 percent of the estimated to tal phosphorus load of 48,000 kilograms (Storm et al., 2002). Therefore, a reduction of phosphorus concentration in the effluent from the Average Daily Flow Average pH value Average concentration of phosphorus* Average concentration of nitrates Average concentration of ammonia Average concentration of BOD MGD Value mg./l mg./l mg./l mg./l 16 6.647 6.549 25.09 8.05 3.74

72City of Decatur may provide significant and cost effective reduction of total phosphorus load. In order to model the cost of phosphorus abatement in the wastewater effluent from the City of Decatur, a specific design for the additional wastewater treatment had to be modeled. A system of chemical treatment using aluminum sulfate was chosen due to its relative simplicity and cost effectiveness for comparably small treatment plants. The process is based on the chemical reaction involving the aluminum ion (Metcalf&Eddy), (2.8) Al +++ + H n PO 43-n ↔ AlPO 4 + nH+. The aluminum ion precipitates phosphorus as flocs of aluminum phosphate that can be removed from wastewater in a fo rm of sludge. The effectiveness of alum precipitation for reduction of phosphorus concen tration in wastewater has been reported for a number of North American and European wastewater treatment plants (Klute and Herman, 1994), (WPCF, 1983). The particular design used to estimat e the costs of phosphorus abatement is presented in the Appendix Figure A.2.1. The design consists of several components: Structures and equipment for alum addition; Settling basin for flocs; Gravity thickener for primary sludge; Liquid/Solid Separation fo r secondary sludge; Transportation and landfilling of wastewater treatment residuals (WWTR). 1) Structures and Equipment for Alum addition The structures and equipment for alum a ddition consist of storage for the alum product, conveyors, feeder, dissolver, holdi ng tank, a pump and a flocculation chamber. The design and cost estimation is based on EPA, (1980), Fact Sheet 5.1.1. Since the cost

--- Page 114 ---
73calculations by EPA (1980) are based on an al um dose of 200mg./l , the effective flow was calculated for alternative alum dosages by using the suggested formula: QE = Q D * (Actual Alum Dose / 200 mg/l), where Q E is the effective flow and Q D is the design flow (equal to the average daily flow of 1.16 MGD). Construction costs for each effec tive flow were then read from the cost curve provided in the fact sheet. Operation a nd maintenance cost net of chemical cost (since the alum usage and price ($0.06/lbs) we re obtained outside the fact sheet) for each effective flow were also read from the corre sponding cost curve. Since the cost data in the fact sheet are expressed in 1976 prices, th e costs were inflated by the factor 2.4514 to obtain current cost levels. This factor was determined by using an inflation calculator for adjusting costs from one year to anothe r using the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Deflator inflation index available at NASA web site (NASA, 2003). The inflation calculator is based on the inflation rate dur ing the US Government Fiscal Year, which begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. The calculator is able to compute inflation for years 1940 to 2005. The construction costs (capital costs) were annualized using the suggested 20-year amortization period and 6 percent interest ra te. Total annual costs of alum addition were obtained as a sum of annualized capital costs and operation and maintenance cost. 2) Settling basin for flocculation. After alum is added and flocculation is completed, the wastewater is directed toward a settling tank where the flocs settle a nd form sludge, which is collected in the bottom of the tank and released from ther e. The designed size of the settling tank was

--- Page 115 ---
74based on hydraulic retention time of 120 minut es, degree of flocculation of 30, on mean velocity gradient of 20, and safety factor of 10 percent (Henze et al.,1983). The capacity of the settling tank was cal culated at 106,400 gallons as a function of the average daily flow of wastewater a nd the required retention time, increased by the safety factor percentage. The cost of c onstructing the settling tank was obtained by using the data from MEANS Construction Costs ( 2000) (page 444). The costs for the desired capacity were extrapolated using the estimated function: Y = 8.19*X -.3815, where Y is the cost in $/gallon and X is the capacity of the tank in thousand gallons. It was assumed that the sludge settled and removed from the settli ng tank contained 2 percent solids (Sitig, 1969). The relationship between sludge creati on and alum addition was adopted from Klute and Hahn (1994) as 7 grams of sludge for each gram of alum added. 3) Gravity thickener for primary sludge After exiting the settling tank, the sludge is directed through a gravity thickener in order to achieve higher concentration of solid s and reduce the disposal costs. The design of gravity thickening process and estimation of associated costs were also based on EPA (1980), Fact Sheet 6.3.7. The calculations assumed three days retention time. The effective flow for various alum dosages and hence for various sludge quantities were calculated according to the proposed formula: Q E = Q D * [new sludge mass / 820 lb/MGD of flow], where Q E is the effective flow and Q D is the design flow (average daily flow of 1.16 MGD). The construction costs were read from the cost curve in the fact sheet for each effective flow. Operation and maintenance costs were calculated in a similar manner

--- Page 116 ---
75using the provided cost curve. Costs were tr anslated to current prices using the above- mentioned inflation calculator. The construc tion costs were annualized using a 20 year amortization period and 6 percent interest ra te. Total annual costs were calculated as a sum of the annualized construction and operati on costs. The solids concentration of the sludge exiting the gravity thickener was assumed to be 10 percent. 4) Liquid/Solid Separation for secondary sludge The sludge from the thickener was passed over an inclined screen separator in order to achieve greater solids concentration. The cost of separation is a function of the volume of sludge coming from the thickener, which was directly related to the alum dosage used. The Department of Agricultura l Economics, Oklahoma State University has developed a swine waste management decisi on support system, which contains a routine for calculating Liquid/Solid separation costs (Ancev, Stoecker and Carreira, 2001). The decision support system was used to generate estimates of separation costs for various volumes of sludge coming form the thickener. Final waste materials after the separation were wastewater residuals that contain 40-50 percent solids. 5) Transportation and landfilling of wastewater treatment residuals (WWTR) It was assumed the WWTR were transported 10 miles to a landfill site at cost of $20 per cubic yard, (MEANS 2000, page 64). A landfilling fee of $40 per ton was also assumed (MEANS 2000, page 50). The actual cost calculations for all alum dosages are given in the Appendix Table A.2.1. These costs in effect represent abatemen t costs at the point source. For each alum

--- Page 117 ---
76dosage there is a corresponding level of phosphorus abatement and associated abatement cost. Abatement costs at the point source of phosphorus loading are used subsequently in the mathematical programming model, to de termine marginal abatement costs for the whole watershed. ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE COSTS The study focused only on two types of environmental damages caused by phosphorus pollution in the watershed. One was the impairment of the quality of drinking water for the City of Tulsa (OWRB, 2002) and the other was the loss of recreational values of the area lakes, as reflected in the drastic reduction in the reported number of annual visits (OCC, 1997, OTRD, 2003)). Other possible environmental damages, such as long-term ecological values, were not treated because of lack of data. Costs for Additional Drinking Water Treatment The costs of additional drinking water treatment to the City of Tulsa are dependent on the taste and odor characteristics of the water, which are in turn determined by the concentration levels of the two chem icals, Geosmin and MIB (methyl iso-borneol) in the drinking water. These chemicals are pr oduced in the process of algae die-off and are believed to cause the bad odor and ta ste of the water (OWRB, 2002). The OWRB conducted a thorough analysis on the algae co mmunity and chemicals related to water odor and taste in the Eucha and Spavinaw lakes. The study found increasing algae population in the lakes and increasing producti on of Geosmin and MIB. In recent years,

--- Page 118 ---
77the City of Tulsa has closely monitored th e odor and taste characteristics of its water supply. Figure 2.6 provides information about th e Geosmin and MIB concentration in the water at the lake Eucha Dam, as well as the taste and odor complaints for supplied water. To control the odor and taste causing ch emicals, the Tulsa Municipal Utility Authority (TMUA) is using additional filtra tion with powdered activated carbon at the Mohawk water treatment plant. Alternativel y, the raw water supply to the Mohawk plant was occasionally diverted from Lake Spavinaw to Lake Hudson.

Geosmin and MIB Concentration and Taste and Odor Complaints. Thus, the costs imposed on the City of Tulsa due to high concentrations of Geosmin and MIB, consist of costs for add itional use of powdered activated carbon in water treatment and costs of pumping from an alternative water reservoir. The powdered activated carbon (PAC) is effective in rem oving odor and improving the taste of drinking

--- Page 119 ---
78water (AWWA, 2001), but is quite costly (the price of PAC is $0.2/kg.). Diverting the water supply from Lake Spavinaw to wate r supply from Lake Hudson greatly reduces chemical treatment costs (very little or no PAC used) but inflicts high pumping costs ($61.44 per million gallons). The data on water treatment costs were obtained from the City of Tulsa. Regression analysis was used to estimate the costs for the additional drinking water treatment to the City of Tulsa. Ob served average annual costs for PAC use and pumping costs from Lake Hudson were regre ssed on the SWAT simulated average levels of phosphorus loading in the watershed. The estimated equation (t-values in parenthesis) (2.9) C T t = -226394 + 11.14 Z t , (-5.36) (10.08) where CTt denotes the average annual costs to th e City of Tulsa at phosphorus loading level t, and Zt is the observed average phosphorus load of level t, had an R2 of 0.971. The estimated equation indicates strong positive linear relationship between the average annual phosphorus loading in the watershed a nd the average annual costs of additional drinking water treatment for the City of Tuls a. This is expected since the high phosphorus load results in intensive algae growth, which in turn results in production of Geosmin and MIB. It should be noted that average annual da ta were analyzed and that the distribution of costs and phosphorus loading within a y ear reflects the lagged effects of phosphorus loading on the Geosmin and MIB production. Resu lts from the regression analysis were used in the subsequent computations of th e total and marginal environmental damage costs.

79 Costs of Reduced Recreational Values The Eucha-Spavinaw watershed is located in the Ozark region of East Oklahoma, and is characterized with hilly landscape, forested areas and attractive water bodies. This makes the region attractive for recreation activities th at range from picnicking and fishing to camping and motor boating. The watershed is hom e to two state parks, Lake Eucha State Park and Spavinaw State Park, which were once very popular recreational sites. However, during the last decade the number of recreational visits to the two state parks decreased sharply (OTRD, 2003). This is in spite of the fact that the number of visits to the state parks for the whole region of Nort h-East Oklahoma remained fairly stable during the same time period. Figure 2.7. pres ents combined data on the number of visitors to the Eucha-Spavinaw state pa rks over the 1990-2001. Figure 2.8. presents data on the number of visitors to all state parks in North -East Oklahoma for the same period.

80As Figure 2.7 suggests, the two state park s have experienced sharp drop in the annual number of visitors, from 265,000 visits in 1990 to a little less than 100,000 visits in 2001. In the same time, the number of recreati onal visits to all state parks in the North Eastern Oklahoma remained relatively stable at about 3,300,000 per year.

Number of Annual Recreational Visits to All State Parks in North Eastern Oklahoma. This reduction in the number of visits to Eucha and Spavinaw State Parks may be interpreted as a shift of recreational visits away from lakes Eucha and Spavinaw and toward other recreational sites in the ar ea for the period 1990-2001. During this period, a significant increase in phosphorus loading in the watershed occurred and was followed by the increases in the phosphorus concentration in the lakes. This in turn ultimately resulted in eutrophication and in reduction of the subjective value of recreational experience (Feenberg and Mills, 1980). In the same peri od, there were significant public debates and numerous media reports regarding phosphorus pollution and the poultry industry in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed (Tulsa World, va rious issues). The effect of the actual

--- Page 122 ---
81increase in the phosphorus loading to the la kes combined with the media reports and public debates, most probably played an impor tant role leading toward drastic reduction of annual visits to the Eucha and Spavinaw La kes. The analysis of the available visitation data for the Oklahoma State Parks did not rev eal any other significant aspect that could be used to explain the reduction of annual visitation to the Eucha/Spavinaw state parks. This reduction in annual visitation however, implies monetary costs to the current participants in recreation that travel to other sites when they would prefer a recreational experience at Eucha/Spavinaw state parks, were the water quality acceptable (revealed preference). Losses also accrue to current non-participants in recreation who would participate in recreation at Eucha/Spavinaw state parks if the phosphorus loading to the lakes were lower. These monetary losses can be expressed in economic terms as losses of Consumer Surplus. Consumer Surplus measur es the gain for the consumer from being able to buy a product (recreation) of a gi ven quality (phosphorus concentration, water clarity) below its reservation price (maximum willingness-to-pay). This is graphically represented in Figure 2.9. d CS P Demand Q Figure 2.10. Illustrative Example of Consumer Surplus. In the figure, the horizontal axis represen ts the quantity (number of visits) and the vertical axis represents the price (cost of trav el to the site, cost of entrance fee etc.). Let d

--- Page 123 ---
82represent the maximum willingness-to-pay for the recreation at a particular site, corresponding to a price above which no visits to the site would be made. At prices lower than this, some visits to the r ecreational sites will be made. Let P denote the actual price that has to be paid to travel to and experi ence recreation at a given site. Then, the triangle area labeled CS denotes the consumer surplus at the price P. As the actual price increases the consumer surplus declines, while as the actual price decreases the consumer surplus rises. In economic terms, the consumer surplus is known as the area under the demand curve and above the price. The travel cost method, which uses costs of travel to the recreation sites to represent the price for recreation, was used to derive the costs of lost recreational values due to increased phosphorus loading and phos phorus concentration of the area lakes (Bockstael et al., 1991). The concept of travel cost uses estimates of the costs to travel to and from a recreational site, as well as the co sts for preparation, gear, and entrance fees, to estimate a demand function for recreation at a particular site. The costs of lost recreational values are approximated as changes in the consumer surplus under various levels of phosphorus concentration in the lake s. In particular, it was assumed that the maximum willingness-to-pay (MWTP) for recreation changes as the phosphorus concentration in the lake changes. At hi gher levels of phosphorus concentration the MWTP for recreation is lower, while at lo wer levels of phosphorus concentration the MWTP is higher. This is graphically re presented in Figure 2.10 where the number of visits decline from Q 1 to Q2 as the MWTP declines from d1 to d2. In the figure, d1 corresponds to maximum willingness-to-pay for recreation at better water quality, say WC 1 (lower phosphorus concentration), while d2 corresponds to

Changes in Consumer Surplus from Recreation under Various Levels of Phosphorus Concentration in the Lakes due to Changes in the Maximum Willingness-to-Pay maximum willingness-to-pay for recreation at lower water quality, WC 2 (higher phosphorus concentration). Consumer surplus under the better water quality is represented by the triangle area bounded by d 1, P and C1. Consumer surplus under the lower water quality is represented by the triangle area bounded by d2, P and C2. The difference between them, marked by the area d1, d2, C1 and C2 represents the change in consumer surplus. This change can be interpreted as a benefit obtained by increasing water quality from WC 2 to WC 1, or equivalently as a loss in recreational values when the water quality decreases from WC 1 to WC 2. This concept is used to empirically estimate the losses in recreational values under altern ative phosphorus concentrations of water in the Eucha and Spavinaw lakes. Data on annual visitations to the Eucha and Spavinaw state parks were obtained from the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation De partment (OTRD, 2003). Visitors to the lakes were divided in iso-travel cost zone s according to survey results published in a report by the Oklahoma Conservation Commi ssion (OCC, 1997). The iso-travel cost zones are geographic zones from which it would cost approximately the same to travel to

--- Page 125 ---
84a given recreational site. Four iso-travel zones were identified for the lakes Eucha and Spavinaw: Zone 1 – Tulsa Metropolitan Area, Zone 2 - Siloam Springs and Fayetteville, AR, Zone 3- visitors from Oklahoma other than Tulsa (mainly including cities and towns on the East of Tulsa), and Zone 4 – Local area (communities of Jay, Spavinaw and other smaller communities). Travel cost from each zone was calculated using road distances and average gasoline consumption and prices. The value of time spend on recreation (McConnel, 1992) was incorporated in the travel cost estimates using income data (USDC, 2000) to estimate the hourly earnings. Demand equation for recreation in price flexibility form was estimated according to the following model (2.10.) TC l = ∑ =12 11 kk kDd + d 2Ql, where TCl denotes the travel cost to the recreational site from the lth zone, d1k denotes maximum willingness-to-pay at a given level of phosphorus concentration, Dk is a dummy variable for each level of phosphorus concentration (twelve levels, k), and Ql is the observed number of visits from the zone l 3. The results from the estimation are presented in Table A2.3 in the Appendi x. The estimated maximum willingness–to–pay parameters were regressed on the observe d phosphorus concentration to yield the following estimated equation (t-values in parenthesis) (2.11.) d 1k = 72.7 – 788.5 PCk , (4.93) (-2.1) where PC is the observed phosphorus concentration in the lakes. Data published in OWRB, 2002, pp-120-121 were used to convert the phosphorus concentration to 3 Dummy variable ( or indicator variable) in this case is defined as unity at some particular level of k and zero otherwise . For example, D1 =1 for d11 and zero otherwise.

85phosphorus loading. Consequently, distinct in tercepts (maximum willingness-to-pay) for each level of phosphorus loading in the waters hed were calculated. The calculation of the consumer surplus and the change in the c onsumer surplus at the various levels of phosphorus load were conducted using the sta ndard procedures as described above. The results are provided in Table A 2.3. in the Appendix. Estimates for Total and Marginal Environmental Damage Costs The sum of costs for drinking water treatme nt that City of Tulsa incurs and the cost of recreational losses calculated a bove result in an estimate of the total environmental damage cost for the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed 4. As noted in the conceptual framework presentation, derivati on of the marginal environmental damage costs may be quite useful for the further discussion. The marginal damage costs could be obtained by first expressing the total damage costs as a function of phosphorus lo ad and by differentiating the function with respect to the phosphorus load. The estimated total damage cost as a function of phosphorus load in the watershed was (t-values in parenthesis) (2.12.) DC= 585446.9 – 59.93 Zmax + 0.0015 Zmax 2, (10.25) (-15.45) (25.18) where DC is the total damage cost and Z is the phosphorus load in the watershed. The marginal damage cost is then (2.13.) MDC = -59.93 + 0.003 Zmax . Marginal damage costs expressed in this way are used in the subsequent discussion. 4 The word “total” here is meant to make a distin ction from the word “marginal” . It is not claimed that these environmental cost estimates comprise all possibl e environmental damages in the watershed, so that the word “total” does not have a meaning of “all” environmental damages.

86 LINEAR PROGRAMMING SOLUTIONS To find the least cost way to achieve a ny given level of phosphorus loading in the watershed, litter management practices are to be optimally allocated to agricultural enterprises (non-point sources of phosphorus loading), and the level of wastewater treatment is to be optimally assigned to the wastewater treatment plant at the City of Decatur (point source of phosphorus loading). In particular, the objective of the model was set to maximize the sum of agricultural income from all agricultural HRUs in the watershed minus the costs to the point source and the costs of transportation of litter, by choosing litter management practices and wastewater treatment level to meet a certain limit on total phosphorus loading in the entire watershed. This is best represented in the linear programming framework, which can be mathematically stated as, (2.14.1) bbB btsr ssr rtq q q qijN ijijYXctTt cTt Y Z PSC X qij∑∑ ∑∑∑ ∑ ∑∑ == === = ==− − −Π 12 1695 1695 12 135 1 1695 1,*)( * max subject to (2.14.2) 1 =∑ iijX and Xij ≥ 0 (Select the most profitable BMP in each HRU) (2.14.3) ∑= qqY 1 and Yq ≥ 0 (Select a level of phosphorus abat. at point source) (2.14.4) Ts = ∑ =2 1tstT (t =1 for litter without alum, 2 for alum) (2.14.5) Tst = T sst + T rst - T rst , s ≠ r (All litter applied or shipped out of the watershed) (2.14.6) Zq +∑∑ ==≤N ijij ij Z XZ 1694 1max, (total phosphorus loading less than Z max)

--- Page 128 ---
87where: Πij is the net income from the ith BMP in jth HRU, Xij denotes the adoption of the ith BMP in the jth HRU. PSC q is point source abatement cost for the qth level of phosphorus abatement ( Yq). Ts is the total quantity of litter in produced in sth subbasin. Ttsr is the quantity of litter with treatment t shipped from the sth to the rth sub basin5. ctsr is the cost of transporting litter with treatment t from the sth to the rth sub-basin. Tb is the quantity of litter shipped out of the watershed from point b. Zij is the amount of phosphorus runoff in tons from the jth HRU under the ith BMP. Zq is the qth level of phosphorus loading from the point source. Zmax is total allowed phosphorus loading, The quantity of allowed phosphorus loading in the watershed, Zmax was varied from 18000 to 46000 kilograms per year. Th e upper level of 46000 kg./year corresponds to the estimate of total current phosphorus loading in the watershed from the non-point agricultural sources and the point source (Storm et al., 2002). The lowest level of 18000 kg/year corresponds to the estimated phosphorus load if no litter were applied in the watershed and if all agricultural land us es received the required nitrogen from commercial fertilizer, and also there were no phosphorus loading from the point source (maximum abatement at the point source) 6. The intermediate phosphorus loading targets, (40000, 35000, 30000, 25000, 20000 (all in kg/year)) were chosen to determine how the marginal abatement cost curve changed as the amount of abatement changed. The program was solved using standard MPS linear programming format in the C-WHIZ Version 4 Linear Programming Optimizer (Ketron Management Science). 5 The SWAT model divides the watershed in total of sixty nine subbasins. 6 In the modeling of phosphorus loading within the SWAT framework the quantity of nitrogen applied, whether from litter or commercial fertilizer is of great importance. If too little or no nitrogen is applied, the agricultural land uses will have fairly low intensity of land cover, which will promote higher erosion and runoff. For this reason, hydrologic modelers use constant quantity of nitrogen applied to determine the effects of variation of litter appli cation on phosphorus loading. In an economic analysis however, allowing for a choice whether to substitute nitrogen with commercial fertilizer when litter application is reduced is of significant importance as discussed above.

--- Page 129 ---
88 As noted above, the notation Xij denotes the ith litter management practice which can be chosen in the jth HRU of the watershed. The basic litter management practices were described above as twenty-four distinct activities (eight litter application rates using either alum treated or non-treated litter and substituting for nitrogen with commercial fertilizer for lower litter application rates). Th ese base activities were used for the linear programming runs under four distinct simulate d policies. The policies differ by the set of choices (options) available for reducing phosphorus loading in the watershed from the non-point sources. The abatement technology at the point source was the same across each of the alternative policies, but the amount of abatement was optimally chosen. Policy 1 – Using the Litter Management Practices The first policy was the one that used only the described basic twenty-four litter management practices and point source abatement to meet a phosphorous target. The linear program was solved to maximize the sum of the net income from agricultural activities in the watershed, minus the cost of the point source abatement, less the cost for litter transportation. The model selected one of the twenty-four basic litter management practices for each particular HRU in the watershed and a level of phosphorus abatement at the point source. This policy was used to simulate the possibilities for short-run reduction of phosphorus loading in the wate rshed by transporting litter across individual sub-basins, varying litter application rates, using alum as a litter amendment, choosing whether to substitute nitrogen with commercia l fertilizer, and choosing the optimal level of phosphorus abatement at the point source. The linear programming model was run for each level of allowed phosphorus loading in the watershed, ( Zmax, the phosphorus

--- Page 130 ---
89constraint was parametrically varied). Re sults from the linear programming runs are presented in the following section. Of particular interest in the analysis of this policy was to observe the use of alum, the intensity of transportation within the watershed, the average litter application rates for soil type-la nd use, and the level of abatement at the point source, as the allowed phosphorus load ing for the watershed was parametrically reduced. Policy 2 – Applying Litter According to the STP Criterion The next policy considered was the app lication of poultry litter according to the soil test phosphorus (STP) criterion. As di scussed before, there are numerous policy recommendations that litter application would be allowed only on the land that meets a certain phosphorus based criteria. One such criterion is the STP, which uniformly classifies the soils according to their phosphorus content. Another criterion that addresses better the specific characteristics of individual soils and land uses is the Phosphorus Risk Index (PRI) (Storm and Smolen, 2001). Although PRI is generally preferred, especially from an economic standpoint, its practical app lication is fairly limited. At present time a research effort is underway at Oklahoma State University, which attempts to classify the soils in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed accordi ng to the PRI criterion. However, since the results from that research are still not availa ble, a policy that uses the STP criterion was simulated in the present study. Under this policy, litter application is onl y allowed on soils that have STP lower than a certain threshold value 7. All other land cannot receive poultry litter. For the agricultural HRUs that do not receive litter, required nitrogen could either be replaced by commercial fertilizer or not. In the linear pr ogramming framework, in effect, there were 7 Threshold values of 120, 200, 250 and 350 STP were analyzed.

--- Page 131 ---
90just two options available for the HRUs that do not receive litter, to substitute or not for nitrogen using commercial fertilizer. If the nitrogen was substituted, the phosphorus load from a particular HRU was reduced due to im proved plant growth and better land cover. (nitrate runoff however may increase). At th e same time, net agricultural income was reduced due to the cost of commercial fertili zer and its application. For the HRUs that were allowed to receive litter (STP lower than a particular threshold value) the twenty- four basic litter management practices we re available as options in the linear programming runs. Abatement at the point source was modeled as mandated by a regulation, so a full abatement to a leve l of 1 mg/l phosphorus concentration of the effluent was simulated. The linear program was run to maximize the sum of the net income from agricultural activities in the watershed minus the litter transportation cost by choosing one of the twenty-four basic litter ma nagement practices for HRUs that were allowed to receive litter in the watershed, and by choosing whether to replace the required nitrogen by commercial fertilizer or not for HRUs that were not allowed to receive litter. Note that under this policy ther e is no constraint on the phosphorus loading. The policy in itself implies phosphorus abati ng actions (not applying litter to high STP soils) and a further constraint on phosphorus would be infeasible from political and regulatory aspects. Therefore, the total phos phorus constraint was “freed” in the linear program to reflect this situation. The linear programming model was run for four levels of STP thresholds (120, 200, 250, 350). Results from the linear programming runs are presented in the following section. Of particular interest for this policy was to observe the transportation activities

--- Page 132 ---
91within and out of the watershed, the use of commercial nitrogen by agricultural land uses and the litter application rates on the HRUs where litter application was allowed. Policy 3 – Mandatory Land Use Conversion The third policy analyzed in the study assumed mandatory changes in agricultural land use patterns in the watershed. This polic y is used to represent a simulation of a mandatory (uniform) conversion of overgr azed pasture to maintained pasture and conversion of row crop to hay. Since the ove rgrazed pasture and row crop land uses were identified as contributing the most to th e phosphorus loading, the simulated policy comprised of a mandatory order to the land owners to convert those two land uses to well-maintained pasture and hay respectively. These changes in land use patterns in the watershed present a significant opportunity fo r phosphorus load reduction, but are only attainable in the longer run and require changes in the economic structure of the agriculture and related industry in the waters hed. Also, mandatory land use change may not be very popular and for that matter politically feasible policy. SWAT model was used to simulate the conversion of the overgrazed pasture to maintained pasture and from row crops to hay. The SWAT simulation provided estimates of the phosphorus load, crop yield, and biom ass for the newly converted HRUs. For the HRUs where the conversion was conducted, the calculations of the net agricultural income were repeated for the newly assi gned land uses. The basic twenty-four litter management practices were then used as options in the linear programming model. The linear program was run to maximize th e sum of the net income from hay and maintained pasture agricultural activities in th e watershed minus the abatement cost at the

--- Page 133 ---
92point source and the litter transportation cost by choosing one of the twenty-four basic litter management practices for each HRU, and by choosing a level of phosphorus abatement at the point source. The linear programming model was run for each level of allowed phosphorus loading in the wate rshed (the phosphorus constraint was parametrically varied). The results from th e linear programming runs are presented in the following section. Of particular interest for this policy was to observe how the possibility of land use change affects th e use of alum, the intensity of transportation within the watershed, average litter application rates for particular land uses, the level of abatement at the point source, and to compare the net income for the watershed as a whole to the policies that do not allow for land use change . These characteristics were observed as the allowed phosphorus loading for the whole wate rshed was varied from higher to lower levels. Policy 4 – Site Specific (Optimal) Land Use Conversion As opposed to the policy of uniform (mandatory) land use conversion, the last policy considered in this study was to simulate a site-specific (optimal) land use conversion. This was achieved by combini ng Policy 1 and Policy 3 in a single linear programming model. Separate production activities for each of the two policies were constructed in each HRU and were combined t ogether. For the part of the linear program pertaining to Policy 1, the basic twenty-four litter management practices were assigned as possible production activities for each HRU. For the part of the linear program pertaining to Policy 3, the overgrazed pasture and row crop HRUs were first converted to maintained pasture and hay HRUs resp ectively and the basic twenty-four litter

--- Page 134 ---
93management practices were assigned to each HRU in the watershed. Each production activity for each HRU was specifically labeled to di stinguish between alternative policies. The linear program was run to maximi ze the sum of the net income from agricultural activities in the watershed minus the abatement cost at the point source and the litter transportation costs, by choosing whethe r to convert a particular HRU, and then by choosing one of the twenty-four basic litte r management practices for each HRU, and by choosing a level of phosphorus abatement at the point source. The linear programming model was run for each level of allowed phosphor us loading in the watershed. Results from the linear programming runs are presente d in the following section. Of particular interest for this policy was to observe the op timality of land use change, the use of alum by land uses, average litter application rates by land uses, the level of abatement at the point source and to compare the net income fo r the watershed as a whole to the individual policies discussed above. It is to be expected that since this policy contains two of the above policies, it is least restrictive and he nce should yield the higher value of the net income for the watershed as a whole. Tracing the Total and Marginal Abatement Cost Curve For each of the four polic ies analyzed in the study for which linear programs were run, the total and marginal abatement costs were determined. Total abatement cost were determined as a difference in the value of the objective function of the linear program under the estimated current level of phosphorus loading (46000 kg./year) and the value of the objective function at each other level of phosphorus loading for which a linear program was run (for example, value of th e objective function at the allowed phosphorus loading of 46000 kg./year minus the value of the objective function at the allowed

--- Page 135 ---
94phosphorus loading of 30000 kg./year represents total cost of abating 16000 kg./year of phosphorus loading in the watershed using for example, Policy 1.). Marginal abatement costs were determ ined using the shadow price on the phosphorus constraint from the linear progr am (Eq.2.14.6). In the linear programming framework (Beneke and Winterboer, 1973) (Hazel and Norton, 1986) each binding constraint has an associated shadow pri ce (Lagrangian multiplier). The shadow price states the amount by which the value of the objective function changes as the constraint in question is relaxed (or constrained furthe r) by an additional unit. The interpretation in the sense of a Lagrange multiplier is that the shadow price states the value of a partial derivative of the objective func tion with respect to the constraining variable. Thus the shadow price on phosphorus loading in the linear program represents the change in the value of the objective function as that cons traint is changed by one more unit. This corresponds exactly to the definition of the marginal abatement costs discussed before. Therefore, the shadow prices on phosphorus, wh ich are obtained as output from the linear programming runs, are used to represent the marginal abatement costs. The marginal abatement cost curve is traced out by formulating a mathematical function that maps from the set of observed levels of phosphorus lo ading to the set of the observed marginal costs. A quadratic function was specified and the quadratic term was tested for significance (using Wald or Likelihood Ratio type statistical tests) to determine whether the appropriate function is quadratic or linear. Spatial Detail of Optimal Solutions In addition to the aspects that are of interest when examining individual policies described above, there is interest to obser ve the spatial characteristics of the HRUs,

--- Page 136 ---
95classifying them by optimal litter management practices assigned by the mathematical program. The spatial characteristics of the HRUs are mainly composed of soil type, slope steepness and geographic location (sub-basin). Fo r example, it is of interest to observe what are the spatial characteristics of HRUs that were assigned alum treated litter by the linear program runs, and it is of interest to observe the spatial characteristics of the HRUs where conversion of say row crop to hay wa s found optimal by the linear program runs. Also, in the linear programming framewor k, since each HRU has to be assigned a specific litter management practice (constraint represented in Eq. 2.14.2), there was a shadow price on each HRU. This shadow price essentially represents the value that would be added to the objective function if a sp ecific HRU was duplicated and added to the watershed. In other words, the shadow price is the marginal value that the agricultural area represented by an HRU adds to the ove rall objective function. The shadow price reflects both the economic and environmental value of an HRU. If the agricultural production in an HRU is profitable, its sha dow price would be hi gh and vice versa. On the other hand if the phosphorus runoff from an HRU is high its sha dow price would be low (even negative), reflecting the high margin al contribution of that HRU towards the fulfillment of the binding constraint on phosphorus loading. The spatial distributions of optimal litte r management practices have important policy implications. They provide guidelines for more effective regulation and management. Therefore a summary of the spa tial characteristics of HRUs by land use and chosen management practice is provided in the Appendix for the optimal solutions of each of the analyzed policies.

96RESULTS FROM THE ALTERNATIVE POLICIES Policy 1 – Changing Litter Management Practices The aggregate results obtained from the lin ear program runs for the base twenty- four litter management practices (change in litte r application rates, with and without alum amendments, with and without nitrogen replacement by commercial fertilizer) are presented in Table 2.5.

For example, the phosphorus load could be reduced from curre nt 46 tons/year to 30 tons/year (16 tons reduction) at total cost of about $230,000 distributed to agricultural enterprises ($100,000) and to the point source ($130,000). However, any further reduction comes at excessively high costs, characterized by the dramatically increasing marginal abatement cost at lower levels of phosphorus loading. The burden of this drastic phosphorus load reduction is almost exclusively on the agricultural enterprises, since the maximum reduction at the point source has already been achieved.

97To determine the socially optimal level of phosphorus abatement in the watershed using Policy 1, a summary of costs to the City of Tulsa and losses of recreational values, as well as the abatement costs for the various levels of phosphorus loading is provided in Table 2.6. The optimal level of abatement is indicated in the rightmost column of Table 6 at the point where the sum of abatemen t plus damage costs is at minimum (See Eq.2.5). Table 2.6.

At the exact optimal point, the marginal abatemen t costs will be equal to marginal damage costs (Eq.2.6). As discussed above, the marginal abatement cost curve is traced out by formulating a quadratic function, which in this case was of the form (t-values in parenthesis) (2.15) MAC 1 = 300.72 – 0.01422 Zmax k + 0.000000173 Zmax k2.

Results for the alum use and the average litter application rates for the HRUs, as well as the intensity of transportation and the level of abatement at the point source are observed for the linear program runs under the current phosphorus loading (46000 kg./year), under the optimal phosphorus loading (26000 kg./year) and under the minimum attainable phosphorus loading (20000 kg./year). These levels of phosphorus loading were chosen, so that the changes in optim al uses could be observed as the allowed phosphorus loading is reduced from higher to lower levels.

--- Page 140 ---
99 Results on the optimal litter application rates and the optimal decision on nitrogen replacement for hay and well-maintained pasture are reported for the three levels of phosphorus loading in Table 2.7. The results show that at the current level of phosphorus loading, application of litter would be more profitable for hay than for well-maintained pasture. As the allowed phosphorus loading is reduced, the amount of litter applied is reduced and the use of commercial nitrogen is increased. It was found more efficient to replace nitrogen on hay than on pasture. Table 2.7.

However, since these two land

--- Page 141 ---
100uses were identified as most susceptib le to phosphorus runoff, the optimal litter application rates are reduced as the allowe d phosphorus loading is reduced. As this is taking place, nitrogen is substituted from co mmercial sources to ensure good land cover, which reduces phosphorus runoff. This does take a toll on the net agricultural income, which is reflected in the low income at lower allowed levels of phosphorus loading. Table 2.8.

The results show that the use of alum is quite important as an optimal solution for hay.

For the well-maintained pasture, the optimal use of alum increases significantly as the allowed level of phosphorus loading is reduced. Results on the use of alum for overgrazed pasture (OPAS) and row crop (WWHT) are reported for the three levels of phosphorus loading in Table 2.10. The results show that the alum use is important optimal soluti on for these two land uses as well, especially at higher rates of litter application. Howe ver, as the allowed phosphorus loading is reduced, the application of litter is halted on most land and hence the alum is not used as well. At the 20 tones P loadi ng constraint, there is very little opportunity to apply litter and since litter had to be shipped out of the watershed, treating litter with alum was not optimal (it is cheaper to ship non-treated litter out of the watershed).

The results show that transportation of litte r within the watershed is very important activity if the net income on the watershed level is to be maximized. The optimal level of litter transportation intensified as the allowed phosphorus loading was restricted. At the 46 t. and 26 t. levels of phosphorus loading, it was not optimal to ship litter out of the watershed. However, if greater reducti on in phosphorus loading was desired, considerable amount of litter had to be shippe d out of the watershed and at considerable

--- Page 144 ---
103distance. This is one of the most signifi cant reasons for the dramatic increase of abatement costs (reduction of net income) at lower levels of phosphorus loading. The results also show that it is optimal to us e alum treated litter to efficiently prevent phosphorus loading. At the optimal solution, almost all litter used in the watershed is treated with alum. At lower phosphorus loadi ng levels, since the litter is shipped out of the watershed, the use of alum is lower than at the optimal rate. The summary of optimal litter application rates by average slope of the agricultural land for hay and maintained pasture is provided below in Table 2.12 while the summary of for overgrazed pasture and row crop is provided in Table 2.13. The results show that in general, applying litte r on land with steeper slopes is not optimal, especially if a reduction of P loading is de sired. This general finding however, needs to be addressed carefully since there is significant interaction between the slope of a land area, the crop grown, and the initial phosphorus content in the soil. Therefore, these interactions have to be taken into account when devising policies to reduce phosphorus loading in the watershed. The results for the optimal litter application rate with respect to soil types, for hay are presented in Table 2.14. The results coul d be used to identify the areas within soil types for where litter could be applied on hay la nd at six tons per hectare even for drastic reductions of the phosphorus loading target. T hose soils are Doniphan, Newtonia, Razort and Tonti. The results could be also used to identify the soil types for which litter application on hay land use was not found optim al as the target P loading was reduced. These soils are Captina, Nixa, and Macedonia.

For the overgrazed pasture however, the opposite conclusion holds true. The reason for this is the fact that on overgrazed pasture, the litter application on this soil type has be neficial effect on the improvement of land cover, which significantly reduces phosphorus runoff. The results for the optimal litter application rate with respect to soil types, for the row crop are presented in Table 2.17. The re sults show that litter application was optimal on two soil types for moderate reduction of phosphorus loading target. These soil types were Nixa and Tonti. For the row crop, the litter application was not found optimal on any soil at more drastic reductions of phosphorus loading.

109Policy 2 – Applying Litter According to the STP Criterion STP Threshold of 120 The results were obtained from the linear programming runs for four levels of the STP threshold values, 120, 200, 250 and 350. For the policy that allowed litter application only to the soils that have STP lower than 120, the model calculated a value of the objective function of $3.38 million, which represents the value of the net agricultural income minus the abatement cost s at the point source and the transportation costs Simulated phosphorus loading under the policy was 43367 kg./year. This represented a 2600 kg. reduction from the current estimated phosphorus load of 46000 kg./year. But, in comparison to Policy 1 described above, this reduction comes at extremely high cost. The average cost of phosphorus abatement was calculated as $877/kg (the value of the objective function fo r the current load (46 t.) is $5.61 mill., subtracting $3.38 million and dividing by 2600 (reduced P) one obtains $877). The main effect on the increased cost of abatement can be attributed to transportation of litter inside and outside the watershed. The intensity of transportation within the watershed is calculated at 1,218 thousand ton miles, while th e intensity of trans porting litter out of the watershed is 1,270 thousand ton miles This intensity of transportation is much higher than that calculated for Policy 1 (Table 2.11). Despite of being quite expensive, the po licy to apply litter according to STP is not very effective in reducing P loading. The r eason for this is that the litter is applied non- discriminatory with respect to phosphorus r unoff from particular land areas. The linear 8 As noted before, full abatement at the point source was assumed to be instituted with this policy. 9 Ton mile is defined as the quantity of one metric ton of litter shipped at the distance of one mile.

--- Page 151 ---
110programming model chooses liter application rates according to the criteria that would minimize transportation costs within and out of the watershed. Litter would be applied on a particular HRU if the cost of transporting the litter to that HRU were less than the cost of transporting that quantity of litter out of the watershed. Another important contribution toward excessive phosphorus runoff is that n itrogen that would normally come from litter is not replaced with commercial fertilizer, on ce litter application is not allowed. This results in poor plant growth that reduces the quality of land cover and increases phosphorus runoff. Also, this study allowed for the use of relatively high litter application rates. In the case of STP based policy, applying litter at these high rates causes high phosphorus runoff. Results on litter applicati on rates and the replacement of nitrogen with commercial fertilizer are shown in Table 2. 18. The results show that a great majority of the land areas where litter application was a llowed (where the initial soil test is below the threshold), received high litter application ra tes. On a significant portion of this land, litter is just applied to avoid shipping it out of the watershed. Table 2.18. Litter Application Rates and Nitrogen Replacement by Land Uses for the Policy that Restricts Litter Application only to Soils with STP < 120. Litter application rates for hay and well-maintained pasture were classified as follows: Low: 0-2 t./ha, Medium: 2- 4 t./ha, High: 4-6 t/ha. Litter application rates for overgrazed pasture were classified: Low: 0- 1 t./ha, Medium: 1.1- 1.8 t./ha, High: 1.8-3.2 t/ha.

111In addition, on the land where litter applica tion was not allowed, if nitrogen is not supplied from commercial fertilizer, the land cover is poor and there is greater potential for phosphorus runoff. This was especially a pparent with the overgrazed pasture and row crop. Table 2.19. reports the average phosphorus runoff rates when no nitrogen is applied to the land for the four agricultural land uses. Table 2.19. Average Phosphorus Runoff from Agricultural Land Uses if no Nitrogen is Applied. Land Uses Hay Overgrazed Past. Well Maint. Past Row Crop Phosphorus runoff (Total P, kg/ha/year) 0.279 2.022 0.138 4.962 As it is apparent from the table, the row crop and overgrazed pasture have extremely high phosphorus runoff rates when nitrogen is not substituted with commercial fertilizer. Since it is not economical to replace nitrogen fr om litter with more expensive commercial nitrogen, plant cover is poor, and phosphorus r unoff is not reduced as much as expected, which altogether results in reduced effectiveness of the STP based policies. Table 2.20. presents the results for litter application rates and replacement of nitrogen with commercial fertilizer by soil type s aggregated across agricultural land uses (litter application rates classified as descri bed previously in Table 2.18.) The results by soil types do not show any significant pattern by which one could isolate particular soil types with respect to litter application rates or with respect to nitrogen replacement. For the STP based policy, the litter application rates are governed by the spatial location of the HRUs (HRUs to which it is less expe nsive to transport litter receive high litter application rates). On the other hand, the determination whether to replace for nitrogen with commercial fertilizer or not is comple tely dominated by the grown crop relative to soil type (nitrogen is replaced where it is profitable, mainly on hay and row crops).

Table 2.21. presents the results for litter application rates and replacement of nitrogen with commercial fertilizer by land slopes aggregated across agricultural land uses. Inspection of the results presented in Table 2.21, reveals another reason for high phosphorus loading when using the STP based po licy.

113considerable amounts of litter would be applie d even on relatively steep slopes to save on costs to transport litter from the watershed. Since a majority of the land with steeper slopes is very susceptible to phosphorus runo ff, litter application on that land leads to excessive phosphorus loading in the watershed. Also, it is very likely that the land with steeper slopes would have lower STP because it did not receive as much litter as less steep land due to difficulties with application. So, a policy based on STP would indirectly create perverse incentives to apply litter to land that would otherwise remain without litter and would retain its low STP. Other STP thresholds – 200, 250, 350 The level of 120 STP is often cited as a maximum level above which all litter application to the agricultural land has to be stopped, and hence the STP based policy towards reduction of phosphorus loading in the watershed would likely employ this threshold value. Nevertheless, an analysis was conducted for other values of the STP threshold to explore the effects of varying the STP threshold level on the use of litter, transportation of litter, net income and phosphor us loading. The analyzed STP thresholds were 200, 250, and 350. Table 2.22. presents a summary of the levels of income, phosphorus loading and transportation of litter for the three STP threshold levels. The table shows that as the threshold value for STP is raised, effectively increasing the land area where litter application is eligible, net income on the watershed level increases as well 10 Net income on the watershed level is composed of net income to the agricultural enterprises, minus cost of abatement at the point source (it is assumed that the point source performs full abatement under this policy) and minus the cost of litter transportation.

Phosphorus loading increases at higher levels of STP thresholds (because of high litter application rates applied) but also tends to level off. For all STP threshold levels no alum treated litter is used, reflecting the absence of the phosphorus constraint in the linear program. Table 2.23. presents the results by litter application rates and whether or not nitrogen is replaced with commercial fertilizer aggregated over the agricultural land uses (litter application rates classified as described previously in Table 2.18.), for the levels of STP at 200, 250 and 350. The results in Table 2.23 show why the total phosphorus loading tends to level off at higher values of the STP threshold (57.4 t./year at STP 350, 2t./year at STP 250). At hi gh STP threshold the restrictions on land are significantly smaller, causing the change in the use of litter. With a low STP threshold, litter is a liability since its land application is very restri cted and it has to be transported out of the watershed. Litter is “dumped” using high application rates at any land

As the STP threshold increases, more land is available for litter application and the litter becomes a more valuable resource. Application rates now reflect the value of the marginal product of litter. In general, results obtained from the analysis of STP based litter application policy suggest that this “command and control” policy is neither effective nor economically efficient in reducing phosphorus loading in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed. Policy 3 – Mandatory (Uniform) Land Use Change The results obtained from the linear progr amming runs for a simulated policy of a mandatory land use change are provided in Tabl e 2.24. The results show that this policy may be very effective in preventing phosphorus runoff. The value of the objective function at the maximum phosphorus loading level is just slightly lower than the values observed under Policy 1 in Table 2.5. However at this level, the phosphorus constraint is not binding. This means that is a policy of mandatory land use change alone would reduce phosphorus loading to 31,000 kg. pe r year of which 20,000 kg comes from agricultural sources.

In the linear progr am, further reductions were simulated by parametrically varying the phosphorus constraint. The optimal level of phosphorus abatement can be found by looking for the minimum of the sum of abatement and damage costs. The optimal solution is obtained by equating marginal abatement costs to margin al damage costs. The marginal abatement costs for this policy can be expressed as a function of the phosphorus load by (2.16) MAC 3 = 25.165 – 0.0006 Zmax k. Solving simultaneously for phosphorus loading using the marginal abatement costs and marginal damage costs (Eq.2.13) one obtains the value of 23637, which is the socially optimal level of phosphorus load in kilogr ams per year under the mandatory policy of land use change. At this level, the entire phosphorus abatement is done by the agricultural sources, with no abatement at the point sour ce. Figure 2.12., graphically represents the marginal abatement and damage costs and the point of optimal phosphorus loading.

Table 2.25. presents the litter application rates for the three different levels of allowed phosphorus loading on the watershed level and by the two land uses (hay and well-maintained pasture) under the policy of mandatory land use conversion. The results show that higher litter application rates ar e used more on hay relative to the well- maintained pasture. This happens because fo r pasture the manure is deposited back on the land while with hay, more nutrients are removed from the land. The results do not suggest any significant changes in the litter application rates as the allowed phosphorus loading is reduced. It appears that most im portant for the reduction of phosphorus loading is land conversion itself, especially conve rsion from overgrazed to well-maintained pasture. The initial difference between overgr azed and well-maintained pasture is in two main aspects, the quantity of nutrients (nitroge n) that is applied and the stocking rates of cattle allowed to graze. The overgrazed past ure receives lower quantity of nitrogen and has a higher stocking rate than the well-maintained pasture.

This implies that reduction of stocking rates on the current overgrazed pasture in the watershed would pot entially provide quite significant reduction of phosphorus loading. Another observation that could be made from Table 2.25. is that production of hay is likely to be increased if the reduc tion of phosphorus loading is desired. Higher

--- Page 160 ---
119litter application on hay would result in greater hay production. On one hand, this would bring excess supply of hay in the region and likely cause its price to fall, while on the other hand baled hay may be most efficient wa y of exporting some of the nutrients out of the watershed that initially enter through th e purchased poultry feed, which is then transformed into litter. The results on the use of alum under the policy of mandated land use change is presented in Table 2.26. The results show th at alum use would be required in order to reduce the phosphorous loading at the watershed level even if mandatory land use change were instituted. Table 2.26.

The reduction in total quantity of alum treated litter at the minimum phosphorus loading comes about because of the reduced per hectare litter application rates for hay. Results on the alum use by particular so il types for both hay and well-maintained pasture are presented in Table 2.27. Presente d results could be used to identify soil types where alum use is more pronounced.

Alum use was not found very intensive on th e Razort, Stigler, Noark and Doniphan soil types. These results refer only to policy of mandated land use change. The optimal level of transportation of litter within the watershed is fairly stable across the three levels of required phosphorus loading ranging from 610 to 640 thousand ton miles. Export of litter outside the watershed was not required to meet the optimal phosphorus target of 23.6 metric tons per year. In general, the policy of mandatory land use change is economically efficient in reducing phosphorus loading in the watershed. However, the mandate for land conversion it imposes on the landowners makes it very difficult to implement in practice.

121Policy 4 – Site Specific (Optimal) Land Use Change The results obtained from the linear programming runs for the simulated policy of a site-specific land use change are presented in Table 2.28. The results show that a Table2.28. Results from the Linear Program Runs for the Simulated Site Specific Land Use Change Policy.

For example, the phosphorus load could be reduced from cu rrent 46 tons/year to 30 tons/year at total cost of about $100,000 through a combination of revised litter management practices including alum and land use changes. Furthe r reductions from bot h point and non-point sources could reduce total loading to 18 tons per year for an annual abatement cost of approximately $380,000 per year. The results s uggest that allowing for site-specific land use changes would be a very effective and economically efficient way to reduce phosphorus loading in the watershed. In the sa me time this policy is more efficient than the policy with uniform land use change, whic h can be detected by comparing the values of the objective function for the two policies at all levels of phosphorus loading.

--- Page 163 ---
122The socially optimal level of phosphorus loading using the policy of site-specific land conversion is found at the minimum of th e sum of abatement and damage costs. The exact optimal solution is obtained by equati ng marginal abatement costs to marginal damage costs. The marginal abatement cost s for this policy can be expressed as a function of the phosphorus load by (2.17) MAC 4 = 27.357 – 0.00054 Zmax k. Solving simultaneously for phosphorus load using the marginal abatement cost and marginal damage (Eq. 2.13) costs one obtains the value of 24526, which is the socially optimal level of phosphorus load in kilograms per year under the policy of site specific (optimal) land use change. At this level, costs of agricultural abatement activities are around $165,000, while the costs at the point source are about $33,000. The point source would abate about 2.3 metric tons of phosphorus annually. Figure 2.13, graphically presents the marginal abatement and damage costs and the point of optimal phosphorus loading obtained by equating them. y = -0.00054x + 27.357 R2 = 0.9861 y = 0.0003x - 59.9330102030405060708090 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50P load (t./year)Costs ($)Marginal Abatement Cost Marginal Damage Cost Linear (MarginalAbatement Cost) Linear (MarginalDamage Cost) Figure 2.14.

123This policy allows for analysis of th e optimality of land use conversion from overgrazed to well-maintained pasture and from row crop to hay. Table 2.29. presents the results on the optimal land area converted for the three levels of allowed phosphorus loading (maximum 46t./ha ; optimum 24.5 t/ha ; and minimum 18 t./ha). Table 2.29.

Overgrazed Pasture 6537 5 6537 5 4725 1816 Row Crop 385 2240 1106 1519 1792 834 The results presented in Table 2.29 show that the conversion of overgrazed pasture plays a more important role in re ducing phosphorus loading than conversion of row crop. At the optimal phosphorus loadi ng, virtually all overgrazed pasture is converted while only about forty percent of the row crop is converted. It is interesting to note that as allowed phosphorus loading is further restricted to 18 tons per year, the amount of overgrazed pasture land not converted actually increases, while more of the of row crop land is converted to hay. This is explained by looking at the Table 2.30. which presents results on optimal litter application rate s. The results in Table 2.30 show that at the maximum and optimum phosphorus loadings, the overgrazed pasture is converted to well-maintained pasture by essentially reduc ing the cattle stocking rates. If further reduction of phosphorus load is required, then the conversion of overgrazed pasture to well-maintained pasture requires increased fe rtilization in addition to reduced stocking rates. Results with respect to optimal litter application rates for the other land uses are similar to those observed for previously discussed policies.

For overgrazed pasture, low: 0-1.1 t./ha, medium: 1.1- 1.8 t./ha, high: 1.8-3.2 t/ha., for row crop. low: 0- 0.65 t./ha, medium: 0.65- 1.3 t./ha, high: 1.3-2 t/ha. It is important to observe alum use as the total maximum phosphorus targets are varied for this simulated policy. The results are presented in the Table 2.31. Alum use increases as the allowed phosphorus loading is reduced. Alum use is also greater with higher litter application rates. At the optimal level of phosphorus loading, most of the hay crop is fertilized with alum treated litter. The total quantity of alum treated litter used was only 508 tons for the current phosphorus loading (46 t.), but 64.2 thousand tons for the optimal phosphorus load ing (24.5 t.), and would increase to 74.1 thousand tons for the minimum phosphorus loading (18 t.).

The change in the amount of litter transpor t varies less dramatically as the total phosphorus limit is lowered. The litter transpor t within the watershed was calculated at 605 thousand ton miles for the current phosphorus loading (46 t.), 658 thousand ton miles for the optimal phosphorus loading (24.5 t.), and 673 thousand ton miles for the minimum phosphorus loading (18 t.). The optimal land conversion of overgrazed pasture to well-maintained pasture and from row crops to hay is summarized by in Ta bles 2.32. and 2.33. Essentially all of the overgrazed pasture would be converted to well-maintained pasture at the optimal

126phosphorus loading level (24.5t.). At the mi nimum phosphorus loading level, the soils where conversion was found not optimal (the pasture becomes more heavily fertilized) were Tonti, Taloka and Nixa. For the conversion of the row crop to hay, it appeared optimal to conduct conversion on the soil t ypes Macedonia, Doniphan, and Captina under both levels of allowed phosphorus loading. The analysis of optimal land use changes by land slope was also an important aspect to investigate. Results for the changes in land use by slopes for the optimal (24.5t.) and minimum (18 t.) phosphorus load level ar e presented for the overgrazed pasture and row crop in the following Table 2.34 Table 2.32.

128As expected, the results show that it is optimal to convert more of the land with steeper slopes than land with less slope. Howe ver this tendency cannot be generalized. Even at very low phosphorus loading levels, there are some areas with slopes in excess of eight percent which are not converted. For example, overgrazed pasture may be heavily fertilized with commercial nitrogen. This re sult may not hold if nitrogen runoff were also a concern. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION The economic analysis conducted within th is project attempted to assess cost effective technologies and policies for managing phosphorus pollution from both non- point sources and the point source in the Euch a-Spavinaw watershed. The analysis used the approach of minimizing the sum of abatemen t and damage costs to derive the socially optimal pattern and method of phosphorus abatem ent in the watershed. The perspective was that of a watershed manager. All costs and benefits were internalized in the optimal solutions presented. The preferences of th e society, translated directly into the preferences of a hypothetical watershed manager were expressed in a form of social well- being function. The optimal level of phos phorus abatement in the watershed would maximize this well-being function. The ma ximum point of the well-being function corresponds to the minimum of the sum of to tal abatement and damages costs and also corresponds to the point of equivalence be tween the marginal abatement and damage costs.

129The analysis of the abatement cost s was based on the costs of reducing phosphorus emissions from bot h point and the non-point sources of phosphorus loading in the watershed. Abatement costs at the poi nt source (the City of Decatur, AR) were determined using engineering data. For the non-point agricultural sources, a spatial bio- physical model (SWAT) was used to simula te phosphorus loading from each agricultural enterprise at each selected poultry litter ma nagement practice. Twenty-four poultry litter management practices were simulated. These consisted of various litter application rates with and without commercial nitrogen replacemen t for each of the major land uses in the watershed. The possibility to use litter amende d with ten percent aluminum sulfate was also considered. For each of these litter mana gement practices, net agricultural income was calculated using SWAT data, enterprise budgeting and price data. Environmental damage costs considered in this study included the cost of additional drinking water treatment for the City of Tulsa and the value of lost recreational visits to the lakes Eucha and Spavinaw. These costs were estimated using the observed data and were combined to calculate total da mage costs. This provides an estimate of the environmental damage costs. This study does not claim that all possible damage costs are accounted for. For example the cost of long te rm damages to the ecological values in the watershed were ignored. Nevertheless, the e nvironmental damage costs included in this study represent a significant part of the actual environmental damage cost from phosphorus loading in the Eucha-Spavinaw wate rshed, and therefore provide a relevant estimate of the damage costs. Marginal dama ge cost curve was calculated as a derivative from the total damage cost curve.

130Four policy simulations involving broiler litter management practices, land use changes, increased point source phosphorus abat ement that could be used to reduce the phosphorus loading in the Eucha-Spavinaw al ong with estimates of the environmental damages caused by phosphorus loads were presented. The first policy examined the potential of using only poultry litter management practices (including alum treated litter) and point source abatement. SWAT simula tions with twenty-four litter management practices for each land use-soil type comb ination (HRU) in the watershed were conducted. These results were included in a linear programming model and the least cost method of meeting phosphorus targets was de termined. These management practices were subsequently used in all simulated po licies. The second policy was that of limiting litter applications according to a soil test phosphorus (STP) criterion. The third policy considered mandatory conversion of overgrazed pasture to well-maintained pasture and of conversion of row crops to hay in the watershed. The fourth policy represented a combination of policies one and three excep t that land conversion was optional. With respect to the time frame the polices could be used in, the first policy would represent a short-run solution, second policy short to medi um run solution, while the last two policies would represent long run solutions. However all policies and analysis are short run with respect to phosphorus dynamics, because l ong-term phosphorus accumulation in soils beyond current levels was not considered. For each policy, a linear programming mode l was used to maximize net income at the watershed level (net income from agricu lture minus costs of abatement at the point source, minus litter transportation costs). Th e linear program for each policy was run for seven distinct levels of allowed phosphorus lo ading in the watershed. Marginal abatement

--- Page 172 ---
131costs were obtained as shadow prices on phosphorus loading from the linear program runs. They were than equated to the marginal damage costs to obtain a socially optimal level of phosphorus loading in the waters hed for each simulated policy. The linear programs were rerun for the determined optim al level of phosphorus loading, resulting in the optimal level of abatement at the point source and at each of the non-point sources. Since the non-point sources could be identified at considerable level of spatial detail, the results imply spatially optimal litter management practices for the agricultural enterprises in the watershed. Several conclusions could be derived from the results. First, from the determined optimal levels of phosphorus loading to th e lakes in the watershed under the various policies analyzed, it appears that a reasonabl e target for phosphorus loading could be set in a range of 23,000 to 26,000 kilograms per year. At these levels, costs for phosphorus abatement would not be excessively expensive especially in longer run. Further reductions in phosphorous loadings below these levels are attainable, but would be more costly to achieve, especially in the shor t-run. However, given the uncertainties and limitation of both the bio-physical model (SWAT) and the economic model, it is difficult to set an exact optimal level of allowed phosphorus loading in the watershed. Nevertheless, the predicted economically op timal phosphorus loadings from the social perspective are not far from the recommenda tions issued by Oklahoma Water Resources Board, (OWRB, 2002) Second, the use of the STP criterion alone to regulate the litter application and phosphorus loading in the watershed seems not to be a very effective and/or efficient policy. This policy was modeled as prev enting litter application on high STP soils

--- Page 173 ---
132regardless of soil type, land use, or the probability of phosphorus loss, and with no provisions for possibilities of chemical litter amendments (alum). In this form, the STP policy alone caused high losses of agricultura l income and increased the amount of litter hauled out of the watershed. The policy of this type created perverse incentives for applying litter at high application rates, indi scriminately where the STP level was below the limit just to avoid hauling it out of the watershed. Consequently, the model predicted litter would be applied to soils that were very susceptible to phosphorus runoff (steep slopes, erodable soils etc). Applying litter usi ng the Phosphorus Risk Index (Storm and Smolen, 2001) as a criterion instead of using STP, may improve the performance of this regulatory strategy. Research is currently under way to determine Phosphorus Indices for the soils in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed. Third, land use changes appear to be an important component of an efficient long- term solution to the problem of phosphorus pollution in the watershed. However, this would require more time and changes in th e economic structure of the agricultural production in the watershed. In particular, site-specific land use change, where a choice of which land should be converted is allowed is superior policy to the mandatory land use change. The results show that it would be op timal to convert the overgrazed pasture to well-maintained pasture almost in entirety, while it is optimal to convert only a part of the row crops to hay. Fourth, amending poultry litter with alum appears to be effective and efficient way of reducing phosphorus loading at the wate rshed level. The use of alum played a significant role in all optimal solutions for th e analyzed policies. The optimality of alum use is quite pronounced with high litter appli cation rates, implying that if higher litter

--- Page 174 ---
133application rates are used, a significant re duction of phosphorus runoff could be achieved if the litter is treated with alum. Fifth, the transportation of litter both w ithin and out of the watershed is a significant part of the optimal solutions for phosphorus loading reduction. It is important to note again that the economic analysis in this report was from a social perspective, or a perspective of a hypothetical watershed manager. From this perspective, the litter transportation costs are internal to the optimal decisions, and hence the transportation is a part of the optimal solutions. From a persp ective of an individual agricultural producer however, the transportation costs are bore privat ely. That is why an analysis from pure private perspective (ignoring the pollution) w ould result with different findings regarding the transportation of litter. However, any solution to the phosphorus loading in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed would require an an alysis that takes into consideration both social and private objectives and recommends policies where the discrepancies between the two would be minimized. Some of these policies are subsidizing transportation of litter and/or tax credit incentives. Sixth, significant phosphorus abatement at the point source would be optimal, especially in the short run. In the short-r un, the abatement at the point source could be achieved at lower cost than the abatement at the majority of agricultural enterprises (some agricultural enterprises would be able to abate even cheaper than the point source), and thus it is optimal to abate phosphorus a nd to drive the phosphorus concentration of the effluent from the point source to sligh tly higher than 1 mg/l. Even though in the long- run, using land use conversion, the abatement at the agricultural sources would be

--- Page 175 ---
134marginally less expensive than the abatement at the point source, the time frame and the urgency of the problem would require signi ficant abatement at the point source. Finally, and possibly most important, the methodology used in this study provides for assessing the optimal solutions at consider able level of spatial detail. For each unique agricultural land area (HRU) the study has assigned an optimal litter management practice for each simulated policy. The determined optimal litter management practices and policies could be applied on the site-sp ecific basis given the average land area of only 65 hectares for the agricultural HRUs. Th is would enable economic efficiency, as compared to use of rules and policies on th e uniform basis. The results on the spatial detail for the optimal solutions for each polic y are presented by HRUs in the Appendix. In addition, the spatial detail has been aggreg ated to derive results with respect to soil types and slope steepness. Using this aggrega tion, it may possible to draw some inference about the types of soils where litter applicati on should be first restricted, where alum use is most beneficial, or the slopes for which the conversion of land uses is most optimal. However, these are general inferences and by no means they apply uniformly to particular soil type or slope category. These aggregated results therefore may just provide general guidelines, but should not be used for policy formation when disaggregated results are available. Limitations of the economic modeling presen ted in this study stem from lack of data (environmental damages), modeling impe rfections (estimation, aggregation and averaging) and technical difficulties (ex. assessing the value of alum treated litter that is transported out of the watershed). Neverthe less, the study provides significant insights on the economics of phosphorus pollution in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed.
