Paso Post Office Should Honor Our Troops ATASCADERO, CA – Today, in response to the Paso Robles Post Office’s removal of pictures commemorating our troops bravely serving abroad, Congressman McCarthy issued the following statement: “Supporting our local heroes’ bravery and sacrifice is common sense. That is why I am troubled with the Paso Robles Post Office’s removal of pictures honoring the sacrifice of our brave men and women serving in the Armed Services. I am in contact with the Postal Service to get a clear answer of why this happened and determine what actions can be taken.” ### 1 / 1
