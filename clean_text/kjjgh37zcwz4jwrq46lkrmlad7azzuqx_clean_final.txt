1 Appeal from a judgment of the United States District 2 Court for the Western District of New York (Larimer, J .). 3 4 UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED 5 AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be 6 AFFIRMED . 7 8 Dawn Nguyen appeals from the judgment of the United 9 States District Court for the Western District of New York10 (Larimer, J .) convicting her of (i) making false statements 11 in connection with the acquisition of a firearm, (ii)12 disposing of a firearm to a convicted felon, and (iii)13 possessing firearms as a drug user. Nguyen was sentenced14 chiefly to 96 months’ imprisonment. Nguyen challenges the15 reasonableness of her sentence. We assume the parties’16 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural17 history, and the issues presented for review. 18 19 We review a sentence for procedural reasonableness 20 under a “deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.” Gall v.21 United States , 552 U.S. 38, 41 (2007). That means a 22 district court’s application of the Sentencing Guidelines is23 reviewed de novo and its factual findings are reviewed for 24 clear error. United States v. Cossey , 632 F.3d 82, 86 (2d 25 Cir. 2011). A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the26 district court “fails to calculate (or improperly27 calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines range, treats the28 Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the §29 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly30 erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the chosen31 sentence.” United States v. Aldeen , 792 F.3d 247, 251 (2d 32 Cir. 2015) (quoting United States v. Chu , 714 F.3d 742, 746 33 (2d Cir. 2013)). When a district court deviates from the34 Sentencing Guidelines range, “it must consider the extent of35 the deviation and ensure that the justification is36 sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the37 variance.” Id. at 252 (internal quotation marks and 38 citations omitted).39 40 Nguyen fails to establish that the district court 41 committed any procedural error. The district court42 appropriately weighed the factors laid out in § 3553(a) and43 reasonably determined that the Sentencing Guidelines did not44 sufficiently account for the severity of Nguyen’s conduct45 and culpability. See United States v. Gilmore , 599 F.3d 46 160, 169 (2d Cir. 2010). As a result, the district court47 2

considered whether an upward departure pursuant to §§ 5K2.11 (“death”) and 5K2.2 (“significant physical injury”) was2 necessary. Death and significant physical injury3 unquestionably resulted from Nguyen’s crimes. Coupling this4 fact with the finding that Nguyen acted “recklessly” in5 providing firearms to Spengler — whom she knew to be a6 mentally unstable, convicted violent felon who mused aloud7 about killing his sister — provided the district court with8 a sufficient basis to invoke an upward departure under §§9 5K2.1 and 5K2.2. See, e.g. , United States v. Aitchison , 411 10 Fed. App’x 358, 360-61 (2d Cir. 2011). 11 12 Contrary to Nguyen’s argument, the enhancements in §§ 13 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) and 2K2.1(c) do not mean that all of the14 circumstances of her offense were adequately taken into15 consideration in determining the guidelines range, such that16 departure was not warranted under §§ 5K2.1 and 5K2.2. The17 particulars of her offense, such as the multiple deaths and18 injuries that resulted (both deemed relevant under §§ 5K2.119 and 5K2.2), and the mayhem and massive property destruction,20 authorize departure beyond the § 2K2.1 enhancements, under21 the provisions of § 5K2.2223 Nguyen’s challenge to the district court’s factual 24 findings similarly fails. Based on the evidence presented25 in the pre-sentence report and at the sentencing hearing,26 the district court had a more than adequate basis for27 finding that (i) the firearm Spengler used to shoot the28 firefighters was one that Nguyen had provided him, and (ii)29 Nguyen believed Spengler to be “crazy.” 3031 Our review of the substantive reasonableness of a 32 sentence is “particularly deferential”: we will set aside33 sentences as substantively unreasonable “only in exceptional34 cases where the trial court’s decision cannot be located35 within the range of permissible decisions”; that is, where36 the sentence “shocks the conscience,” “constitutes a37 manifest injustice,” or “allowing [it] to stand would damage38 the administration of justice.” Aldeen , 792 F.3d at 255 39 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).40 41 The district court had sound reasons to deviate upward 42 from the Sentencing Guidelines range. Nguyen (i) knew that43 Spengler had previously been convicted of killing his44 grandmother with a hammer, (ii) knew that Spengler had45 voiced an intent to kill his sister, (iii) believed Spengler46 to be “crazy,” and (iv) lied to police about being a straw47 3

man purchaser for Spengler. Thus, Nguyen’s conduct falls1 well outside the heartland of straw man purchase cases. On2 this record, the district court’s sentence of 96 months’3 imprisonment is “within the range of permissible decisions.” 4 Id.5 6 Accordingly, and finding no merit in Nguyen’s other 7 arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district 8 court.9 10 FOR THE COURT: 11 CATHERINE O’HAGAN WOLFE, CLERK 121314 4
