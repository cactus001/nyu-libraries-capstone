A party that has taken testimony must serve on any adverse party a copy of the transcript of such testimony, together with copies of any exhibits introduced during the testimony, within thirty (30) days after the completion of the testimony deposition. See Trademark Rule 2.125. Briefs shall be filed in accordance with Trademark Rules 2.128(a) and (b). An oral hearing after briefing is not required but will be scheduled upon request of any party, as provided by Trademark Rule 129. If the parties to this proceeding are (or during the pendency of this proceeding become) parties in another Board proceeding or a civil action involving related marks or other issues of law or fact which overlap with this case, they shall notify the Board immediately, so that the Board can consider whether consolidation or suspension of proceedings is appropriate.
