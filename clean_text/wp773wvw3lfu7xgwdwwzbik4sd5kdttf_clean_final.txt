Jeremic Results & Analysis Science Potential Applications Computed tomography (CT) images of resin-impregnated MGM specimens (above), are assembled to provide 3-D volume renderings (below) of density patterns formedby diffused bifurcation under the external loading stress profile applied during theexperiments. Load and volume behavior of sand at 85% (F1) and65% (F2) relative density tested at 0.05 kPa.Increase in confining pressure results in a decrease in friction and dilatancy angles. Objectives Post-flight analyses Soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering Mining engineering Coastal and off-shore engineering Earthquake engineering Powder technology Terrestrial and planetary geology Erosion processes Off-road and planetary vehicle engineering Sand “volcano’’ caused by soil liquefaction Collapsed lunar crater slopes Sojourner rover on Mars• Laser profiles of the specimens at 5 deg. intervals. • Impregnate specimens with epoxy resin to stabilize internal fabric.• CT scans to map density and build 3-D models of interior.• Physically slice specimens and prepare thin sections for examination under optical microscope. • Digitize in-flight video images to map volume and shape changes vs. time. Test cells comprise sand specimens contained in a latex membrane (with a grid pattern for CCD cameras) between metal end platens and housed in a water-filled Lexan jacket. The test cells and experiment systemsare carried aboard the Space Shuttle.

June 10, 1998Nonlinear 3D finite element analysis was conducted on the specimen-membrane-end platen system (after B. Jeremic, “Fi-nite Deformation Hyperelasto-Plasticity ofGeomaterials.” Doctoral dissertation, Uni-versity of Colorado at Boulder, 1997). Thecorrespondence between the experi-ments and the analyses, using a consis-tent set of material parameters fromseparate experiments, show that the find-ings are reasonable and show internalconsistency.
