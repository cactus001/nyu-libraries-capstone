The target population was 111 teachers randomly selected by 20 teacher trainees teaching English in 20 schools within 6 school dist ricts in Kuwait. A mixed method of questionnaire and observation by the teacher trainees was used for data collection. The results showed a discrepancy between the questionnaire responses and personal observation. The questionnaire responses indicated that the teachers had sign ificant confidence, high competency, and excellent performance. However, classroom observation revealed that EF L teachers had to plan their classes with constraints of limited teaching hours and resources and mixed levels of proficiency and learning environment. Thus, Kuwaiti EFL teachers have the ability, proficiency, and confiden ce to teach EFL, but lack the re quired freedom from the educational authorities to implement their methods. Keywords: EFL teachers, instruction technique, teacher trainees, qu estionnaire, Kuwait Introduction 1 Study Background Traditionally, language teaching has been described in terms of what teachers do: that is, in terms of the actions and behaviors of teachers in the classr oom and the effects of these on learners (Rea & Mercuri, 2006). Richards and Lockhart (2007) as well as Nunan (1 999, 2005) mentioned that regardless of the class a teacher teaches, he or she is typically confronted with different kinds of tasks. For example, these tasks include observing students’ interactions, developing materials for the topic of the day, discussing reading materials, brainstorming for certain topics to write, problem solving, creating certain games to stimulate and assist students’ understandings, etc. In trying to understand how teachers deal with these tasks of teaching, it is necessary to examine the beliefs and thinking processes that underlie teacher s’ classroom actions through giving he r/his lessons (Krashen, 1998). Even though self-observation of the teachers would be the first step in c onsciously understanding one’s weaknesses, and followed by an action plan to address those weaknesses (Richards & Renandaya, 2008), with this study self observation was not carried out by teacher trainees to observe and evaluate themselves because many teachers never reflect on why they teach as they do. On the one hand, Richards also added th at self-observation gives the younger teachers who are in the first st age of their careers a far greater insigh t into their own teaching habits by emphasizing the effective ways of improving and understanding their own teaching; on the other hand, self observation is an unfamiliar process th at might create conflict in their person al and teaching values. However, by observing experienced teachers, teacher tr ainees know their current status with regard to teaching, and this helps them decide what they need to do to reach their goals. In addition, Pachier and Field (2001) expressed their concern that in order to be an eff ective foreign language teacher, the indi vidual needs a commitment to keep up with the recent developments in the field and a willingness to engage in continuous professional development. Therefore, observing experienced teachers would have mo re effect on newly graduate teachers than by any other means. 2 Research Motivation This study was motivated by the desire to provide useful information about the strategies of instructions carried out by the English language teachers inside the classroom in general and the teaching of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in Kuwaiti elementary school context specifically. Kuwaiti English education can be

--- Page 1 ---
www.ccsenet.org/ies International Edu cation Studies V ol. 5, No. 6; 2012 252 categorized as a true foreign language learning context rather than as an English as a Second Language (ESL) situation. That is, outside the classroom, English is rare ly used, and the classroom instruction is most likely the only input for the target language learning. Although the learners have 12 years of foreign language education starting from elementary stage till the end of high school, these learners r eceive limited target language input and have limited language learning time. B ecause of the large gap between what st udents are learning with regard to EFL and not ESL within the public schools in Kuwait, students show poor aca demic achievement at the university level especially when the medium of instruction and all the text books are in English in certain colleges such as the School of Engineer, Medical School, and the College of Art and Science (2011 English Department Statistics, at CBE). So, this level of academ ic achievement stems not from lack of intelligence but from the manner of exposure to the target language English. As a preliminary step toward improving Kuwaiti English education, the present study aims at exploring and describing the actual scenario in the English classrooms in Kuwait from the teacher trainees’ perspectives, because thes e young female teacher trainees are prospective future teachers and are in the first stage of their careers. They will be more open to certain professional critique, especially if this critique comes from experienced teachers who have been teaching for many years in this field. Furthermor e, teachers often work in isolation an d do not always have opportunities to benefit from the collective expertise of their colleagues. One way to avoid this is to build in opportunities for collaborative planning, for example, when teachers work together in pairs or groups on course planning, material development, and lesson planning. So, it is best to encourage teacher train ees to report their positive teaching experiences by examining how experienced teachers conduct their lesson in side the classroom. In addition, these teacher trainees are more ready to take risks by implem enting new ideas gained from observation and practice, in addition to those they learn theoretica lly. Therefore, as explained by Koks al (2011), letting these young teacher trainees observe, learn, and gain gu idance from experienced teachers w ould be more effective and acceptable than guidance from any other individu al as well as self observation. 3 Research Objectives This study attempts to answer the following questions: 1) What teaching techniques do teachers try to implement in their classroom? 2) To what extent is the teacher’s performance insi de the classroom similar to her response in the questionnaire? 3) What teaching resources do teachers make use of? and why? With regard to the above research questions, it could be said that it is essential for the teacher trainees who are in the first stage of their careers to show initial commitm ent and enthusiasm (Day, 1999). Koksal (2011), in his article on English Language Teachers wo rking in elementary schools in Turk ey, explained that their main goal was to improve the performance of teachers in Turkish schools, so they came up with training programs for young teachers, and renewed and shared the knowledge of experienced teachers. Therefore, it would be more effective if these teacher trai nees attentively watch their colleagues or e xperienced teachers so that they can get help and guidance and identify their ar eas of strength and weakness from th ese experienced teachers. If teachers are expected to teach well and develop their teaching skills and knowledge over time, they need ongoing support. This may take a number of forms. New teachers need a careful orientation to teachi ng assignments in order to clarify the goals of the program, teach ing approaches, resources, problems to anticipate, and their solutions. So, when teacher trainees connect with experienced teachers fo r mentoring and support as needed during their practicum period, they are encouraged to set higher goals and expend more personal effort, which in the end improves their self-confidence. 4 Literature Review For a long time in foreign/second language education, language has been viewed as an ‘object’ which is to be analyzed and broken down into its smallest components (Rea & Mercuri, 2006). According to Dornyei (2007), the teacher does not consider the students empty vessels that need to be filled with words of wisdom coming entirely from the teacher and the course book. Therefore, th e teacher’s role has been to help students learn what is in the textbook that is mostly grammar driven, and the study of foreign /second language teaching has been largely decontextualized and unrelated to students’ real life (Tedick & Walker, 1995). On the one hand, Phillips explained that both vocabulary and grammar need to be taught in context, and should be used by students in class (2010). On the other hand, Reyes and Vallone (2008) added that gaining knowledge of what is not dependent on the individual, but on social interaction an d culturally situated contexts can motivate students to use the target language and shape their communicati on competence. Morris (1995) observed that schools develop a culture, ethos, or environment that might be favorable or unfavorable to change and innovations. A

In contrast, a school where the principle focuses on administrative matters, the teacher s work in isolation or in narrow subject-based groups, and where there is no mechanism to discuss and try to solve problems is less likely to change. For example, if a school encourages innovation and successful implementation of foreign language teaching, the teachers might in troduce material from English-speaking culture s. This in turn is interesting to the students because the lives of children in foreign places give a more human face to the language they are learning. Based on Al Dabbous and Howells ex perience (1994) with English teach ing in Kuwait, EFL exams mainly concern structure in the target language that students fear and intensely dislike. They observed that the only way to acquire such knowledge is by extensive reading and listening. In language teaching history, the acquisition of linguistic structures or vocabulary has been emphasized for a long time, and it has been acknowledged that structures and vocabulary is important (Richards & Renandya, 2008). However, many researchers (e.g., Widdowson, 1995; Freeman, 1998) insisted that prepara tion for communication will be inadequate if only these are taught. That is, they argued that students might know the rules of language usage, but would be unable to use the language (Gebhard, 2005). Traditionally, language teachi ng has been explored in terms of what teachers do in the classroom, that is, the manner in which they carry out these tasks (Littlewood, 1992). It is, however, assumed that “what teachers do is a re flection of what they know and belie ve in, and that t eacher knowledge and ‘teacher thinking’ provide th e underlying framewor k or schema which guides the teacher’s classroom actions” (Richards & Lockhart, 2000). It is, therefore, requir ed to examine the thinking processes which underlie teachers’ classroom actions (Richards & Lockhart, 2007). Through his investigation of 105 EF L teachers’ practices about their language teaching, Johnson (1982) concluded that “teachers teach in accordance with their th eoretical beliefs and that differences in theoretical beliefs may result in differences in the nature of literacy instruction” (pp 101). Reyes and Vallone (2008) believe that a teacher is effective only if her students have access to a curriculum that cl osely mirrors their culture. Goldfus (2011) emphasized that foreig n language teachers must direct th e attention of the foreign language educators toward the acquisition of the literacy within the structure and components of not only the learner's native language but also the target la nguage. Also, Richards and Lockhart (2007) argued that “any language teaching program reflects both the cultu re of the institution as well as collective decisions and beliefs of individual teachers.... Within a program or school, teach ers’ views on such things as lesson planning, use of objectives, and assessment may lead to quite different classroom practices” (pp 38). Thompson (1992) noticed that “teachers interact with their environment, some experience no conflict between their beliefs and their practice, and some learn to live with unresolved conflicts” (pp 138). Howeve r, Edge (cited in Bailey, Curtis, & Nunan, 2001) states that working in isolation holds teachers back. Methodology 2.1 Participants and the Settings This study focused on 111 female Ku waiti EFL teachers who currently teach E nglish as a foreign language in 20 elementary public schools located in the 6 school distri cts in the State of Kuwait. These schools in Kuwait are segregated into all-girl and all-boy schools. Only female teachers teach both genders in these schools because the Ministry of Education (MOE) in the State of Kuwait stip ulates this gender segregation. Like all Kuwaiti public schools, these buildings are enclosed within a high, fortified stone and brick wall and have an unarmed guard at the single entrance, to protect the children from intruders or other harm. Even children who are late to school are stopped by the guard, and must receive approval from the principal before being allowe d to enter. The standard elementary school day schedule throughout Kuwait runs from 7:30 a.m. to 1:20 p.m., after which the children go home to lunch (children may bring snacks to eat during breaks). The children have seven 40-minute class periods over the course of the school day, broken by a 20-minute recess period after the second class, and by a 15-minute prayer period break after the fourth class. However, no t all academic subjects receive the same amount of time. Two of the daily 40-minute periods are devoted to Arabic reading and writing, and two more 40-minute periods each day are given to mathematics. Only one 40-minute period a day is sp ent on English. The remaining two daily periods are divided among several subjects: science (which is studied for three periods a week), Islamic religious studies (also studied for three periods each week), social science, physical e ducation, music, and art. All elementary public schools have between 10-15 teachers for different subjects and are trained to teach from 1-5 grades. For example, in each school selected for this study, there were 10-13 English language teachers who randomly teach students from grades 1-5 every year, ba sed on the school timetable and how the subjects are distributed throughout the day. That is, one English teacher teaches first, second, and fifth grade for a whole school year, whereas another one teaches third and fourth grade, and so on. Furthermore, children stay in a single

All teachers us e the curriculum prescribed in the textbooks which are given to all teachers and students around the country by the MOE. Also, according to the regulations of the MOE, all mainstream teachers have unexpected visits from the ministry supervisors and school principals for evaluation. Because the MOE and the College of Basic Education (CBE), a college that trains and graduates teachers mainly for primary levels, work clos ely together, the teacher trainees are assigned different schools for their practicum course. Furthermore, the 20 trainees enrolled in the practicum course had already completed a micro-teaching course, which is a core course the trainees have to pass before they graduate with a degree in teaching English as a foreign language from th e CBE. As soon as the practicum course starts with every semester in every school year, the CBE contacts the MOE to inform the mini stry about the number of students who will be enrolled in the practicum course. In return, the MOE will assign the schools where the practicum will be conducted. Then, the teacher trainees contact the assigned schools for their practicum. As soon as the teacher trainees arrive to these assigned schools, each of them has 2 weeks to observe mainstream teachers teach before she takes over one of the mainstream teachers' classrooms. The te acher trainee is just a non-participating observer and sits at the back of the classroom and observes the class without interfering in it. Before the beginning of the practicum course, I approached the school district authorities to get permission and official letters for the principals to guarantee access to the schools for the research. Furthermore, because the teacher trainees were observing the experienced teachers for their practicum , I approached the 10-13 experienced teachers in each school one week before the practicum started. I explained the scope of the study and got approval from at least 2-4 experienced teachers in each sc hool. Then, I approached the principals of these 20 schools and asked them to assign thes e experienced teachers who had agreed to fill out the questionnaire first and then the observation for the practicum course. 2 The Instrument A non-participant observation and a questionnaire were used for this study. The questionnaire was handed to the experienced teachers to be filled out by them before thei r class began. The same teacher trainee then observed the experienced classroom teachers and wr ote her comments in her journal. E ach trainee had a chance to observe 4–6 teachers per week in the assigned school (an average of 1 teacher per day) and report her observations to the author at the end of the day. The observation was carried out in the classrooms for the entire period of the class, i.e., 40 minutes. Based on the teacher trainees' journal, the author analyzed what was written and cross checked with other trainees. The researcher's questionnaire was guided by a checklist, developed by Christison and Bassano (1996), and used by the author as a guide for experienced teachers and teacher trainees self evaluation. 3 Data Analysis 3.1 Questionnaire To identify the differences between categories (learn ing environment, individuals, and activities) and the corresponding sub-categories in the teachers’ self-assessed performan ce, the overall score achieved by each teacher in each case was calculated by summing up the values of their responses. For example, a score of 9 in the sub-category ‘Relationship to Students’ was achieved if a teacher believed she had an excellent performance in all items within this subcategory (answers = 3 in all cas es). Next, scores were transformed into a proportion of the maximum possible score achieved; this enabled to compare categories with different numbers of questions. For example, in the sub-category ‘Relationship to Stud ents,’ the maximum possible score was 9. For a subject with a total score of 7 (two answers ‘excellent/3’ and one answer ‘improvement is needed/1’), the calculated proportion was 7/9 or approximately 0.77. The maximum possible score of individuals who did not respond to all questions or indicated that a question was ‘not a pplicable’ was adjusted accordingly. The author also conducted an exploratory analysis to examine potential associations betw een the scores in each category by using Spearman rank correlations. 3.2 Observation The instrument on which the observation was based included the same items as the questionnaire. To ensure the credibility of the teacher’s response to the questionnaire as well as to triangulate and assure the validity of the conclusions, the author requested the teacher trainees to observe the teacher as ma ny times as possible. The reason for using the same items on the questionnaire for the teacher trainees to follow in their observation is to allow for more rigorous comparison and contrast betw een the teacher’s response to the questionnaire and how she teaches her lesson inside the classroom. Based on exploration of Kuwaiti EFL t eachers’ classroom practices, teacher trainees found that teaching is a very personal activity, and it is not surprising that individual teachers brought to teaching very different beliefs and assumptions about what constitutes effective teaching. EFL teachers had their classes organized and the instructional even ts are structured to a large extent on the nature of

--- Page 4 ---
www.ccsenet.org/ies International Edu cation Studies V ol. 5, No. 6; 2012 255 the language that students hear and use in the classroom. Th e analysis classified two sets of characteristics that appeared to distinguish classes that work for language learning from those that do not. The first set relates to the way the classes are structured or are or ganized for instruction, the second to the way language is used in lessons (Richards, 1997). Class structure as observed by the te acher trainees that EFL lessons worked effectively, usually followed the following procedure: 1) A lesson began with a short statement of goals to be covered for the day and followed by a short review of the previous day. 2) New materials were presented in small steps with student practice after each step. 3) Instructions and explanations were given in a clear and detailed manner. 4) A high level of active practice was provided for all students. 5) Questions were asked and then checked for student understanding and eliciting of the responses. 6) Students were guided during initial practice. 7) Systematic feedback and corrections were provided. Explicit instruction and practice were provided for paired and group work exercises, and students were monitored during these work sessions. Furthermore, teachers mainly used tape or CD record er, where data storage devices and computers were not available to them. Authentic materials and learner-centered activities were not used as often. In some classes, the teacher trainees reported that 58.7% of the teachers rated their performan ce from the questionnaire as excellent and 27.5% as good when it comes to activities and materials; however, when the teacher trainees analyzed the classroom observation, they realized th at the teachers had no power to deve lop and implement new strategies for English teaching. The teachers acknowledged that these prob lems were fostered by the officials at the education ministry, who discouraged English teachers from exploring or using any materials other than the required textbooks and activity books. Interpretation of Results Responses were marked according to th e following scale: (3) Excellent, (2 ) Good, (1) Needs improvement, (0) Not applicable. All the data were transferred directly to SPSS for analysis. There are three main topics in the questionnaire, namely learning environment, individuals and activity, under which are various sub-categories. The first category to be reviewed is the learning environm ent. This category is divided into three sub-categories, namely the relationship to students, classroom, and presentation. In the second sub-category classroom, 2 questions were asked: are class arranged according to the class activity? And are materials and equipment needed for a class set up before the class begins? The third sub-category presentation consisted of seven questions, each of which focused on the teachers’ presen tation skill and performance. To obtain a general view in the presentation field, the mean was obtained from a ll the answers provided by the participants in the seven questions. The next category in the questionnaire is rela ted to individuality. This category consists of five subcategories, namely, physical health, self-concepts, ap titude and perception, reinforcement, and development. Each subcategory contains three to fi ve statements, each of which needs to be rated by the participants according to their performance. The final topic in the questionnaire is “the activity” category. Th is category consists of two sub-categories, namely “interaction” and “language.” The first one involves seven statements, which were answered by the participants in light of their teaching context. However, the la st five statements in the interaction subcategory are related to what the students are saying (content) rather than erro r correcting. In addition, teachers rated themselves high on how these activities are geared toward the outside world. Figure 1 shows that in all three categories, learning environment (relationship to students, classroom, presentation), individuals (physical h ealth, self concepts, aptitude & percep tion, reinforcement, development), and activity (interaction, language), most EFL teachers rated their teaching performance positively, as indicated by the fact that most answers were within the 'Excellent' an d 'Good' categories. Within learning environment, performance was especially high for question Q7, namely, their assessment of their voice volume in class (see Tables 1, 2, and 3 for the corresponding question codes and their description). The results also show that the area where teachers believe there is more room for improvemen t is how students are divided into groups and based on certain physical or may be cognitive features. However, te achers thought that their writing and speaking clearly was not applicable due to the fact that taped materials we re mainly used inside the classroom. In addition, within the same category (learning environm ent), most teachers thought they ha d an excellent presentation skills, whereas as the teacher trainee observed that the teac hers were almost never communicative in the exercises

There was very little freedom and lack of predictability in what teacher or students did or said. The teachers were in cont rol of the activities, and the students te nded to passively parrot the teacher’s English words or phrases. The stude nts did not ask questions, and the teachers’ recitation and discussion questions were narrow and drill-oriented and did not encourage anything besides parroting. Not only the students, but the teachers were also passive and restrictive in what they did. In the different classes around Kuwait, under teachers with different personalities an d ideas, the teacher trainees saw identical classes that resembled closed copies of each other. The same drills were held to give children experience saying the same material, followed by the same games or songs, using the same handouts, wall charts, flashcards, or tape recordings. After the students practiced a new item for a few times, th e teachers often assumed that the students had learned it and accelerated the pace of teaching in order to move to the next item on the agenda. The overriding goal of these teachers seemed to be the co mpletion of the step-by-step, class- by-class plan supplied by the MOE, regardless of whether they thought the students understood or were inte rested. Keeping p ace with the other teachers seemed to be the main priority of all the teachers. Although the majority of teacher participants have shown confidence in their performance and have rated it as excellent or good, for Questions 10 and 12, namely the target language ability, less than 2% felt that language activities that lead to proficiency level as well as the information gained inside the classroom links the students to the outside world spoke the truth based on the analysis of the data collected during the observation. Almost all the students were not exposed to native-speaker pronunc iation during the English class, and many of these teachers modeled several grammatical errors. The class ac tivities observed by the teacher trainees consisted of vocabulary drills, exercises, and games, almost entirely without translation, and the meanings of words were indicated contextually by pictures or gestures. The entire class would ch orus the answers first, and later, individual students would be ca lled on. The teacher trainees noticed that some students seemed more proficient and knowledgeable than others, and that classes often ended with some students still not seeming to understand the vocabulary. Students’ mistakes we re not corrected at once, but were ignored, to avoid their discouragement or humiliation; later, the teacher or anot her student would model the correct answer. Figure 2 confirms that self-assessment rating was highly positive and consistent across categories, as indicated by the observation of the graph, that in all cases scor es were close to the maximu m possible score within each category. However, most of the teach ers considered themselves as good within all the subcategories. The exploratory correlation analyses conducted (Figure 3) indicates a high degree of consistency in the answers to the questionnaire by each teacher. As shown in the figure, with the exception of the asso ciation between the scores of ‘Relationship to Students’ and ‘Language’ (not significant: NS in the graph), all correlations were significant. The strongest association (darkest square in Figure 3) was between the scores of the categories ‘Aptitude & Perception’ and ‘Reinforcement’. This result indicates that a strong positive correlation between the two variables. However, if we look at the same figure 3, the scores for self-concepts and the interaction and the development and language were very low compared to the other categories. However, based on the classrooms observations, the teachers showed lack of accuracy in terms of implementing the technique, such as active involvement in language use and student-centered ac tivities. Throughout the period of teacher trainees’ observation, not only novice teachers but more experi enced teachers also followed these lessons based on the teacher’s manual provided by the MOE, mostly with out any deviation, just like actors following a script. The teachers seemed convinced that they were required to do this by the MOE. Students’ competence and understanding often seemed to be irrelevant. Therefore, instruction tended to resemble “parrot learning,” in which many students made sounds without knowing why. The lessons in the manual are also fairly teacher-centere d, and became even more so because the teachers did not introduce pair work or small group work, although it is permitted by the manual. A teacher-centered approach is clearly necessary to some degree w ith novice students. But the manual do es not suggest, for instance, that students might ask for the English names of objects they bring to class or for the English names for Arabic words, a communicative activity that would have kept the students interested. Presum ably this is because such activities could have involved some translation (or perhaps becaus e the teachers might not always have known the English words).

Questions Answers 0 1 2 3 B Total Relationship with students 1. I establish good eye contact with my class. I do not talk over their heads, to the blackboard, or to just one individual. If I tend to teach predominan tly to one area of the classroom, I am aware of this. I make a conscious effort at all times to pay attention to all students equally. I divide my students into small groups in an organized and principled manner. I recognize that these groups should differ in size and composition, varying with the objective of the group activity. Classroom 4. I arrange the seating in my class to suit the class activity for the day. When I need special materials or equipment, I have them set up before the class begins. Presentation 6. My handwriting on the blackboard and charts is legible from all locations in the classroom. It is large enough to accommodate students with vision impairments. I speak loudly enough to be heard in all parts of the classroom and I enunciate clearly. I vary the exercises in class, alternating rapid and slow paced activities to keep up maximum interest level in the class. I am prepared to give a variety of explanations, models or descriptions, understanding that one explanation may not be sufficient for all students. I help the students form working principles and generalizations. I use new skills or concepts long enough so that they are retained and thus future application is possible. I plan for “thinking time” for my students so that they can organize their thoughts and plan wh at they are going to say or do. Note: Teachers were asked to thoughtfully consider eac h statement and rate themselves in the following way: (3) Excellent, (2) Good, (1) Needs improvement and (0) Not applicable. Column denoted as ‘B’ in the table represents the frequency of blank answers. The total represents the sum of valid (non-blank) responses.

Questions 0 1 2 3 B Total Physical Health 1. I know which students have visual or aural impairments and make them seat as close to my usua l teaching position as possible. I am aware that a student’s attention span varies from day to day depending on mental and physical health and external distractions. I pace my class activities to accommodate the strengths. I don’t continue with an activity which may exhaust or bore them. I begin my class with a simple activity to wake the students up and get them working together. I am sensitive to individual students who have bad days. I don’t press a student who is incapable of performing at the usual level. I try to challenge students who are at their best. If I am having a bad day and feel it might affect my normal teaching style, I let my students know so there is no misunderstanding about my feelings for them. Self-Concept 7. I treat my students with the same respect that I expect them to show me. I plan “one-centered” activities which give all students an opportunity at some point to feel important and accepted. I like to teach and have a good time teaching — on most days. Aptitude Perception 10. I am aware that my students l earn differently. Some students are visual-receptive, some are motor-r eceptive, and others are audio- receptive My exercises are varied, some are visual, aural, oral and kinesthetic. I provide models, examples, and experiences to maximize learning in each of these areas I know basic concepts in the memory process. When applicable, I make use of techniques such as backward buildup and association to aid students in rapid skill acquisition. Reinforcement 13. I tell students when they have done well, but I don’t let praise become mechanical. I finish my class period in a way which will review the new concepts presented during the class period. My students can immediately evaluate their unde rstanding of those concepts. My tests are well-planned and produced. I make’ my system of grading clea r to my students so that there are no misunderstandings of expectations. Development 17. I keep myself updated on new t echniques in the ESL profession by attending conferences and work shops and by reading pertinent professional articles and books. I realize that there is no one ri ght way to present any lesson. I try new ideas where and when they seem appropriate. I observe other EFL teachers so that I can get other ideas and compare them to my own teaching st yle. I want to have several ideas for teaching any one concept. Note: Teachers were asked to thoughtf ully consider each statemen t and rate themselves in the following way: (3) Excellent, (2) Good, (1) Needs improvement and (0) Not applicable. Column denoted as 'B' represents the frequency of blank answers. The total represents the sum of valid (non-blank) responses.

I organize the activities so that they are suitable for real-world interaction The activities maximize student involvement The activities promote spontaneity or experimentation on the part of the learner. The activities generally transfer atte ntion away from “self” and outward toward a “task . “ The activities are organi zed to insure a high su ccess rate, leaving enough room for error to make the activity challenging. I am not overly concerned with erro r correction. I concentrate on what my students are saying (content). Language 8. The activity is focused. The content or the skill presented will be easily transferable for use outside the class. The activity is geared to the proficiency level of my class or slightly beyond. The content of the activity is not too sophisticated for, my students. I make the content of the activity relevant and meaningful to my students’ world. Note: Teachers were asked to thoughtfu lly consider each statement and rate themselves in the following way: (3) Excellent, (2) Good, (1) needs Improvement, (0) Not applicable. Column denoted as 'B' represents the frequency of blank answers. The total represents the sum of valid (non-blank) responses. Conclusion One of our greatest challenges as we prepare teachers for the complexity of foreign language instruction is to continue to believe that we are preparing teachers to make change. Through the micro-teaching and the practicum courses, we stress the disparities between what we might want to see in classrooms and what they are actually experiencing in schools. Teacher trainees often re port with delight the opportunity to work alongside a true mentor (classroom teacher), a teacher with a belief that second language inst ruction is challenging but wonderful. In other wo rds, teacher trainees should take the initiative to work with colleagues for their own development; by this way, they can ga in an inside perspective on other teachers’ experiences and raise their awareness through reflecting on their own teaching. Generally speaking, most teachers seem to be confident as the data has show n that all the answers were mainly either excellent or good. Figure 1 su mmarizes the answers to th e research question (1-3). It indicates that the teachers have high level of performa nce in relation to the items on the questionnaire based on the three main categories: learning environment, in dividuals, and activity. It is worth co nsidering that a few teachers who participated in this research and chose the “not appli cable” answer were mostly those who not only felt it was irrelevant to teach English but also did not properly teach English in their classes. According to the note-taking during the observations, it is apparent that the teachers do not perform in the same way as stated in the questionnaire. The teachers felt that they had insufficient opportunities in which they could make mistakes without being judged; therefore, it was better for them to follow the syllabus and the teacher’s manual. They also experienced difficulty finding opportu nities to reflect upon their own performance and to identify and address the r eal needs of learners. Peer observation and reflection on own teaching are considered as importan t by teacher trainees because this helps them in search of learning and adapting to new teaching environment through observing their fellow peers and reflecting on their own teaching once they start this prof ession. In this study, all teachers rated themselves as

They gave themselves higher score regardless of the quality of their performance as was observed. Furthermore, teachers need ed to feel secure in EFL teaching environment. Consequently, they experienced anxiety and fr ustration. This frustration became apparent after the administration of the questionnaire. Thus, there should be a technique for comprehensive and objective self observation for teachers. Howe ver, because the questionnaire was used as against observation, the teacher did not feel a sense of security in EFL teaching environmen t. The findings indicate that the participants (teachers) conceptualized practice in concern with their beliefs ab out English learning, teaching, their teacher role, and unique context factors, but in reality, they were mere ly following the guidelines of the MOE of Kuwait. 1 Study Limitations One limitation of this study was the presence of the teac her trainee as an observer for the experienced teacher, which was awkward decision to follow. Second, the findin gs of this study cannot be generalized to the entire population of English teachers, because this study dealt only with elem entary school teachers. Finally, the study focused on Kuwaiti elementary school English teachers worki ng in public elementary sc hools. Information about teachers in private schools and about foreign t eachers were not included in this article. 2 Future Direction for the Research The Ministry of Education should relax its curriculum guide lines so that creative teachers feel free do their best teaching. The official curriculum has no t served as a framework of goals, within which the teachers may develop their own teaching styles, but instead has been functioning as a straitjacket, imposing unimaginative, curriculum-centered teaching. Instead of laying out lesson plans for the entire year, the teachers’ manual might set learning goals, and then offer a rich array of teaching techniques and materials for teachers to choose among in developing their own lesson plans.
