329DISCUSSION Thompson Basin - Trend Study No. 23-3 Study Information This study is located on a moderately steep slope above Thompson Basin [eleva tion: 6,880 feet (2,097 m), slope: 25%, aspect: northeast]. An area below the transect was chained approximately 25 years ago by the US Forest Service. A fire also burned through the area approximately 30 years ago. Thompson Basin has been noted historically as a concentration area for deer during the winter. A DWR pellet group transect, whichintersects the trend study, indicated a 5-year average of 32 deer days use/acre (80 ddu/ha) between 1980 and1985 (Jense et al. 1985). The 6-year average from 1986 to 1991 was 9 deer days use/acre (21 ddu/ha) (Jense etal. 1991). A pellet group transect sampled along the study baseline estimated deer use at 21 days use/acre (52 ddu/ha) in 1998, 26 days use/acre (65 ddu/ha) in 2003, a nd 20 days use/acre (50 ddu/ha) in 2008. Elk use was estimated at 12 days use/acre (30 edu/ha) in 1998, 9 da ys use/acre (23 edu/ha) in 2003, and 15 days use/acre (38 edu/ha) in 2008. Cattle use was estimated at 1 day use/acre (2 cdu/ha) in 2008. In the past, the area was heavily grazed by sheep, however, the Forest Servi ce has closed the area to livestock grazing to protect watershed values. Soil The soil is a sandy clay loam with a neutral reaction (pH 6.6). Relative combined vegetation and litter cover decreased from 62% in 1998 to 49% in 2003 and 2008, while relative combined rock and pavement cover remained rather stable at 31%-36%. Relative bare ground cover increased from 7% in 1998 to 19% by 2008. The erosion condition class was rated as stable in 2003 and moderate in 2008 due to surface rock, litter, and soil movement, as well as the formation of pedestals and fl ow patterns. There are a few large, active gullies on the hillside and in the valley. Browse Mountain big sagebrush ( Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana ) is the only abundant source of preferred browse, although true mountain mahogany ( Cercocarpus montanus ) and Mormon tea (Ephedra viridis ) are present in low densities. Sagebrush quadrat cover has remained stable at 4%-5% since 1998. Density decreased from 1,000 plants/acre in 1998 and 2003 to 840 plants/acre in 2008. Decadence has been high in all sample years at 30%-55% of the population. Young recruitment incr eased slightly from less than 10% of the population before 2003 to 14% in 2008. Plants displaying poor vigor increased from 0% of the population in 1985 to 32% in 1991, decreased to 10% in 1998, then increased to 29% by 2008. Browse use has been mostly light- moderate in all sample years. Annual leader growth averaged 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in 2003 and 0.7 inches (1.9 cm) in 2008. Pinyon pine ( Pinus edulis ) and Utah juniper ( Juniperus osteosperma ) combined canopy cover was 23% in 1998, 34% in 2003, and 27% in 2008. Point-centered quart er data estimated pinyon density at 72 trees/acre in 1998 and 63 trees/acre in 2003 and 2008. Average trunk diameter was 4.2 inches (10.7 cm) in 1998 and approximately 5 inches (12.7 cm) in 2003 and 2008. Juniper density was 99 trees/acre in 1998, 97 trees/acre in 2003, and 104 trees/acre in 2008. Trunk diameter averaged 9.9 inches (25.1 cm) in 1998, 8.4 inches (21.4cm) in 2003, and 9.6 inches (24.3 cm) in 2008. Herbaceous Understory Total grass cover was 12% in 1998, 6% in 2003, and 7% in 2008. Perennial grasses dominate the understory. Bluebunch wheatgrass ( Agropyron spicatum ), mutton bluegrass ( Poa fendleriana ), and Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda ) combined provided 94%-98% of the total grass cover since 1998. Bottlebrush squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix ) and Indian ricegrass ( Oryzopsis hymenoides ) were also present but less frequent. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum ) was sampled in less than 25% of the quadrats since 1998, and provided little cover.

330Forbs are sparse and provided 1%-3% cover since 1998. Desert phlox ( Phlox austromontana ) provided the majority of the forb cover. Longleaf phlox ( Phlox longifolia ), rockcress (Arabis sp.), and tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata ) were also relatively abundant. 1991 TREND ASSESSMENT The browse trend is slightly down. Sagebrush density decreased from 1,599 plants/acre to 1,466 plants/acre, and decadence increased from 33% of the population to 55%. Young recruitment remained stable at 9% of the population. Plants exhibiting poor vigor increased from 0% of the population to 32%. The trend for grass is up. The sum of nested frequency for perennial grasses increased substantially. Bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, mutton bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail increased si gnificantly in nested frequency. The trend for forbs is up. The sum of nested freque ncy for perennial forbs greatly increased. Desert phlox increased significantly in nested frequency. browse - slightly down (-1) grass - up (+2) forb - up (+2) 1998 TREND ASSESSMENT The browse trend is stable. Browse density changes ma y have been related to the larger sample area in 1998, therefore, the trend was determined using other para meters. Sagebrush decadence remained high, although it decreased from 55% of the population to 30%. Young recruitment decreased slightly from 9% of the population to 6%. Plants displaying poor vigor decreased from 32% of the population to 10%. The trend for grass is down. The sum of nested frequency for perennial grasses decreased 27%. Bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and bottlebrush s quirreltail decreased significantly in nested frequency. The trend for forbs is down. The sum of nested frequency for perennial forbs decreased 52%. Longleaf phlox decreased significantly in nested frequency. The winter range c ondition, determined by the Desirable Components Index (DCI), was rated as very poor due to low preferred browse and perennial forb cover, despite moderate perennial grass cover. winter range condition (DCI) - very poor (31) Mid-level potential scale browse - stable (0) grass - down (-2) forb - down (-2) 2003 TREND ASSESSMENT The browse trend is stable. Sagebrush density rema ined similar to 1998 at 1,000 plants/acre. However, decadence increased from 30% of the population to 42%. Young recruitment also slightly increased from 6%of the population to 10%. Plants displaying poor vi gor increased from 10% of the population to 24%. The trend for grass is slightly down. The sum of nest ed frequency for perennial grasses decreased 17%. Mutton bluegrass decreased significantly in nested frequency, and that for Sandberg bluegrass increased significantly. The trend for forbs is stable. The sum of nested frequency for perennial forbs increased slightly. The DCIrating remained very poor. winter range condition (DCI) - very poor (20) Mid-level potential scale browse - stable (0) grass - slightly down (-1) forb - stable (0) 2008 TREND ASSESSMENT The browse trend is slightly down. Sagebrush density decreased 16%, a nd decadence remained high at 40% of the population. Young recruitment increased slightly fro m 10% of the population to 14%. Plants displaying poor vigor continued to increase, from 24% of the populati on to 29%. The trend for grass is stable. The sum of nested frequency for perennial grasses changed little . Mutton bluegrass increased significantly in nested frequency, while that for Sandberg bluegrass decreased signi ficantly. The trend for forbs is stable. The sum of nested frequency for perennial forbs decreased sli ghtly. Tansymustard decreased significantly in nested frequency. The DCI rating remained very poor.
