A separate Federal Register Notice of Availability will be published when the supplement is released to the public. BLM will continue to accept comments on the May draft EIS, as well as comments on the supplement, until January 3, 2000.

ACTION: Notice of availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement. SUMMARY: Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and implementing regulations, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announces the availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Wyodak Coalbed Methane Development Project. The FEIS analyzes the potential impacts and cumulative effects of proposed coalbed methane (CBM) development on Federal and non-Federal lands in Campbell, Johnson, and Converse Counties, Wyoming. The FEIS is published in abbreviated format. Reviewers will need the ``Wyodak Coalbed Methane Project Draft Environmental Impact Statement'' (DEIS), BLM, May 1999, for review of the complete EIS. Additional analysis and/or specific changes (errata) to the text of the DEIS are found in each chapter of this FEIS. DATES: BLM will accept comments on the FEIS for a period of 30 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publishes their Notice of Availability (NOA) of the FEIS in the Federal Register . We anticipate that EPA will publish its NOA on October 1, ADDRESSES : Send written comments to: Field Manager, Bureau of Land Management, Buffalo Field Office, 1425 Fort Street, Buffalo, WY 82834. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Richard Zander, phone: (307) 684±1100. Copies of the FEIS may be obtained from the following BLM offices: Buffalo Field Office, 1425 Fort Street, Buffalo, Wyoming 82834, (307) 684±1100; Casper Field Office, 1701 East E Street, Casper, Wyoming 82601 (307) 261± 7600; and Wyoming State Office, 5353 Yellowstone Road, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82009, (307) 775±6256. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : BLM received fifty-two comment letters onthe DEIS addressing six basic topics: groundwater (the water model and monitoring); surface water (amounts produced, water management plans, and wetlands); air quality (modeling, authorizing actions, emissions, and air quality related values); geology (development conflicts, coal fires, methane seepage, and subsidence); wildlife and fisheries (programmatic versus site specific analysis, unanticipated new development, and mitigation); and land use (wilderness study area impacts, access, on lease/off lease Federal authority, and reclamation). All comment letters received have been reproduced in the FEIS. All comments were considered and included as part of the BLM decisionmaking process. Based on new and additional information provided by commenters, the groundwater model was rerun. This yielded a better calibrated prediction of modeled drawdowns under the Proposed Action and under Alternative One. Comments, including names and street addresses of respondents, will be available for public review at the Bureau of Land Management, Buffalo Field Office, 1425 Fort Street, Buffalo, Wyoming, during regular business hours (8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.), Monday through Friday, except holidays, and may be published as part of the Record of Decision. Individual respondents may request confidentiality. If you wish to withhold your name or street address from public review or from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, you must state this prominently at the beginning of your written comment. Such requests will be honored to the extent allowed by law. All submissions from organizations or businesses, and from individuals identifying themselves as representatives of officials of organizations or businesses, will be made available for public inspection in their entirety.
