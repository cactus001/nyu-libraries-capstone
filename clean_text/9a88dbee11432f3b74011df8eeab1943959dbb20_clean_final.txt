HDX Dataset Quality Assurance Checklist Background HDX quality assurance (QA) officers should check each new or updated dataset against this checklist to ensure datasets shared on HDX meet the minimum HDX quality standards for datasets. The checklist is in three parts: a) a checklist for dataset resources, b) a data responsibility checklist and c) a metadata quality checklist. Each of these checklists are presented below. A. Dataset Resources Checklist Check each resource in the dataset against the following checklist of 5 Yes No N/A Check Action if check fails ▢ ▢ ▢ The download link is working -Place the resource under review. -Engage the data contributor about the broken link. ▢ ▢ ▢ The download link is not password protected -Place the resource under review. -Engage the data contributor about the password protected file. ▢ ▢ ▢ The file is in useful data format e.g. XLS, CSV, SHP etc and not PDF or Word unless the inaccessible file contains additional metadata. -Place the resource under review. -Engage the data contributor about the inaccessible data format. ▢ ▢ ▢ There is NO PII in the data file -Place the resource under review. -Immediately complete the data responsibility checklist. ▢ ▢ ▢ There is NO DII in the data file -Place the resource under review -Immediately complete the data responsibility checklist ▢ ▢ ▢ There is NO individual survey data in the data file -Place the resource under review. -Immediately complete the data responsibility checklist. ▢ ▢ ▢ The file type is consistent with the file's actual file type -Attempt to fix the inconsistency and engage the data contributor if attempts unsuccessful. ▢ ▢ ▢ The file contains a zipped shapefile and the file type is correctly set as "zipped shapefile" -Attempt to fix the issue so geo preview can work on the dataset.

B. Data Responsibility Checklist C. Metadata Quality Checklist of 5 Yes No N/A Check Action if check fails ▢ ▢ The dataset is safe to share and is not potentially sensitive. - Place the dataset under review - Inform the data contributor - Report the dataset for SDC review ▢ ▢ ▢ If the dataset is potentially sensitive; I have placed the dataset under review -Place the dataset under review ▢ ▢ ▢ If the dataset is potentially sensitive; I have informed the dataset contributor by email that the dataset has been placed under review. -Inform the data contributor using the email template ▢ ▢ ▢ If the dataset is potentially sensitive; I have made an entry in the SDC for Microdata Log - Make an entry in the SDC for Microdata Log for the dataset ▢ ▢ ▢ If the dataset is potentially sensitive, I have informed the HDX SDC taskforce to kick off the disclosure control process - Inform the HDX SDC taskforce about the dataset Title Checks Yes No N/A Check Action if check fails ▢ ▢ The dataset has a title -Make the dataset private -Engage the data contributor about the missing dataset title. ▢ ▢ The dataset title is consistent with the data actually contained in the dataset. -Engage the data contributor about the inconsistent title. Suggest a title if possible. ▢ ▢ ▢ The dataset title is not in camel case -Edit the dataset title into camel case ▢ ▢ ▢ The dataset title does not start with the name of the (place) country, region or place to which the data refers. -Edit the dataset title so it starts with the place name -Inform the data contributor of edit(s) ▢ ▢ ▢ The dataset title does not includes a relative time reference such as current, latest, new, old -Edit the dataset title and remove the references. -Inform the data contributor of edit(s) Description Checks Yes No N/A Check Action if check fails

Generic email addresses and academic citations are fine. -Make the dataset private -Engage the data contributor to remove the PII from the description. Source Checks Yes No N/A Check Action if check fails ▢ ▢ The dataset has a source -Make the dataset private. -Engage the data contributor about the missing source metadata. ▢ ▢ ▢ If the source is listed as Multiple Sources; the multiple sources are clearly listed elsewhere in the dataset (such as in the description, comments or additional metadata file) -Make the dataset private -Engage the data contributor about the missing source metadata. ▢ ▢ The source is a valid source for the data -Make the dataset private. -Engage the data contributor about the invalid source. Date of Dataset Check Yes No N/A Check Action if check fails ▢ ▢ The dataset has a Date of Dataset -Make the dataset private -Engage the data contributor about the missing date of dataset metadata. ▢ ▢ The Date of Dataset is NOT a future date -Engage the data contributor to check whether the date of dataset is indeed in the future. ▢ ▢ The Date of Dataset is consistent with the freshness of the data. In other words, the data is as up-to-date as is suggested by the date of dataset. -Engage the data contributor to check the out-of-date data. Expected Update Frequency Checks Yes No N/A Check Action if check fails ▢ ▢ The dataset has an Expected Update Frequency. -Make the dataset private. -Engage the data contributor about the missing Expected Update Frequency metadata.
