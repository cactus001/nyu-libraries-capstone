Introduction to trauma Page 8What is Trauma?An experience that is perceived as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening, overwhelms our ability to cope, and causes intense reactions such as fear, helplessness, and loss of control. Citation 1, 2

--- Page 8 ---
Introduction to trauma Page 9Types of Trauma •Natural Disasters: Hurricanes, fires, floods •Human Caused Disasters : accidents, wars, displacement •Terrorism •Community Violence: robberies, shootings, assaults •School Violence: threats, shootings, bullying •Interpersonal Violence: abuse, neglect, domestic violence •Poverty •Homelessness •Sudden or anticipated loss of loved one Citation 2, 3

--- Page 9 ---
Introduction to trauma Page 10Historical Trauma : The collective and cumulative trauma experienced by a particular group across generations still bearing the effects. Racial Trauma or Race -based Traumatic Stress: Potentially traumatic experiences related to race may include: direct experiences of racial harassment including threats of harm or injury and being humiliated; witnessing racial violence towards other people of color and other ethnicities such as hate crimes, violence by law enforcement; experiencing discrimination and institutional racism often in the form of racial slurs, being followed in a store, communications that convey rudeness. Youth may experience these in school or in other community settings .Types of Trauma Citation 2,4,5,6

--- Page 10 ---
Introduction to trauma Page 11 In community samples, more than two thirds of students in the U.S. report experiencing trauma by age 16, such as a serious accident, natural disaster, or experiencing or witnessing violence. Approximately two out of three children have been exposed to violence, crime, and abuse in their homes or communities. 50% of youth report more than one form of victimization.Prevalence of Trauma Citation 7.8

--- Page 11 ---
Introduction to trauma Page 12 Youth of color ages 12 to 19 are victims of violent crime more than their white peers. Youth of color are -3x more likely to be victims of of a robbery. -5x more likely to be victims of a homicide. Homicide is the leading cause of death among youth of color ages 15 to 24. Youth of color living in poverty are at increased risk for trauma, particularly violent trauma. African American youth living in urban, low -income communities are more at risk of exposure to violence than any other population in the United States.Prevalence of Trauma Citation 9, 10, 11

Impact of trauma Page 15Human Stress Response for your own subheadline The amygdala (smoke detector) senses threat and sets off the alarm.checks things out to confirm the threat and goes off -line. takes over to initiate the release of hormones (adrenaline, cortisol) that help us to respond (fight or flight) and recover. “EMOTIONAL BRAIN”“THINKING BRAIN”

--- Page 15 ---
Impact of trauma Page 16Citation 12“EMOTIONAL BRAIN”Fear, anxiety, and worry about continued danger Intense mood swings, irritability, and aggression Feelings of sadness, guilt, shame, anger, responsibility, embarrassment Physical symptoms (headaches, stomachaches, change in eating/sleeping) Concern about how others will view them Decline in school performance Increased risk -taking (alcohol/drug use, fights, self -harm) Increased thoughts/comments about death or dying Withdrawal from family, peers, activitiesImpact of Trauma on Youth

--- Page 16 ---
Impact of trauma Triggers: Reminders of past traumatic experiences that automatically cause the body to react as if the traumatic event is happening again in that moment . •Loud noises •Physical touch •Authority figures •Hand or body gestures that appear threatening •Changes in routine •Confusing or chaotic environments •Emergency vehicles or personnel •Anniversary times •LossImpact of Trauma on Youth Page 17Citation 13

--- Page 17 ---
Impact of trauma Page 18Impact of Trauma on Youth subheadline Constant threatThinking brain frequently off-line. Less well -developed Emotional brain remains in survival mode Citation 14, 15•Heightened baseline state of arousal •On alert for threat •Reactive •Sensitive to triggers/reminders of the event •Focused on safety and survival•Thinking, planning, focusing, organizing •Problem -solving •Coping •Self-regulation •Future thinking/ cause and effect •Communicating •Learning new skills

--- Page 18 ---
Relationships: Difficulty trusting others and forming safe, healthy relationships . Emotional Regulation: Difficulty identifying, expressing, and managing feelings . Always on alert for threat. Behavior: Easily set off by others or the environment (especially if reminded of previous trauma). Responses are extreme ranging from aggression to withdrawal. Trouble following rules or guidelines; reactive towards authority figures. oYouth exposed to trauma are more likely to be suspended or expelled for behavioral issues. Impact of Trauma on Youth bheadlineImpact of trauma Page 19Citation 13, 16, 17

--- Page 19 ---
Cognition: More difficulties with activities related to learning. Traumatized youth have poorer academic performance, increased risk of failing, poorer test scores, and higher rates of referral to special education. Dissociation: Disconnection from the present moment as a way to manage overwhelming stress. Blocking out difficult thoughts and feelings often means blocking out most feelings, including positive emotions. Self-Concept and Future Orientation: Low self -esteem and poor self - image are common. Lacking a sense of hope and control over the future making goal setting seem pointless. Impact of Trauma on Youth your own subheadlineImpact of trauma Page 20Citation 13, 16, 17

--- Page 20 ---
Community violence exposure among urban youth is associated with higher rates of post -traumatic stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and aggression. Youth victimization increases likelihood of becoming a perpetrator of violent crimes including intimate partner violence; drug use; and property crimes. 90% of juvenile justice -involved youth have experienced trauma, often multiple traumas from an early age. 96% of adolescent psychiatric inpatients have histories of exposure to trauma. More than 70% of adolescents in substance abuse treatment have a history of trauma exposure .Impact of Trauma on Youth subheadlineImpact of trauma Page 21Citation 9, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22

Impact of Trauma Page 22 Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study Citation 23

--- Page 22 ---
Impact of Trauma Page 23Parents with histories of and/or current exposure to trauma are at increased risk for a number of challenges including: Substance abuse, depression, and PTSD. Negative or unsafe interpersonal patterns such abuse, neglect, and domestic violence that become the source of trauma for youth. Difficulty trusting others and building relationships with community providers and educators, which impacts their child’s ability to trust other adults. Feelings of embarrassment, shame, fear, or guilt about getting outside support for their children that may result in negative interactions with providers/educators. Mistrust of systems that have contributed to traumatic experiences.Impact of Trauma on Families subheadline s Citation 24, 25

--- Page 23 ---
Impact of Trauma Page 24Impact of Trauma on Families subheadline s Consider current societal and institutional factors and inequalities that increase risk of trauma for families of color : A disproportionate number of children and families live in poverty. Living in poverty is accompanied by stressors that can be traumatic and can increase risk for multiple exposures to trauma, particularly violent trauma. Ongoing experiences of racial trauma/Race -based traumatic stress. Lack of culturally -competent services. Mistrust in social institutions (schools, education, government) that impacts help-seeking. Citation 10, 26

--- Page 24 ---
Impact of Trauma Page 25Combined historical and contemporary trauma without the opportunity to heal has detrimental effects on communities of color as a whole. Post-traumatic Slave Syndrome (PTSS): Lower self -esteem, feelings of hopelessness and depression, self - destructive outlook. Increased anger and violence towards self, others, and members of one’s own group. Internalized racism –learned helplessness, distorted concept of self, disconnection or aversion to things related to your own cultural/ethnic group.Impact of Trauma on Communities Citation 27

--- Page 25 ---
Impact of Trauma Page 26Direct exposure to trauma: Community providers and educators may bring their own histories of trauma to their work or experience trauma on the job. Secondary Traumatic Stress: Individuals who work with highly traumatized groups are at risk of being indirectly traumatized as a result of hearing about another person’s trauma and witnessing its negative effects . Vicarious Trauma: Changes in a helper’s inner experience over time as a result of responsibility for an empathic engagement with traumatized clients. Impact of Trauma on Youth -Serving Systems Citation 28

--- Page 26 ---
Impact of Trauma Page 27Examples: Students exposed to trauma are more likely to escalate and act out . Adults may misunderstand and mislablel student behaviors . Adults may become increasingly crisis -driven, reactive, and punitive to maintain control . Difficult to maintain a safe environment most conductive to learning . Schools risk re -traumatizing students by creating environments and situations that mirror or replicate other trauma that students have experienced.Impact of Trauma on Youth -Serving Systems Citation 29Traumatized systems respond similarly to traumatized individuals, which creates an environment that perpetuates trauma responses.

--- Page 27 ---
Impact of Trauma Resilience: Positive, adaptive response to significant adversity. Combined environmental and individual factors that help children achieve positive outcomes in the face of adversity include: The availability of at least one stable, caring, and supportive relationship with an adult. A sense of mastery over life circumstances. Strong social and emotional skills such as problem -solving, self -awareness, self - regulation, and relationship skills that can be supported in school and community settings . Affirming faith or cultural traditions . Environments that are safe, engaging, and supportive.

Adopting a Trauma -Informed Approach What is a trauma -informed approach? Why is a trauma -informed approach critical to supporting youth? What are the core components of a trauma -informed approach? Page 30

--- Page 30 ---
Adopting a Trauma -Informed Approach Page 31Adopting a Trauma -Informed Approach across youth -serving systems and communities means all people at all levels of the system: •Realize the prevalence and impact of trauma on youth, families, communities, and systems. •Recognize the signs of trauma in those they serve. •Respond by integrating knowledge of trauma into policies, procedures and practices. •Resist re-traumatizing youth and families by creating environments that mimic past trauma, cause additional trauma, and compromise resilience and well -being for all.What is a Trauma -Informed Approach? Citation 32

--- Page 31 ---
Adopting a Trauma -Informed Approach Page 32What is a Trauma -Informed Approach? A youth’s challeging behaviors are the result of individual deficits (e.g., what’s wrong with you?). Understands difficult behaviors as purposeful and personal. Focuses on changing the individual to “fix” the problem. Support for youth exposed to trauma is provided by counseling professionals.Traditional Perspective A youth’s challenging behaviors may be ways of coping with trauma (e.g. what happened to you?). Understands difficult behaviors may be automatic responses to stress. Focuses on changing the environment. Support for youth exposed to trauma is the shared responsibility of all youth -serving sytems.Trauma -Informed Perspective

Final Thought “Trauma is a fact of life. It does not, however, have to be a life sentence. Not only can trauma be healed, but with appropriate guidance and support, it can be transformative . . . How we handle trauma (as individuals, communities and societies) greatly influences the quality of our lives.” Peter Levine Page 42
