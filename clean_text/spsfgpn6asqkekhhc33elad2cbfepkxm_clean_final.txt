Luján Highlights $426,000 in Federal Funding for Emergency Watershed Protection Monday, June 10, 2013 Washington, D.C. – Congressman Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico’s Third District highlighted more than $426,000 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the Emergency Watershed Protection Program. These funds help disaster recovery efforts and are aimed at helping New Mexico in the wake of last year’s devastating fire season. “Water is a precious resource that is essential to our way of life in New Mexico. From safe and reliable drinking water to water for our crops and livestock – protecting, restoring and ensuring the vitality of our watersheds is critical, especially during these extreme drought conditions,” Congressman Luján said. “The wildfires in New Mexico over the past few years have threatened to damage our watersheds and impact the daily life of our communities. These federal funds, which enhance our ability to protect and improve watersheds, are important to our state and I will continue to support the Emergency Watershed Protection Program.” New Mexico, one of 15 states allocated funding through the program, will receive $426,577 to help implement recovery projects. Examples of conditions qualifying for assistance include: debris-clogged stream channels, undermined and unstable stream banks, jeopardized water control structures and public infrastructures, and wind-borne debris removal. # # # 1 / 1
