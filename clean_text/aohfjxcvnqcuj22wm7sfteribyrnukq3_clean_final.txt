1STATEMENT OF SENATOR NORM COLEMAN Chairman Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations Hearing On The Defense Travel System: Boon or Boondoggle? (Part II) November 16, 2006 Good morning and thank you for attending today’s hearing. This hearing is part of this Subcommittee’s two-year investigation into various problems associated with the Defense Travel System , commonly called DTS. DTS is the Defense Department’s program designed to arrange and pr ocess travel for all DOD employees. Over the past eight years, the Defense Department has spent roughly half a billion dollars of taxpayers’ money to develop the system. For that huge i nvestment, DTS was supposed to generate cost savings of more than $56 million every year and integrate the Department’s travel planning apparatus. This Subcommittee’s investigation has revealed that, despite those lofty goals and the massive investment of taxpayers’ money, DTS does not pe rform its central purpos e – booking travel – in an effective manner. I want the Department of Defense to have the best travel system in the world because travel is absolutely essential fo r the effective performance of DOD’s mission. And, for a half a billion dollars, DOD ought to have precisely that. As a result, I expect to propose a major revision to the Defense Department ’s travel procedures to make them more effective and less wasteful, and start down the path of getting DOD a travel system that actually works. But first, let’s explore some of the problems with DTS that this Subcommittee has uncovered. More than a year ago, I directed the Subcomm ittee to investigate whether DTS is a boon to the Defense Department or a boondoggle at the expens e of American taxpayers. On August 11 of last year, I wrote Secretary Rumsfeld to request that he suspe nd further implementation of DTS until certain serious problems were addressed. Those issues were the focus of a Subcommittee hearing in Septembe r 2005. In that hearing, this Subcommittee established several importa nt problems associated with DTS: • The development of DTS was f our years behind schedule. • DTS was deployed in barely half of the 11,000 DOD travel sites. • DTS had grown in cost from $273 million to almost $500 million. • Despite that massive investment, DTS did not list all available flight s and did not always identify the lowest available airfare. • To make matters worse, DTS did not identif y all available lodging facilities that offer government rates.

2All of these problems boiled down to two fundamental questions. One of those questions is whether DTS, which purportedly saves 56 million dollars each year, actually saves the taxpayers any money. The next essential question is whether DTS is the best, most cost-effective travel system for the Defense Department. In order to get answers to these vital questions, I asked GAO to determine whether DTS’s purported cost savings were justif ied. I also requested that the Inspector General of the Defense Department determine whether the costs and benef its of DTS established that DTS was the best travel system for the Defense Department. Today, we hear from GAO and the Defense Depa rtment Inspector Genera l and we are getting answers to those questions. In short, the evidence is in a nd it confirms the disappointing truth: DTS does not work. Here is a thumbnail sketch of the results of th e investigations by GAO, the Inspector General and this Subcommittee: • GAO concluded that the projec ted cost savings for DTS are “questionable” and cannot be justified. For instance, GAO found that $31 million of the $56.4 million in estimated savings were based on a single arti cle in a trade industry magazine. • According to the Inspector General, the Defense Department does not know and cannot determine whether DTS is the best trav el system to serve its mission needs. • This Subcommittee has discovere d that travel agents who wo rk with DTS on a daily basis uniformly agree that the system is inefficient, incomplete, and costly. One additional fact reveals just how unpopular DTS is with DOD personnel. This Subcommittee has uncovered that more than 83 percent of DOD personnel who are supposed to use DTS are actually using travel agents to arrange their trav el. As reflected in Exhibit 7, the Subcommittee has found that, of the roughly 755,000 trips undert aken at 42 DOD locations from January through September of this year, only 17 percent were arranged using DTS. Let’s turn to Exhibit 8, which lists some examples where DOD personnel are primarily relying on travel agents. For instance, DOD personnel at Fort Leavenworth booked more than 22,000 trips from January through September of this year and 99.9 percent used travel agents. Only one-tenth of one percent used DTS to plan their travel. DOD personnel at another facility used DTS for a mere eight-tenths of one percent of their trips. Likewise, DOD personnel at Fort Shafter booked 26,425 trips – and 98.3 percent of those trips were arranged using travel agents, rather than DTS. Even the Pentagon, whose employees took more than 50,000 trips so far this year, used DTS less than 20 percent of the time. These facts are disappointing indeed. I am appalled that the Defense Depart ment has spent half a billion dollars to develop a system that doesn’t work as required, that doesn’t save money as we were led to believe, that isn’t being used by DOD personnel, and th at DOD hasn’t even kept the records to determine whether it’s th e best system for its needs. All of this has led me to one simple conclusion: the travel component to DTS is a failure and a waste of taxpayer money. Moreover, I have conc luded that further efforts to resolve DTS’ problems will lead only to a further waste of taxp ayer dollars. The answer is not to continue throwing money at the problem.

3 DOD now has the opportunity to pull the plug on DTS, and I recommend they take it. Because of DTS’ widespread problems, Congres s recently barred DOD fr om funding further implementation of DTS. Instead, Congress has required DOD to conduct an independent study of DTS to determine, among other things, whethe r DTS’ travel and accounting functions can be separated. I believe the study provides the S ecretary of Defense with the opportunity to graciously opt out of DTS’ travel functions and I strongly suggest that he take advantage of the opportunity. Such a step will permit DOD to take advantage of the aspect s of DTS that work – namely, the accounting components – and scrap th e elements that don’t work – namely, the travel functions. It is important to understand the fallacy of the cost savings DOD proposed to generate by reducing travel agent services. DTS’ projected co st-savings are in fact based on a false premise: that you can generate savings by transferring the res ponsibility to select fli ghts, hotels and rental cars from professional travel agents to DOD traveler s and pay the travel agen ts a lower fee. This would be the same as directing all DOD personnel to speak Arabic in order to save money on translation services. DOD is claiming the savi ngs from reduced travel agent fees without considering the cost of havi ng the troops do the work. According to numerous travel agents interviewed by the Subcommittee, they can do the work faster and at less cost. In fact, one travel agent said: “DTS is not cost effective because a travel agent can make all reservations in about fi ve minutes where it takes DOD personnel thirty minutes or more to perform the same functi on.” The time DOD personnel spend making travel reservations could be far better spent on their mission-re lated responsibilities. The commercial travel systems th at travel agents use to book rese rvations are far superior to DTS because they have complete flight, hotel and rental car information. DTS does not. Travel agents can book rail reservations. DTS cannot. Tr avel agents make reserv ations in commercial travel systems that actually book the flight and make the hotel reservation. DTS does not. One travel agent summed up this problem as follows : “The system doesn’t work. It is not a live system that actually books flights or reserves hotel rooms or rental cars. That work is performed by a travel agent.” It is time to stop wasti ng the taxpayers’ money and find a solution that actually works. To that end, I am preparing legislation that wi ll stop the hemorrhaging. I hope to introduce that legislation in the near future in order to end the part of DTS that doesn’t work – the travel planning component – and keep the part that doe s work – the accounting component. At the very least, that will begin the process of getting DOD the best travel serv ice to meet its needs. I look forward to working with Senators Levin and Coburn on this proposal, as I know they have serious interest in this issue. Today, we will hear testimony from representativ es of the Government Accountability Office and the DOD Inspector General who will testify a bout their most recent findings, as well as the reports they wrote that questioned the co sts and benefits that DTS offers DOD. Finally, we will hear from Under Secretary David Chu who is the official responsible for DTS. # # #
