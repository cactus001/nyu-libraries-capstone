EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PurposeWe report the results and analysis of a one year needs assessment studyevaluating whether a medical monitoring and risk communication program is justified for formerand current workers at the Y-12 and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).MethodsTo complete this study, we used available exposure assessment data from paperrecords and electronic databases and reviewed all studies that have been completed at the plants.We also gathered "expert" former and current workers to conduct risk mapping sessions andfocus groups to obtain in-depth information about the plants. We collected and analyzedresponses to a questionnaire that was sent to a stratified random sample of 500 former Y-12 andORNL workers. We obtained employee rosters and basic employment data, to the extentavailable, from the contractors and other institutions.FindingsFormer and current Y-12 and ORNL workers have had significant exposure topulmonary toxins (nickel, asbestos, beryllium, and acids), carcinogens (external and internalradiation, asbestos, beryllium, and cadmium), renal toxins (chlorinated solvents and lead),neurotoxins (mercury, solvents and lead), hepatotoxins (carbon tetrachloride and other solvents)and noise. Epidemiologic studies at Y-12 and ORNL show excess rates of selected diseases,including cancer and selected neurologic effects. Workers are concerned about the effects ofprevious exposures on their health and are very interested in a medical screening and educationprogram. Former workers have good access to health care and engage in periodic healthexaminations. However, most do not believe that their primary care providers know much aboutthe exposures that they had at Y-12 and ORNL. The focus groups and questionnaire responsesalso provided useful guidance about how to establish effective risk communication and medicalsurveillance programs.The target population for a medical screening program among former and currentY-12 and ORNL workers is conservatively estimated to range from 12,000 to 20,000. This rangerequires refinement, but the roster with names and addresses that would allow initiation ofscreening is currently available.ConclusionThe findings of this needs assessment study support a targeted medical andcancer surveillance and education program. This conclusion is based on 1) the evidence thatlarge numbers of workers have had significant exposures to detrimental agents, 2) thedemonstration among Y-12 and ORNL workers of excess risk of cancer, selected neurologiceffects and beryllium-related outcomes in epidemiologic studies, and 3) the need and desireexpressed by former and current workers for a credible targeted program of medical surveillanceand education. A health protection and risk communication program should center on workers atrisk for 1) cancer, 2) chronic respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive lung disease andthe pneumoconioses, 3) kidney, liver and neurologic disease, and 4) hearing loss. Theseconditions are amenable to early intervention, amelioration, and/or primary prevention. A riskcommunication delivered by a credible source will reduce uncertainty and distrust. Afterparticipation in the proposed screening program, former and current Y- 12 and ORNL workerswill have increased real knowledge about their personal health status, what is known about theirrisks, and how they can promote their own health. We believe that mounting such a program inPhase II will make a tangible contribution to the health of former and current Y- 12 and ORNLworkers.

PART I: OVERVIEWI INTRODUCTIONIn January 2003, a consortium led by the Queens College of the City University of NewYork, the Atomic Trades & Labor Council, the Paper Allied-Industrial Chemical and Energy(PACE) Workers International Union, and CPS, Inc. initiated a needs assessment study toevaluate whether former Department of Energy (DOE) workers at the Y-12 and Oak RidgeNational Laboratory (ORNL) would benefit from the establishment of a program of medicalsurveillance under Section 3162 of the 1993 Defense Re-Authorization Act. This assessment wasconducted under a contract from and with the guidance of the Department of Energy The needsassessment at the Y-12 and ORNL facilities benefited from the experience that PACE, QueensCollege, and CPS, Inc. gained by conducted similar needs assessments at the three DOE gaseousdiffusion plants in 1996-1997 and at INEEL in 1998, and by the conduct of medical surveillanceby this consortium at these four facilities from 1997 to the present.To conduct this needs assessment, the Queens College/ATLCIPACE/CPS, Inc.consortium identified the need for four domains of information. These include:•Exposure characterization for the workforce at Y- 12 and ORNL•Epidemiologic and other health studies, to the extent available• Educational and health care needs and expressed interest in medicalsurveillance program• Demographic profile of target populationThese domains corréspoñd to the criteria established by the DOE in its document, Guidance forPhase I Reports and Phase II Applications.Through a focused 12 month effort organized in these domains, we have addressed thespecific issues raised by the Department of Energy in determining whether a medical surveillanceprogram is needed and would benefit the targeted populations. These specific issues includecharacterizing the type and degree of relevant detrimental exposures; defining essential healthimpacts; defining the size of the target populations, and finally, documenting the need forestablishing a program that will combine medical monitoring with risk communication.To provide answers to these questions was an ambitious task. Y-12 and ORNL are largecomplex facilities that have been in operation and evolution for 60 years. Much of the currentwork at Y-12 is classified. Information on exposures, both radiologic and chemical, are diverseand inexactly related to known information on health outcomes in the Y-12 and ORNLworkforces. The limited period of the needs assessment required that we use secondary datasources and published studies. Nonetheless, given the goals of the expected medical surveillanceprogram, sufficient information was available to allow a description of the rationale for suchscreening and to provide the information that is needed to conduct such medical surveillance.The study team had the great advantage of having excellent access to and high credibilitywith many members of the workforce that have operated and continue to operate Y-12 and ORNLand excellent cooperation of the DOE, NNSA, and BWXT personnel at the sites. The needsassessment has also benefited from previous in-depth epidemiologic and exposure assessmentstudies. Our challenge during the past 12 months has been to combine current study-basedknowledge of these sites with the collective knowledge possessed by the Y-12 and ORNL 1

--- Page 6 ---
workforce in order to gain a sufficient understanding of cumulative exposures at these facilitiesand how they might impact current health This report provides a snapshot of this combinedknowledge. It is anticipated that understanding how exposures impact workers' health at thesefacilities will be an ongoing task during the medical surveillance phase.Throughout the needs assessment process, the Queens College/ATLC/PACE/CPSconsortium has abided by a central principle of the project: to maximize involvement of workersand scientists from Y-12 and ORNL in all aspects of the conduct of the needs assessment processand the planning of the medical surveillance and risk communication program. We have usedthis method for several essential reasons. The most obvious is that the workforce of thesefacilities represents an excellent source of information for identifying the hazards that haveexisted at Y-12 and ORNL over the past 60 years. This knowledge complements and vivifies theknowledge that we have gained from the many reports and studies that have been conducted atthese facilities over the past decades. Second, the study consortium understands that theeffectiveness of a program planning process will be enormously enhanced if all participants in theprogram are involved. Finally, health protection, the ultimate goal of the DOE Worker MedicalSurveillance Program, requires workers acting on their own behalf. Beginning to overcome themany years of uncertainty, distrust and ignorance that some workers at DOE facilities haverequires an open and participatory process from the inception of a medical surveillance program.This report does not contain an exhaustive list of all of the medical needs that workers atY-12 and ORNL might have as a result of their occupational exposures. Creating such acomplete inventory of all health risks that Y-12 and ORNL workers have or might have wasbeyond thescope,the mandate and the resources available to the Queens___College/ATLCIPACE/CPSconsortium in the past 12 months. We recognize that the DOE formerworker medical surveillance program is limited in nature and will have limited resources over thenext several years.Hence, we concentrated on exposures and possible health outcomes that best meet thecriteria that DOE has established for this program as reflected in Section 3162 that created theprogram. Specifically, we have attempted to identify significant exposures, as supported byavailable qualitative and quantitative data, that have or are likely to produce health impacts thatmight be alleviated by early detection and/or by communication with the potentially affectedworkers. There are likely to be other exposure-disease relationships of relevance to Y-12 andORNL workers that deserve the attention of the Department of Energy. This would includepossible health impacts that have not yet been fully investigated in the workforce; exposures forwhich data are insufficient to allow judgment about the likelihood of their significance, healthimpacts that had been demonstrated to exist but may or may not be occupational in etiology; andhealth outcomes that are not amenable to screening or for which early detection does not lead tofruitful intervention. Pursuing these possibilities, however important, was not part of the mandatethat we received from the Department of Energy. Nor could we take responsibility for followingup these potential occupational risks, given the limited time and resources available to us duringthis 12 month needs assessment.This report is organized into two parts to satisfy the competing goals of being succinctand of being substantive. Part I (Introduction, Methods, and Principal Findings) is intended as anoverview in order to communicate the principal methods used and the results thereby obtained.This overview distills the more detailed collections and summaries of data which are presented in—PartII (Sections 5through8). Section 5providesdetails about the type and levels of exposuresexperienced by former workers at Y-12 and ORNL as identified in available industrial hygieneand health physics data and through risk-mapping sessions. Section 6 presents the results of focus 2

___groupsof former and current Y-12 and ORNL workers in assessing health concerns, evaluatingrthe level of knowledge and perceived risks and eliciting opinions about how to conduct a medicalsurveillance program. Section 7 provides a summary of available epidemiologic studies that havebeen conducted at Y-12 and ORNL. Section 8 provides the results of a questionnaire sent to 500former Y-12 and ORNL workers to collect information on exposures and current health care.Readers are encouraged to read Part II in detail to gain a full understanding of study methodologyand the types of information that underlie the summaries presented in Part I.II. METHODOLOGYWe employed a number of methods of study during this 12 month needs assessment.These methods were chosen based on the ability to obtain reliable data within a limited timeperiod, the desire to include rank and file workers in the data-gathering process, and the need toacquire information that would allow us to plan the risk communication and health servicecomponent of a medical surveillance program.Descriptions included in this report that derive from project activities that addressexposures, work processes, and site activities have been reviewed and cleared by the DOEsecurity office in Oak Ridge. This includes the information that was collected through directdiscussions with Y-12 and ORNL workers during the risk mapping and focus groups.A. Review of Existing Exposure RecordsThe primary focus of this component of the exposure assessment was to determine, to theextent possible, the nature and intensity of major exposures as a function of building, area,department, and/or job classification. Another primary need was to determine whether we couldestablish an approach for linking the building, department and exposure data to individuals withinthe worker cohortA full listing of the major sources of health physics and industrial hygiene data that weused from Y-12 and ORNL is provided in Section 5.B.Risk mappingRisk Mapping is an approach that has been used extensively at industrial facilities as atool to assist workers and/or joint health and safety committees in detennining high risk areaswithin their facilities. Traditionally, the technique is used to identify current problem areas with afacility and to assist in developing an intervention strategy for resolving the problem areas. CPS,Inc. and PACE performed extensive risk mapping as part of the DOE-supported medicalsurveillance program at the gaseous diffusion plants and INEEL. In the current project, CPS, Inc.worked closely with ATLC, using the risk mapping approach to map past exposure conditions atY-12 and ORNL.In addition to using the mapping process for locating past exposure conditions within thebuildings of interest, the method was modified to allow the field researchers to collect semi-quantitative exposure data for each identified exposure of concern. Field researchers alsocollected data regarding other building and process characteristics (i.e., description of majorprocesses, number of workers in the building of interest, and years of operation).Several steps were necessary to develop the risk mapping activity at Y-12 and ORNL.We customized the risk mapping method for use in retrospective exposure assessment. We used 3

--- Page 8 ---
the following tools, which we had previously developed at the DOE gaseous diffusion plants andINEEL, for field use:• Job Exposure Information Sheet to collect job/process/exposure information for eachchemical agent identified on the risk map.• Building Characteristics Report Form to allow field researchers to collect descriptiveinformation on the buildings of interest over time (i.e., description of major process,number of workers, and years of operation).• Risk Mapping Training Guidebook to train the field researchers in the risk-mappingtechnique.The risk mapping study group, led by Mark Griffon of CPS, Inc., conducted a one daytrain-the-trainer session for the field researchers. The field researchers included ATLC unionhealth and safety representatives, and an experienced PACE risk map leader from thePACE/Queens College/CPS, Inc project participated as well."Experts" were then selected for the initial risk mapping session from each of the twosites. The ATLC, CPS, mc, and PACE worked together to identify and to assemble an "expert"team of former workers for the initial risk mapping sessions The "experts' selected for the initialsessions consisted primarily of hourly workers with extensive experience at the sites. Several linesupervisors were also included in these sessions. "Experts" were not selected at random, butbased on their vast amount of site experience and the broad array of job classifications andprocess buildings where they worked.The initial risk mapping session focused on the entire Y-12 and ORNL facilities and wasconducted to assist in determining priority areas for future, more specific, risk mapping sessions.As a product of this session, the expert group produced a list of primary facilities of highestconcern regarding retrospective exposures. This list, along with information obtained throughreview of other monitoring data, was used to identify areas for subsequent risk mapping sessions.The second round of risk-mapping sessions were conducted to learn more about thepriority buildings at each of the facilities that were identified in the initial session Informationwas systematically collected utilizing the tools noted above, including the Job ExposureInformation Sheet and the Building Characteristics Report Form.All of the information obtained for risk-mapping sessions was compiled into a databaseto allow for assessment of the data.To date, a total of 20 risk mapping sessions have been conducted These risk-mappingactivities have included approximately 60-70 retirees. In each session, an attempt was made toobtain the participation of representatives from a variety of job titles who worked in the buildingin question. We succeeded in that we were able to include representatives from supervision,scientists/engineers, liPs, operators, and maintenance crafts.The findings of the risk mapping sessions are summarized within Section ifi of Part I ofthis report and the database report of the data collected from the individual sessions is included inSection V. A breakdown of exposures by building is included within an appendix of Section V. 4

C. Focus groupsFocus groups of former workers were conducted in order to obtain in-depth informationabout a variety of issues, including exposures, perceptions of risk, health concerns, health care,and receptivity to a health screening program. The overall design, recruitment strategy, training,and analysis were led by Sylvia Kieding of PACE International Union in consultation with CarlScarbrough, ATLC President, and health and safety representatives of ATLC. The actualimplementation of the focus groups was led by former or current workers from Y-12 and ORNLwithassistance of Tom Moser of PACE.Established ATLC health and safety representatives at Y-12 and ORNL were recruited toserve as moderators for the focus group sessions. They were trained using a Moderator Guidespecifically developed for this project (available upon request). To prepare, moderatorsparticipated in a day long training seminar and role-play. Another OCAW member was recruitedand trained to serve as the scribe for each focus group session.Two focus groups were held at Y-12 and ORNL on July 8 and August 5, 2003(four intotal). A total of 33 people participated in the four focus groups. The sessions were held in asecured room in the Y-12 Security Building. All participants received a participant informationsheet and signed informed consent forms that had been read aloud to the group before the session.The sessions were audiotaped with the full knowledge and unanimous consent of participants.All focus groups at both sites were comprised of "experts," both retirees and activeworkers, who were selected by the local union officers and ATLC health and safety staff due totheir knowledge of the plant and familiarity with plant operations.In a preliminary analysis of the transcripts of focus group sessions, an initial codingscheme of important themes was developed. Ms. Kieding undertook a basic coding and sortingof themes and provided illustrative quotes from the transcriptions. These are presented in detailin Part II, Section 6 of this report.D. Questionnaire SurveyIn order to obtain exposure and limited health information from a broad cross-section ofthe former workforce at Y- 12 and ORNL, a questionnaire was developed and sent to a randomsample of 500 retired and terminated Y-12 and ORNL workers. The base population from whichthis sample was drawn includes a total of 7,118 workers, consisting of 3,891 Y-12 retirees and3,227 ORNL retirees. This group of 7,118 workers represents the total number of living retireesreceiving a pension through BWXT. We randomly selected 250 employees from each facility toobtain the total of 500. Note that the questionnaire was returned anonymously. We requested thatthe responder's name not be written on the returned questionnaire to avoid any potential problemswith confidentiality.A six page questionnaire was developed (Part II: Section VIII, Appendix A) thatrequested information on demographic status; history of job title, exposures, and plants ofemployment; health concerns; current health care; and interest in screening and education. Acheck list of 63 specific exposures was included in the questionnaire for Y-12 and ORNLemploymentseparately. The questionnaire was approved by the Institutional Review Boards ofOak Ridge Associated Universities and Queens College of the City University of New York. Acopy of the questionnaire was sent to the selected 500 individuals with a cover letter co-signed byCarl Scarbrough, ATLC President; and Steven Markowitz, MD, project director. The 5

questionnaires were sent by first class U.S. mail in order that the letters with incorrect addresseswould be returned to the project office. We report here the findings from the returned completedquestionnairesE. Review of Epidemiologic StudiesWe obtained all published epidemiologic and health studies that are available for Y-12and ORNL.G. Demographic Profile of Target PopulationRosters of Y-12 and ORNL employeeswho currently receive pensions were obtainedfrom BWXT. Available data on these retirees include name, current address, home telephonenumber, date of birth, date first employed by the company, and last date of employment.III. PRINCIPAL FINDINGSA. Hazards and Exposure Levels of Former Y-12 and ORNL Workers: Results ofRecords Review and Risk-MappingFor the purposes of planning a medical surveillance program, it is most useful to organizethe large numbers of diverse exposures encountered at the Y- 12 and ORNL facilitiesby principal human organ or organ systems affected. In cases where a health effect has been identified by joboperation (e g -welding) rather than by single exposure then job title or operation becomes thetool used to organize health effects Employing this means of considering hazardous exposuresyields Table I-I.Our knowledge about the magnitude of the exposures cited above derives from severalsources: external radiation monitoring, industrial hygiene data, risk mapping sessions, focusgroups, and questionnaire results. All of these methods have limitations, as detailed in Part II ofthis report. A brief summary of data for the most important exposures is provided in the section:the reader is urged to see the additional description in Part II. 6

In view of this aim, data collection in the early years was very limited for workerswho were considered to have low potential for exposure.

information is available concerning the rationale used to decide which workers to monitorimplementation of these decisions, and the methods used for assessing reliability, variability, andlower limits of detection. At each facility, the radiation safety personnel were responsible for themonitoring program, making the programs essentially independent of each other.Because internal monitoring programs were begun at ORNL in 1951 and at Y-12 in 1950,the definition of "not monitored" varies by plant and by year. By the early 1950s, a worker whowas not monitored for internal exposure was judged to have low potential for exposure. Becauseof policies in effect, external monitoring data are available for most workers from Y-12 onlybeginning in 1961. ORNL began monitoring for external radiation in 1943 (Watkins, 1993).A.1.2 External Radiation ExposureBefore November 1951, only those workers entering areas of potential external radiationexposure were monitored for external dose. In 1947, all workers entering a radiation area morethan three times a week were assigned permanent film badges. By 1949, permanent film badgeswere issued to all workers who entered these restricted areas at least once a week. In November1951, all workers entering the main X- 10 area were required to have a film badge, and bySeptember 1953, the film badge and security badge needed for entry were combined into onebadge (Watkins, 1993). Risk mapping participants reported that they often worked using a selfreading dosimeter (SRD) and not wearing a film badge. They mentioned that the SRD readingswere recorded in HP logs but they were uncertain if this information was included in theirpersonal dose record. (Risk Mapping Interviews, 2003)According to site records, X-10 only used daily SRDs from 1943 until about 1945. In1945, they began to use weekly film badges and continued until the late 1950s, when theychanged to quarterly film badges. In 1975, they began to use either quarterly or annual TLDs. Atthe Y-12 facility, they also started with SRDs, progressing to weekly film badges in 1950,monthly film badges in 1959-1960, and quarterly film badges from 1960 until 1980. After 1980,they used either quarterly or annual TLDs. From 1961-1974, badges used by workers in areas oflow potential exposure were not always read. Rather, a sample of the badges issued was read toverify that the areas were being properly defined. For early film badges, the minimum detectabledose was approximately 25 mrem. The sensitivity of film badges in later years was improved(Watkins, 1993).After extensive error checking procedures, annual external doses were calculated bysumming all credible gamma and neutron film badge readings taken during the year. Because ofthe variability in dosimeter types, reading frequencies, and monitoring policies over time andfacilities, annual doses obtained from the simple summation of readings during the year may notbe comparable at all times, and a recorded dose may not always accurately represent the trueamount of a worker's radiation exposure. A summary of the recorded annual doses by year and bydepartment is included in Appendix F. This appendix contains a compilation of dose data fromthree sources: H&S reports, CEDR CER data files, and CEDR Mortality study data files. Themortality study data files included some extrapolation of doses for times when data were missingand, therefore, the results are different than the other data sets. A summary of the external dosedata (annual doses greater than 500 mrem) versus department is included in Appendix B. 8

A.1.3 Internal Radiation Exposure Film badges measure external exposure over a given period of time. In contrast,monitoring for internal exposure is performed at specific points in time and, hence, yield resultsthat are estimates of the body or organ burden at the time of measurement. The primary methodsof internal monitoring used were urinalysis and in vivo gamma spectrometry, but fecal analysiswas also performed in some instances. The dosimetry associated with analysis of urine forradioisotopes of concern depends on relating the amount of an isotope in a reference volume ofurine to the amount contained in the body or in specific organs. The relationship between thesetwo amounts is affected by many variables, such as the radioisotope, time since exposure, thechemical and physical form of the isotope, and biological variation among individuals.In general, workers were monitored only if they worked in locations or administrativegroups that were judged by supervisors or radiation safety organizations to have had potential forinternal exposure. Periodically after 1950, individual samples from usually unmonitored workerswere randomly selected and monitored by ORNL to confirm that such workers were indeedunexposed to internal radiation The policy at Y-12 was to increase monitoring frequency as thepotential for internal exposure increased. (Watkins, 1993, Patterson, 1957, West, 1977)Workers at TEC had a high potential for internal contamination due to the processesperformed at the facility. However, personal monitoring data were not available because nobioassay or whole body counting programs were established during the years when it was inoperation.A.1.4 Review of External and Internal Data from Databases and HP ReportsThere is an increasing trend in external doses at ORNL until the late 1950s and a steadydecrease afterwards, while there is greater variability in the total recorded annual external dosesat Y-12. A Y-12 peak in 1958 was due to a criticality accident involving eight workers and didnot represent a general increase in external dose (Appendix F).The percentage of individuals monitored for external exposures at X-10 remained atabout 85% to 90% from 1950-1985 while the percentage at Y-12 was at about 20% until 1960when it was raised to 85% to 90%. Generally, the percentage of workers monitored for internalexposures was between 20% and 40% each year with the highest percentages for both plantsoccurring around 1963 to 1965.A summary of the annual radiation dose ranges for the X-10 site is included in AppendixF. It is interesting to note that in 1960 there is a sharp drop off in the number of individuals withannual doses in excess of 2 rem and also a sharp increase in the number of individuals beingmonitored.A 1958 HP report indicated that, among the ten highest cumulative doses due topenetrating radiation, nine individuals were from the Radioisotope Production Division. Thecumulative doses were received over 7 to 15 years and ranged from 42.5 — 64.8rem. (Hart, 1958)HP risk mapping participants thought that the worst areas for internal exposures wereBuildings 3038 3517 and 3019 9

--- Page 14 ---
Recorded external doses at Y-12 were generally lower than doses at X-10 Theonly significant internal monitoring was uranium urinalysis and in vivo testing (uranium-235 andthorium). Over the years it was assumed that monitoring for uranium would be satisfactory as asurrogate measure of other contaminants in the uranium (i.e., transuranics, such as neptunium andplutonium, or fission products in recycled fuel). Data were unavailable to determine whetherthere were processes or areas where these transuranic materials may have concentrated andtherefore represented a greater potential hazard. Additionally, a recent report discussing thecUrrent Y-12 internal dose program (Eckerman, 1999) stated that "following the recent re-start ofoperations at the Y-12 Plant, the Radiological Control Organization (RCO) observed thatenriched uranium exposures appeared to involve insoluble rather than soluble uranium thatpresumably characterized most earlier Y-12 operations." Based on this finding, the bioassayprogram was modified, particularly specifying the need for routine fecal sampling. This raisesquestions with regard to potential missed doses.A.2 BerylliumData from the Y-12 Beryllium Worker Enhanced Medical Surveillance Program, fundedby DOE, indicated that the buildings associated with CBD cases or sensitized workers included:Alpha-5, 9202, Butler Building, Beta-4, Beta-2, 9212, 9766, 9995 and 9998. (Bingham, 1997)Additionally, a 1973 Y-12 document (DOE, 1973) identified Alpha-5, Alpha-3, 9202,and 9995 as "Beryllium Control Areas." H&S summary reports from 1953-1960 indicate thatberyllium air sampling was frequently conducted in Building 9766 and, to a lesser extent, inBuilding 9212 (Appendix D).A broad-based approach to defining groups potentially exposed to beryllium isrecommended since published data demonstrate that individuals with low-level exposure can beaffected (Newman 1989, Kreiss 1996). For this reason, a two-tiered approach is recommendedbased on exposure groupsA.3 MercuryThe mercury concentration in the workplace air was monitored frequently at the Y-12facility. For example, in 1956, over 200,000 air mercury readings were taken (Appendix D). Inthe 1955 cascade start-up, many readings of mercury concentrations in the workplace air werehigher than the 0.1 mg/rn3 then recommended. (The current recommended permissible exposurelevel for mercury is 0.05 mg/rn3). A urinalysis program started in 1953 was expanded to providea check on the worker mercury exposures. During 1955 and into 1956, approximately 200 to 300workers had readings that exceeded the recommended limit of 0.3 mg/liter of urine. When aworker's urinary mercury remained elevated for several specimens the workers were re-assignedApproximately 70 workers were involved in temporary re-assignments of this nature. In additionto the air sampling and urine program, there was a special medical surveillance programinvolving clinical examinations of mercury workers being performed every six months. Personswith a history of albuminuria, kidney problems, or hypertension were screened out and notallowed to work with mercury. (Mercury Task Force, 1983(a), 1983(b))During the latter part of the Colex start-up during 1955, ABC and Y-12 managementundertook a crash program to bring the workplace mercury vapor levels down to acceptablelevels. Air sampling results seem to suggest that airborne concentrations were reduced after1955, as indicated by the drop in the percentage of air samples in excess of the 0 1 mg/rn3 limit(see Appendix D). 10

According to a 1977 report, Mercury Inventory at Y-12 Plant, 1950 through 1977, 2.4million pounds of mercury at Y-12 had been 'lost' or 'unaccounted for' (Mercury Task Force,1983(a), 1983(b)).A Emory University study conducted in 2000 as a follow-up to University of Michiganstudy of the mercury workers at Y-12 showed that 'neurological effects of relatively heavyexposure were still detectable more than 30 years after cessation of that exposure'. The studyconcluded that the exposure measure with the strongest association with the outcome wascumulative exposure (cases were selected by cumulative exposure of  2000 ug of Hg/liter-quarter, or a one-time urine value of greater than 600 ug of Hg/liter). The department numbersidentified as "High Exposure Potential" in the Emory report included: 2025, 2026, 2681, 2682,2683, 2685, and 2690. (Emory University)Priority buildings (buildings where frequent sampling for mercury was conducted and/ora high percentage of samples were identified in excess of the site MPC levels), based on companyIII records (Appendix D), included: Beta-4, Alpha-2, 9202, Alpha-5 and Alpha-4. According toa 1957 Health Physics Program Report (Y- 1186) (Patterson, 1957) "a routine mercury vaporsampling program is maintained in Buildings 9201-2, 9201-4, 9201-5, 8 1-10, and 9204-2;buildings in which a potentially serious mercury vapor problem may exist". During 1955through 1956, the percentage of mercury urine samples which exceeded the MPC (0.3mg/mA3)ranged from 10% to 30%. A further breakdown of these data indicates that machinists wereexposed to the highest levels while chemical operators were lower and electricians still lower.The machinists reported concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 0.3 mg Hg/liter, the chemicaloperators ranged from 0.46 to 0.3, and reported concentrations for electricians exposures rangedfrom 0.12 to 0.2 ug Hg/liter (Mercury Task Force, 1983(a), 1983(b).)At X-lO, Building 4501 housed the Orex pilot project, which was reported to have had alot of mercury during risk mapping sessions. Other uses of mercury at the X-10 site appear to beon a smaller scale (instruments, labs, etc.). It should however, be pointed out that many X-10workers began working at the Y-12 site (as X-10 employees) after the calutron operations wereshut down.A.4 CausticsNitric acid and hydrofluoric acid were used extensively in isotope separation andpurification operations. Specifically, Buildings 3019, 9212, 9215, 3505, Alpha-5, 9203, 9206,9929, and 9401-2 were involved in uranium or other isotope recovery, processing, separation orpurification. Steps within these processes involved many caustic materials including two of theprimary acids used, hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid (in some cases, fuming nitric acid).H&S summary reports indicate that air sampling for lithium was conducted at the Y-12site. Risk mapping participants mentioned that lithium at the site caused strong lung irritation andsometimes frequent sneezing. Also, there were frequent skin bums from working with thismaterial.Additionally, tetramethyl ammonium borohydrate (TMAB) was present at the Y-12 siteand is a strong irritant, similar in toxic properties to other boron compounds. 11

A.5 SolventsChlorinated solvents were used extensively at both the Y-12 and X-10 facilities over thehistory of the sites. Generally, the use of carbon tetrachioride was only prevalent during the earlyyears of operation. TCE and perchioroethylene were used extensively throughout the history ofthe sites. The areas with maximal potential exposures included the pilot separation or processingbuildings and the machine shops. Participants in the risk mapping sessions indicated that themachinists would "use perc to put out chip fires while machining uranium' They indicated theywould 'use it for everything'.In addition to the common chlorinated solvents mentioned above and used for cleaningand degreasing, acetonitrile was used at the Y-12 site.A.6 NoiseNoise exposure was reported as a problem associated with production operations at boththe X-1O and Y-12 sites. The type of operations conducted at the sites over the history (e.g.separations operations, calutrons, lithium separation operations, machining) would be consistentwith elevated noise exposures. Risk mapping participants also indicated that hearing protectionrequirements, or the adherence to the requirements, was fairly lax in the early years.A.7 AsbestosAs in many of the DOE facilities, asbestos use was prevalent at both X-10 and Y-12.Asbestos was common in all building materials, other reported uses included asbestos blanketsasbestos covering on piping, and asbestos gloves. Highest exposures to asbestos would likelyhave occurred among maintenance workers.B. Questionnaire ResultsThe above-cited agent-specific analysis is principally the results of the risk-mappingsessions in combination with limited industrial hygiene and radiation monitoring data. We alsosent a questionnaire to a broad cross-section of retirees and terminated workers (n = 500)andhave, to date, received nearly a 50% response rate.A six page questionnaire was developed that requested information on demographicstatus; history of job title, exposures, and job locations at Y-12 and ORNL; health concerns;current health care; and interest in screening and education. A check list of 63 specific exposureswas included in the questionnaire. A copy of the questionnaire was sent to the 500 individualsthat represented a random sample of retirees and terminated workers from Y-12 and ORNLOf the 500 questionnaires sent, we received 247 (49.4%) completed questionnaires. Wereceived this response after a single mailing, which is an excellent result. We did not sendreminders, because we did not know who responded and did not want to send reminders to peoplewho had responded.Most respondents first worked for DOE in the 1940's (15%), 1950's (40%) or 1960's(22%). Most retired from DOE work in the 1980's (32%) or 1990's (52%). The mean age was 73(s d =86) years with 44% being age 75 or older Only 1% was less than the age of 55 years ,12

A majority of respondents (136, or 55%) did not list union membership, probablybecause they were not members of unions. Among the unions most commonly mentioned werelAM Local 480— machinists (n=30, 12.1% of total), JBEW Local 760— electrical workers (n=24,9.7% of total), ATLC (n=15, 6.1% of total) or Plumbers/Pipefitters Local 718 (n=10, 4.0% oftotal). Other unions cited were boilermakers, guards, chemical workers, laborers, sheet metalworkers, services employees, and Teamsters. There were 87 job titles represented among the firstjob cited by respondents. The most common jobs were engineer, machinist, electrician, chemicaloperator, secretary, and technician. Job titles listed as the second job showed a similar pattern.Table 1-2 lists the exposures and their reported frequencies on the completedquestionnaires at X-l0. The number of people responding to this question varied; percentagesreported include only affirmative or negative responses For all but a few exposures, over one-half of respondents reported exposure. Especially common was reported exposure to metals(>60%); solvents (>60%); external and internal radiation (>95%); irritants (>60%); and asbestosdust (>90%). Beryllium exposure was reported by 88% of respondents.Table 1-3 lists the exposures and their reported frequencies on the completedquestionnaires at Y-12. The number of people responding to this question varied; percentagesreported include only affirmative or negative responses For all but a few exposures, mostlyradioactive species, over one-half of respondents reported exposure. Exposures among Y-12workers were reported more commonly than among X-10 workers. Especially common wasreported exposure to metals (>60%); solvents (>70%); external and internal radiation (>95%);irritants (>80%); and asbestos dust (>95%). Beryllium exposure was reported by 96% ofrespondents.We also obtained information about job titles that respondents had over their careers atY-12 AND ORNL). Over 300 job titles have been cited. We are currently aggregating these jobtitles in order to better characterize common exposures among similar job titles. 13

C. Nature and Extent of Health Impacts Experienced by Y-12 and ORNL WorkersThe review of epidemiological studies is succinct, and the reader is referred to Part II:Section 7. Epidemiologic studies at Y-12 and ORNL show excess rates of selected diseases,including cancer, especially lung cancer, beryllium-related sensitivity and disease, asbestos-related disease, and selected neurologic effects.D. Educational Needs and Health Concerns of Former WorkersWe have two sources of information on the health concerns, health care, and educationalneeds of former Y-12 and ORNL workers: the focus groups and the questionnaire results.D.1 Focus Group ResultsThe focus groups were invaluable in providing insight about how former workers viewedthe "significance" of their prior exposures, and their current state of knowledge, health concerns,and health care. Inclusion of 23 workers, most of whom had more than 25 to30 years ofemployment at Y-12 and ORNL), provided a broad spectrum of opinion. A wide range of jobtitles were represented in the groups.The following themes and recommendations arose during the focus group sessions:1. The need exists for an occupational medical surveillance program.Focus group participants felt that an occupational medical program wasnecessary because of their primary care physicians' lack of knowledge of theimpact of occupational exposures.2. Independent physicians without any ties to DOE or the contractors should administerthe medical testing program in cooperation with ATLC.Participants cited trust and credibility as the most important components of anymedical testing program or there would be lack of interest and participation.They discouraged Oak Ridge as a testing site because of its close ties with DOEand the contractors. Local clinics should be used but they should be withindriving distance.3. The testing program should incorporate plant medical records.Participants stressed their desire to include plant medical records, if feasible, in theevaluation.4. Participants favored directly mailed invitations to inform workers of the program.The workers felt that the best way to reach X-10 and Y-12 workers is throughdirect mail, perhaps having the contractors send a notice with the pension andpay checks.5.Thetesting program should be ongoing rather than a one-time evaluation. 16

--- Page 21 ---
Participants repeatedly stressed the need for periodic testing because a clean billof health at one time is no guarantee against future disease6. Current as well as former workers should participate in the testing program.The focus group members felt that the program should begin with the retirees butshould include current workers because of the mistrust of the site clinic.7. All of the participants expressed a desire that early detection of lung cancer throughthe CT scan should be implemented as part of their program.Additional detail regarding these issues is provided the complete analysis by SylviaKieding in Section VI of Part II of this report.D.2 Questionnaire ResultsOver three-quarters of the respondents reported that they had seen a physician during the12 months prior to completing the questionnaire (87%). Nearly all (98%) of respondents reportedhaving a personal physician. Over three-quarters of respondents (n= 199, 83%) reported that theyhave periodic checkups when they are not ill. The vast majority of respondents have healthinsurance (n=235, or 97%).When asked whether they were concerned that their health might have been affected byworking at Y- 12 and ORNL, 62% (n= 144) reported that they believed that their current or futurehealth might be so affected. On the other hand, the majority of the respondents were interested inEparticipating in a medical screening if offered Nearly 60% of respondents (n=242, or 59%)stated that they were somewhat to very interested in participating in a screening.The majority of respondents (176, or 76%) reported that their personal physician knewthat they had worked at Y- 12 and ORNL. However, when asked if their personal physicians wereaware of their specific exposures that they had had at Y- 12 and ORNL, the vast majority (156, or67%) reported that they did not believe that their physician was aware of the specific exposuresthat they had had at Y-12 and ORNL.E. Size of the Target PopulationEstimating the size of the target population naturally requires defining what the targetpopulation is.In the following section, we provide the rationale for a targeted medicalsurveillance program that meets the criteria established by the Department of Energy. We willsubmit a full plan for Phase II, which will describe in detail the rationale and design of a medicalsurveillance and risk communication program.To fulfill the mandate for medical surveillance established by the DOE, we will propose amedical monitoring program designed to detect and to reduce the burden of chronic lung djsease,cancer, kidney and liver disease, and hearing loss.• Preventive Pulmonary Health Workers at Y-12 and ORNL are likely to be atincreased risk of a variety of lung diseases, including chronic obstructive lungdisease, pneumoconioses, and lung cancer. They worked with a variety of irritants,ffibrogenic dusts and lung carcinogens (asbestos and beryllium at a minimum) It isjustified to include all workers with significant exposures to lung irritants, asbestos 17

--- Page 22 ---
and other lung carcinogens, mercury and beryllium in a medical screening and riskcommunication program. Since these agents were in widespread use at Y-12 andORNL, large numbers of Y- 12 and ORNL workers were likely to have experiencedthese exposures.• Cancer Detection program Significant exposure to a variety of carcinogensoccurred at Y-12 and ORNL over the life of these facilities. Former and current X-l0andY- 12 workers would benefit from a targeted cancer detection and educationprogram. Lung cancer is the single most important cancer among Y- 12 and ORNL,because it is common and has been found to occur in excessive rates among workersat these facilities.• Hearing Loss Excessive noise exposure likely occurred at selected parts of the Y-12 and ORNL complex, leaving nearby workers at risk for hearing loss. For workerswho were in those areas, a hearing testing program would be justified and beneficial.•Diseases of Other Organs Exposure to metals and solvents was common at Y-12and ORNL. Screening for kidney, liver, and relevant neurologic disease would beappropriate for such workers. These screening program elements and targeted conditions are entirely consistent withthe currently-funded DOE former worker medical surveillance programs at other sites and withthe national medical screening protocol established by DOE for this program.Results of the risk-mapping exercises yield observation on which facilities, buildings andjob titles appear to be associated with the greatest likelihood of significant levels of specificexposures. The details were provided in a previous section and also in Section V of Part II of thisreport.Estimation of the numbers of workers who are alive and at risk for occupational diseasemust be approximate. The roster of currently pensioned alive workers from Y-12 and ORNLincludes a total of 7,118 workers, consisting of 3,891 Y-12 retirees and 3,227 ORNL retirees.This group of retirees currently receive a pension through BWXT, and we have current addressesfor them.Terminated workers who did not work long enough to receive a pension are moredifficult to estimate. In the mortality studies at Y-12 (Loomis and Wolf) and ORNL (Richardsonand Wing), mortality follow-up of workers who were first hired between 1947 and 1972 (ORNL)or 1974 (Y-12) was completed through 1990. Of the 14,095 ORNL workers in the study, 3,269(23%) had died through 1990. Of the 10,620 Y-12 workers in the study, 8,119 had only worked atY-12 and 1,861 (23%) of these workers had died through 1990. A minimum of 16,000 Y-12 andORNL workers first employed between 1947 and 1974 were alive in 1990. Assuming andadditional 25% have died since 1990, approximately 11,550 workers first hired between 1947 and1974 at Y-12 and ORNL should still be alive. This figure doesn't include ex-workers first hiredafter 1974 but not employed long enough to be pensioned. This number is not known.Given these data, a reasonable provisional range of the numbers of living ex-workersfrom Y- 12 and X- 10 is 12,000 to 20,000. Given the incompleteness of information available atpresent, the estimate of the size of the population at risk must be regarded as approximate. It is,however, sufficient for planning purposes. 18

IV. NEED FOR MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE AND RISK COMMUNICATIONThe results of the 12 month needs assessment study support the need for a medicalmonitoring and risk communication program. This conclusion is based on the evidence that largenumbers of workers had exposures to detrimental agents, the strong need expressed by formerworkers for a credible targeted program of medical surveillance and education, and specificepidemiologic studies at Y-12 and ORNL that document excess risk of selected diseases.In Phase II, we propose to develop and implement a health protection and riskcommunication program for Y- 12 and ORNL workerscentered on the workers at risk for 1)chronic respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and thepneumoconioses, 2) cancer, including lung cancer 3) kidney, liver and neurologic disease, and 4)hearing loss. We select these conditions, because they meet the criteria established by the DOEfor medical monitoring and risk communication. Our logic is two-fold. First, these diseases arecaused by exposures that have occurred at Y-12 and ORNL. Second, a medical monitoringprogram framed around these conditions can provide tangible benefits. It can lead to earlydetection of cancer, which can increase survival and quality of life. A well-designed program canidentify COPD and the pneumoconioses for which advice about proper treatment (COPD),vaccinations, and prompt treatment of superimposed infections will be highly beneficial. Lungcancer is amenable to early detection through rational screening, and can be complemented bysmoking cessation programs, thereby reducing both occupational and non-occupational risks. Theseverity of kidney, liver, and neurologic disease can be reduced by control of other risk factors(e.g. —hypertensionand alcohol consumption).The risk communication will be a centerpiece of a health protection/medical monitoringprogram. While there remains considerable uncertainty about the health risks experienced as aresult of working at Y-12 and ORNL, this uncertainty must be openly communicated by crediblesources. In combination with a medical surveillance program designed to protect health, accurateinformation about risks will be itself health promoting. We propose the hard outcomes notedabove for medical monitoring, in part, because they can be identified with certainty. The healthoutcomes that we seek to include a monitoring program are highly amenable to screening on apopulation basis. After participation in the screening program, former and current Y-12 andORNL workers will have increased real knowledge about their personal health status, what isknown about their risks, and how they can promote their own health. In conclusion, mountingsuch a program in Phase II should make a tangible improvement in people's lives. 19

Section V. Exposure Assessment

--- Page 25 ---
0 IntroductionThe purpose of this one-year study was to identify primary worker exposures thatoccurred over time at the X-1O and Y-12 facilities in Oak Ridge. These exposures werecharacterized, to the extent possible, to allow for a means of determination of workerpopulations at greatest risk. A central part of the exposure assessment included the use ofbuilding specific risk mapping. This approach allowed for input directly from thoseinvolved historically at each building or area of interest. This risk mapping process alsoallowed the researchers to gain a great deal of insight on day-to-day operations andexposures that took place at these sites through time.2.0 Description of the Sitesx-10 The original X- 10 facility consisted of the air-cooled graphite pile or reactor forproducing plutonium, a pilot plant for isolating plutonium, and some support facilities.The chemical separations pilot plant construction started in March, and the reactor wentcritical and began operation November 4,1943. The site was initially challenged withseveral major goals including:1. Conduct the necessary studies and develop a workable and dependable method forchemically separating and isolating plutonium from uranium metal and fromfission products.2. Develop a process for recovering the partially depleted uranium metal that hadbeen irradiated and used in the development work at the pilot plant.3. Develop methods for producing certain other radioisotopes such as barium andlanthanum for use at other Manhattan project sites.The first major facility constructed at Clinton Laboratories, X-10 site, was the graphitereactor for irradiating uranium and producing plutonium. The second major facilityconstructed was the pilot plant (now Building 3019 but formerly Building 205) where theprocess for separating and purifying plutonium was to be testedAfter the original mission X-10 continued to do research, pilot plant work and productionwork in the areas of isotope production, isotope separation and purification, and reactorresearch. Detailed descriptions of the primary buildings and operations for the X- 10 siteare outlined in Section 5.0 of this report.Y-12 SiteThe Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant was built for the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1943 as partof the Manhattan Project under the name Clinton Engineer Works. Tennessee Eastman, asubsidiary of the Eastman Kodak Company, was the original Y-12 site contractor underthe agreement with the Army Corps of Engineers. In 1947 the oversight of the operationswere turned over to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and Tennessee Eastmanv-i

Company was replaced as the primary contractor by Carbide and Carbon ChemicalCorporation Union Carbide took over in 1957 and Martin Manetta Energy Systems(MMES) and Lockheed Martin took over in 1984 until 1999. The current contractorBWXT took over in 1999.The Y-12 plant had five principal responsibilities: 1) Development of theelectromagnetic separation process for uranium, 2) Production of nuclear weaponcomponents, 3) Fabrication support to nuclear weapon design agencies, 4) Support for theORNL, and 5) Support to other government agencies and facilities. The major programsand activities at the Y-12 site are listed in Table 1Table 1.

0 METHODOLOGYTo best summarize the exposures at the X-1O and Y-12 facilities three basic approacheswere initiated: 1) Risk Mapping of Priority Facilities and Buildings, 2) ExposuresRecords Review and Assessment, and 3) Development and Dissemination of aQuestionnaire to former workers. The approach to each of these items is detailed withinthis section.3.1 Risk MappingRisk Mapping is an approach that has been used extensively at industrial facilities as atool to assist workers and/or joint health and safety committees in determining high-riskareas within their facilities. Traditionally the technique is used to identify currentproblem areas within a facility and to assist in developing an intervention strategy forresolving the problem areas. (Parker-Brown, 1995, LOSH, 1996) For this project the riskmapping approach was used to map past exposure conditions at the identified priorityfacilities and the priority buildings within those facilities.In addition to using the mapping process for mapping past exposure conditions within thebuildings of interest, the method was also modified to allow the field researchers tocollect semi-quantitative exposure data for each identified exposure of concern. Inaddition, the field researchers were also tasked with collecting data regardingbuilding/process characteristics (i.e., description of major processes, number of workersin the building of interest, years of operation, etc.).Several steps were necessary in developing and running the risk mapping sessions. Thesteps were as follows:1) CPS, Inc. customized the risk mapping method for use in retrospective exposureassessment. Part of customizing the risk-mapping tool included the development of a"job exposure information sheet" which was used to collect job/process/exposureinformation for each chemical / agent identified on the risk map. (see Attachment 1)In addition, a "Building Characteristics Report Form" was developed to allow thefield researchers to collect descriptive information on the building of interest (i.e.,description of major processes, number of workers, years of operation, etc.). (seeAttachment 2)2) CPS, Inc. in conjunction with the PACE International Union staff developed atraining guidebook for use in training the field researchers in the technique. Theguidebook was constructed to include baseline information regarding the project aswell as basic information regarding medical surveillance.3) CPS, Inc. in conjunction with the PACE International Union conducted a train thetrainer for the field researchers. The field researchers for this project included ATLCHealth and Safety representatives. The train the trainer session was a four hour V-3

--- Page 28 ---
session to familiarize the field research team with the risk mapping methodology andfocus group techniques.4) Selection of "experts" for initial risk mapping session for the X-1O and Y-12facilities was done by CPS, Inc. in coordination with the PACE International alongwith the ATLC Local Union research teams. The "experts" selected for the initialsession consisted of hourly workers as well as salary workers (including linesupervisors) with extensive experience at the site. While the group did not consist ofa typical expert panel which might be assembled by researchers in order tocharacterize past exposures at an industrial site, the group had a vast amount of siteexperience and was selected to encompass a broad array of job classifications,facilities, and process buildings of interest.5)Theinitial risk mapping session focused on the entire site (X-1O and Y-12 separately)and was conducted to assist in determining priority areas for future, more specific,risk mapping sessions. As a product from each of these sessions, the expert groupproduced a listing of the primary facilities of concern with respect to occupationalexposures at Y-12 and X-1O. These lists, along with information obtained throughreview of previous research studies, were used to identify areas for future riskmapping sessions.6) Building specific risk mapping sessions were conducted for priority buildings at eachof the facilities. These risk mapping sessions allowed for the collection of theaforementioned data sheets: Job Exposure Information Sheet and the BuildingCharacteristics Report.7) The Job Exposure Information Sheet data along with information from the BuildingCharacteristics Reports were compiled into a database to allow for assessment of thedata. Appendix A includes a summary of the results collected during the riskmapping sessions. The data sheets indicate exposures by building and by job title.3.2 Exposure Records Review and AssessmentThe primary focus of this preliminary exposure assessment was to determine majorexposures as a function of building / area, department, or job classification. Anotherprimary need is to establish an approach for linking the building / exposure data to anindividual within the former worker roster.The major types of information used in the development of this report include: X-1O andY-12 External and Internal Radiation Databases (requested from thesites; not yet received)2. X-1O and Y-12 lET Air Sampling Data (requested; not yet received); includingY12 Beryllium, Thorium, Mercury and Uranium data3.

The availabledatabases related to external and internal exposures were analyzed to determine thosedepartments with a greater potential for external and internal radiation exposures.Generally, the data was reviewed to determine the departments with the greatest v-S

percentage of positive values. This analysis is detailed in Appendix B. Also included inthis appendix are the query files used to make the assessments.There are several notable limitations of the radiation data available including: there is noexternal data available for Y-12 workers prior to 1960, available data is based on sitepolicy of who was potentially exposed which therefore greatly limits this analysis, thedata in the database is annual summary data for individuals (not individual film badgeexposure period readings and no hard copy records were reviewed), the data usually didnot indicate building (only listing department or division), department numbers may notnecessarily be associated with a work location therefore complicating the analysis, etc.Other data files which were reviewed preliminarily to assist in the interpretation of theradiation dose records and H&S report references include: Site Specific JobClassification database, X-10 Building Number and Building Names Database, and X-10Department Number, Department Name, and Division Names (see Appendix C).Another key source that was used to supplement the risk mapping data with regard toexposures other than radiation was the H&S summary reports. These reports, whilevarying in usefulness over time, included very useful summary information with regardto the following: IH monitoring data, occurrence frequency (sometimes by building), andradiation dose summary information which was to some extent used to validate thedatabase records, A summary of some of the data (air sampling, urine, and occurrencereport data) from the available H&S reports is included in Appendix D.3.3 Questionnaire for Former WorkersA questionnaire was developed by CPS, Inc. and Queens College to survey formerworkers regarding health status, health care needs, work history, and exposureinformation A pilot questionnaire regarding the exposure information was used duringthe risk mapping activities Approximately 70 individuals completed a questionnaire(which did not include any personal identifiers — name,SSN, badge number). Analysis of the preliminary data is included in Appendix E The individuals represented thefollowing job titles for Y-12: Machinists (12), Outside Machinists (2), ChemicalOperators (5),Electroplaters(3), Pipefitters (2), Boiler Maker (2), Painter (2), Insulator(2), Welder (1), Electrician (3), Utility Operator (3), Carpenter (1), Supervisors (2), andno job title (1). The individuals represented the following job titles for X-1O: ChemicalTechnicians (7), Machinists (5), LaboratoryTechnicians (3), Laboratory Supervisors (2),Electroplater (1), Health Physicist (1), Tank Farm Operator (1), Group Leader (1),Pipefitter (1), Electrician (1), Millwright (2), Welder (1) and no job title (1).4.0 ResultsThe primary objective of this investigation was to identify the primary exposures thattook place over the site history at the two sites. The results of the risk mapping work areincorporated into the following section which outlines both the major operations at thesites, and where possible, at the buildings along with the primary exposures. The listing V-6

--- Page 31 ---
of the primary exposures is based primarily on the risk mapping results but issupplemented with information from database, past study results or document reviews.The CEDR database files for the Oak Ridge site (the Center for EpidemiologicalResearch —CERdata files (Cragle, 1996) were used to assess the relationship of externaland internal exposures as a function of time and department number. The assessment ofpriority departments with regard to various types of radiation exposure described is, forthe most part, based on the CER data files. In some cases, and where data was available,other sources were referenced to verify the prioritization approach. These other datasources include the Annual Health Physics Reports (available for X-10 for years from1952 —1983and for Y-12 for the years from 1950 — 1962(Davis, Hart, Snyder, andTurner and Y-12 (50-62), and the CEDR Mortality study data files (Richardson, 1998).For X-10 departments with greater potential for internal radiation exposure were assessedbased on the urinalysis data along with the in-vivo monitoring records. Selectedradionuclides included in the urinalysis data were assessed to determine areas(departments) most likely to be monitored for the selected radionuclide of interest.Again, it must be stressed that this analysis is limited since it does not address thoseindividuals that were not monitored and assumes that the site selection of those most atrisk for potential internal exposures was appropriate throughout the site history.Departments with greater than approximately 10% of the total samples of selectedradionuclides of interest are noted in the table below.Radionuclide Department NumberStrontium-90 3370, 3078, 3390Plutonium-239 (PuO and Pu9) 3370, 3390, 3602Gross Alpha 3370, 3290Uranium-234 3370, 3470, 3290Curium-244 3370, 3602Tritium 3602, 3369Aggregate of selected radionuclides 3604, 3079, 3193, 3405, 3325, 3675, 3078,3390, 3003, 3470, 3650 Reviewing the In-vivo records, which are associated with type of in-vivo monitoring,division, and HP Area (Building). The priority divisions and buildings based on thereview of this data are as follows: Buildings: 2016, 3001, 3019, 3038, 3517, 3550, 4500,5500, 7900, and 7920 and Divisions: Analytical Chemistry, Chemical Technology,Health Physics, Isotopes, Operations, and Plant and Equipment. v-7

Reviewing the External dose records for X-10 to determine departments with greaterpotential for exposure was done by determining the departments with more than 10% oftotal records for annual doses greater than 500 mrem. Using this approach the followingdepartments were identified: 3650, 3390, 3370, 3363, 3360, 3193, 3078, 3X, and 3CFor Y-12 the greater potential for radiation exposure was based on External Dose(including analysis of gamma, beta and neutron dose summary data) greater than 500mrem and analysis of the urinalysis data to determine the departments with greater than10% of total samples The priority departments based on review of the external dose data(penetrating, skin, and neutron) include: 2018, 2617, 2619, 2703, 2618, and 2702.For Y-12 urine data the highest 5% of all samples were reviewed and departments withgreater than 10% of the total were selected as high potential for internal exposures.Based on this criteria the following departments were identified: 2014, 2015, 2077,2158, 2230, 2301, 2617, 2618, 2619, 2638, 2687, 2702, 2776, 2791, 2793, and 5001. Ofthese departments it appears that 2617, 2618 and 2619 are the departments with thehighest potential This was deduced by reviewing the top 2% of all samples and noticingthat these three departments accounted for 35%, 17% and 9% of the samples respectively.Other exposures of interest that were used to prioritize locations, departments, divisions,or jobs to be prioritized for screening included: Beryllium, Mercury, Caustics (NitricAcid, FIF, Lithium compounds), Solvents (Carbon Tetrachloride, perchloroethylene,Acetonitrile, TCE), Asbestos, and Noise. Each of these chemicals or classes is discussedin detail in Section 7 0 The table below summarizes the departments, divisionsbuildings or job classifications that likely had high potential for exposure to each of theseagents.Chemical I Agent or Class Department, Building, Division, or jobBeryllium Machinists, Buildings (Alpha-5, 9202, Alpha-3,9995, 9766, 9998, Beta-4, 9733, and 9215 and 3019,ORNL Reactor Buildings, and 3012?)Mercury Buildings (Alpha-2,4,5, Beta-4, 9202, 4501, 8 1-10)and Departments (2025, 2026, 2681, 2682, 2683,2685, and 2690)Caustics (Nitric Acid, HF, Lithium Compounds) Buildings (3019, 9212, 9215, 3505, Beta-2,4,Alpha-5, 9292, 9203, 9206, and 940 1-2)Solvents (Carbon Tetrachioride, TCE, Acetonitrile,Perchloroethylene)Buildings (9202, 9203, Beta-2, 9205, 9212, 9215,3019, 3505, 3508 and all machine shops)Asbestos Maintenance departmentsNoise Maintenance and Operations departments V-8

0 X-10 Buildings5.1 2026 Radioactive Materials Analytical Labs (RMAL) (1964 -BuildingDescriptionThe Radioactive Materials Analytical Laboratory (RMAL) receives, stores, assaysand disposes of a wide variety of radioactive materials. Assay operations includeddissolutions, dilutions, separations, followed by physical, chemical and radiochemicalexaminations of individual samples.The RMAL facility was constructed in 1964 (with additions in 1966 and 1985) for thepurpose of providing a laboratory for general analytical chemistry for radioactivematerials and specifically to support the processing and examination of spent reactorfuel.This building housed general radioactive material analytical laboratories and six hotcells with an unloading cell in the center of the building. The building also had twolabs with glovebox operations for high level alpha work. (ORNL, 1997(a))Primary ExposuresThe primary exposures reported during risk mapping sessions included: fissionproducts, tritium. Other potential exposures of interest include: Carbon-14, Cobolt-60, Nickel-63, Srontium-90, Cesium- 134,137, Europium- 152,154,155, Thorium-228,229,232, Uranium-233 ,234,23 5,238, Neptunium-237, Plutonium-238,239,240,241,242, Americium-24 1,243, Curium-243,244,245,246 andCalifornium-249,25 1.5.2 2525 Research Shops ("Green Door Machine Shop") (1957)Building DescriptionUltrasonic Machining, Electrical Discharge Machining, Metal Evaporation, Grinding,Plastics and Rubber work, a Welding Shop and a Plating shop.

--- Page 34 ---
Building DescriptionThe Clinton Pile has been known by various names, including the X-Pile and theORNL Graphite Reactor. The term 'pile' was used to describe the reactor because itwas assembled by piling up blocks of graphite with pieces of uranium interspersed.In the pile the graphite served as the neutron moderator, slowing the neutrons to allowfurther reaction with the fissionable Uranium-235 to produce a chain reaction. Thepile was a 24 foot graphite block with holes or channels for the fuel or for experimentports. The entire cube was surrounded by a 7 foot thick concrete shield. The reactorwas air cooled and originally the exhaust was not filtered. The reactor first wentcritical in the fall of 1943. (ChemRisk, 1993)Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported during risk mapping sessions included: Plutonium,Internal radiation, External Radiation, Iodine-131, Strontium-90, Colbalt-60, Curium-244, and asbestos. It was mentioned that the Building 3019 1959 Plutonium incidentcontaminated building 3001 (which is situated across the road from building 3019).5.4 3005 LITR (1952 —1968)Building DescriptionThe LITR was originally built to be a small mock-up or training facility to test thedesign of the controls and hydraulics of the MTR reactor. This facility served as atraining ground for the operators of the full scale facility (Phillips Petroleumpersonnel from MTR in INEL were trained in this facility). This facility was used asan experimental reactor until 1968. (ChemRisk, 1997) (Stapleton, 1993)Primary ExposuresThe primary exposures noted for this building during risk mapping sessions included:External radiation, internal radiation, and neutron exposures.5.5 MTR Materials Test Reactor (1946 — 1948)The MTR was a high flux reactor that had the chief function of intense neutronbombardment for testing materials to be used in future reactors. The main features ofthe reactor were parallel uranium fuel plates between aluminum plates, with waterused as the moderator and the coolant and with beryllium used as a reflector. Aftera short testing period the MTR design and function was moved to Idaho (INEL).5.6 Daniels Pile (1946 —1948)A reactor designed with a bed of enriched uranium 'pebbles' moderated by berylliumoxide and cooled by helium gas. This experimental 'pebble bed' reactor was only in v-b

--- Page 35 ---
operation until 1948. Further research in this area was shifted to Argonne NationalLabs.5.7 3010 Bulk Shielding Building (1950 — 1991)Building DescriptionThe Bulk Shielding Reactor was originally built to support the Aircraft NuclearPropulsion (ANP) project. Much of the focus of the project was to develop effectivebut lightweight shielding which would protect both the flight crew and the equipment.The BSR was a swimming pooi reactor in which the enriched uranium core wassubmerged in water for both cooling and neutron moderation, and could be movedaround in the concrete pool to test bulk shielding materials in various configurations.The BSR was upgraded (BSF-ll reactor — 1960-1991) to include a forced coolingsystem and took over the function of the general purpose research reactor for thefacility (replaced the graphite reactor which was shut down at the same time).(Stapleton, 1993)Primary ExposuresThe primary exposures noted for this building during risk mapping sessions included:External radiation, internal radiation, and neutron exposures.5.8 3Ol2Rolling Mill (1947 —late70s)Building DescriptionThis was the primary production plant for the fuel elements for all reactors. Thefacility also performed work for SRS and the Navy as well as fuel tubes for the HFIRin the late 70s.Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported included: Uranium, beryllium, aluminum, zirconium,solvents, External Radiation, and Internal Radiation.5.9 3019 Separations Building (1943 - 1991)(originally Building 205)Building DescriptionThe original purpose of Building 3019 (the Pilot Plant) was to test processes forplutonium separation, determine needs for full scale production level separation, andprovide plutonium for other sites to use for evaluation purposes. When it wasconstructed it included 6 large underground cells. (Brooksbank, 1994) One of themost significant incidents involving an explosion in an evaporator cell in Buildingv-il

--- Page 36 ---
3019 occurred in 1959. The explosion resulted in a release of plutonium out of thebuilding and into building 3001 (across the street) Risk mapping participantsreported that subsequent to this accident health physics practices were improved.(Parrot, 1961, and Morgan, 1959)Significant Processes or Pilot Operations in the 3019 ComplexBismuth Phosphate Process (1943 — 1945)The first process selected for separation was the Bismuth phosphate co-precipitationprocess. The fuel slugs came directly from the Graphite reactor (3001) through acanal that ran between the buildings. The fuel was allowed to cool (decay of the shortlived fission products) prior to being brought into the Pilot plant. The process wasconducted in six hot cells within Building 205 (later Building 3019) The slugs werefirst dissolved in a solution of nitric acid with a mercury catalyst (to remove thealuminum casing) The uranium was dissolved in a heated mtnc acid bath By theend of January 1944, 113 ton per day of irradiated fuel from the reactor was goingthrough the pilot plant, although the low pile power level and short operating timehad not allowed the plutonium concentration to build up to the planned levels.(Genung, 1993) Eventually the plutonium was separated by adding bismuth nitrateand phosphoric acid creating bismuth phosphate which carried the plutonium out ofsolution The fission product decontamination factors for the plutonium separationswere terrible resulting in high levels of fission products in the product.Redox 25 Process (1946 —1948)The Redox process was a solvent extraction process for separation and purification ofplutonium and uranium. Solvent extraction methods take advantage of the fact thatnitrates of plutonium and uranium are readily soluble in certain organic liquids, whilethe nitrates of fission products are generally insoluble in these liquids. The Redoxprocess, which used methyl isobutyl ketone (hexone) as the organic solvent andaluminum nitrate in the aqueous phase to improve separation, was anticipated to besimpler and more economical than the bismuth phosphate precipitation process, but atfirst it yielded uranium of insufficient purity.The "25" Process was designed to recover the highly enriched uranium from useduranium aluminum alloy fuel elements from the MTR in Idaho. This process was thepredecessor to the Idaho chemical plant process.Purex Process (1949 —1960)The PUREX process (Plutonium Uranium Reduction Extraction Process) wasdeveloped on a pilot scale starting in 1949. The Purex process used solventextraction with tributyl phosphate (TBP) in Varsol (organic diluent) and nitric acid asa salting agent. They also experimented with TBP in Amsco 123-15 hydrocarbondiluent (kerosene) The uranium was isolated as UNH andafter an ion exchangeprocess the Plutonium was isolated as Plutonium nitrate (Pu(N03)4). In addition to V-12

--- Page 37 ---
isolating plutonium and uranium, the Purex process also isolated fission productisotopes of zirconium, niobium, and ruthenium (by distilling off the nitric acid for re-use).In addition to the purex process ORNL also developed an ion-exchange plutoniumisolation method and a process for recovering plutonium from metallurgical wastes.In 195 1-1953 the Purex process was conducted on a continuous process (rather thanbatch processing) with a total of 34 runs being conducted (each run withapproximately 140 slugs (—250 kg)). The Purex process was subsequently run in full-scale operation at the Hanford facilityFrom 1950 through 1960 the Purex process was used on varying feed materialsincluding Uranium slugs, NRX reactor fuel, SRP fuel, BNL reactorfuel, SRPUranium slugs, and CP-2 reactor fuel The materials recovered included Uranium-233, Uranium-235, Plutonium-239, and Plutonium-240 Among the fission products,cerium, zirconium, niobium, ruthenium, and iodine tend to be extracted along withthe products and are most difficult to separate from uranium, plutonium and thorium.(Bruce, 1956)Prior to using the TBP based solvent extraction processes other solvents had beeninvestigated including: pentaether, diisopropyl ether, tertiary alcohols, dibutylcellosolve, theonyl trifluoroacetone, and dibutyl carbitol. (Genung, 1993)Thorex Process (1954 —1960and 1969 —1976)Thorex process is similar to the Purex process and is used for separating thorium anduranium Used diethylbenzene instead of kerosene and a different solvent replacingTBP. The early runs were performed on Thorium slugs and later the process wasused to recover U-233 from U-23302-Th02 hard scrap Significant forms ofradioactive material encountered in the Thorex processing were Protactinium-233 andRuthenium Ruthenium was observed to be a limiting fission product contaminant inthe Thorex process, with levels higher during short decay runs. The separation ofProtactinium-233, while unsuccessful, was a significant contributor to radiation levelsand particulate releases. Because of concerns with personnel exposures in thefacility, the short-decay runs were terminated (around 1957) (Genung, 1993,ChemRisk, 1997) A 1958 Health and Safety report indicated airborne levels up to1 .7E-8 microcuries per cubic centimeter beta and gamma radioactivity was measuredat a laboratory area air monitoring station during a short decay run. This value wasapproximately 2000 times higher than the annual average of weekly data from theperimeter monitors during 1957. (Hart, 1958)Intenm-23 Process (1954 —1958)The Interim-23 Process (INT-23) was developed to isolate Uranium-233 alone fromthorium and associated fission products INT-23 was used to isolate kilogram V-13

--- Page 38 ---
quantities of Uranium-233 for weapons applications from Hanford irradiated slugs.The goal of the process was to recover U-233 with very little U-232 (<5ppm)(ChemRisk, 1997)Fluoride Volatility Process (1958 — 1968)The fluoride volatility process was developed to take advantage of the high volatilityof UF6toseparate uranium from less volatile fluoride salts. The process wasdeveloped to recover Uranium-235 from molten salt reactor fuels and from other fuelssoluble in molten salt. The process was used from 1949 — 1968in Building 3019,including the reprocessing of molten salt reactor experiment fuel and uranium-zirconium alloy fuels containing highly enriched uranium.Kilorod Process (1960 —1964)The Kilorod facility was constructed within Building 3019 in the early 1960s to dodevelopment work on the reprocessing and fabrication of fuels containing Thoriumand Uranium-233. This process development work was performed in Cell 4 ofBuilding 3019. The processing of the fuel in the Kilorod facility involved twodistinct phases —bulkoxide preparation by the sol-gel process and fuel rodfabrication The fuel rod fabncation included the following steps 1) sizing the bulkU02-Th02 into an optimum particle size distribution (using crushing operations, ballmill operations and classifiers) for vibratory compaction, 2) vibratory compaction, 3)welding of the final end closure, 4) fuel rod decontamination, and 5) fuel rodinspection. Mockups of various parts of the process were designed in Building 4508.Cold runs using depleted Uranium were conducted to determine the adequacy of theprocess. A total of 37 kilograms of Uranium-233 was recovered during the Kilorodprogram. 1100 fuels rods charged with 3% Uranium-23302- 97% Th02. (Sease,1964)Head End Processes (1955 — 1976)(ChemRisk, 1997)Shear Leach ProcessThe Shear Leach Process consistsof shearing stainless steel or Zircaloy clad tubularU02 bearing fuel elements and leaching the U02 from the sheared fuel tube withnitric acid in preparation for solvent extraction.Darex ProcessThe Darex process was developed for stainless steel-jacketed fuels and used a mixtureof boiling hydrochloric and nitric acid (aqua regia) to dissolve the stainless steeljacket. V-14

--- Page 39 ---
Sulfex ProcessAn alternate process for stainless steel-jacketed fuels was the Sulfex process thatdissolved the stainless steel jacket in sulfuric acid and the fuel materials in nitric acid.This was only run on a pilot scale at ORNL.Zirfiex ProcessZirfiex was a similar process as Sulfex for Zirconium jacketed fuel using ammoniumfluorideammonium nitrate solution to dissolve the zirconium jacket followed by nitricacid dissolution of the core. Such procedures were especially applicable to fuels withuranium and thorium oxide cores.Feed Materials Processing (1953 — 1959)Excer ProcessThe uranyl nitrate product of solvent extraction processes (Redox, Purex) is convertedto UF4 in preparation for gaseous diffusion recycle as UF6. This was usuallyaccomplished by costly reduction with hydrogen and HF. The Excer processinvolved aqueous phase hydrofluorination of uranium to UF4. A modification, theExcer Moving Bed Process, for converting uranyl nitrate to IJF4 consisted ofdenitration of the uranyl nitrate to U03, reduction to U02, and hydrofluorination toUF4.Fluorox ProcessThe Fluorox process involved reaction of UF4 with oxygen to produce UF6 anduranyl fluoride.Metallex ProcessThe Metallex process for conversion of thorium tetrachloride to thorium metal ingotsinvolves dissolving thorium tetrachloride in anhydrous propylene diamine (PDA) andreducing the thorium by contact with sodium or lithium amalgam. A button ofthorium metal is formed by filtering, cold pressing, and melting the metallic product.Raw materials ProcessingThe discovery that certain solvents and reagents could extract uranium from thesulfate solutions that were used to leach uranium from ores was an importanttechnological achievement. The Dapex process used dialkyl phosphoric acid for bothuranium and vanadium recovery. The Amex process uses a long-chain alkyl aminefor uranium recovery. The Monex process used TBP to extract thorium from processsludge and leach. The Slurrex process was developed in 1950 when the AECrequested ORNL to make a preliminary evaluation of various solvents for recovery V-15

--- Page 40 ---
and purification of uranium from ore concentrates. Ethyl ether had been used for thisprocess in the past. The Slurrex process using TBP was developed by ORNL incollaboration with Mallinckrodt Chemical Works and the Catalytic ConstructionCompany. The process consisted of extraction of nitric acid slurries of uranium orewith 30% TBP, scrubbing with hot water, and stripping the uranium with equalvolumes of hot water. This process was used on a production level at Fernald.3019 Primary ExposuresThe primary exposures for this building included: Hydraulic fluids, Internalradiation, External Radiation, Fluorides, IJF6, HF, Beryllium, Heat, Asbestos, PCBs,Nitric Acid, Aluminum Nitrate, TBP, Amsco (Kerosene), Plutonium, Thorium, liEU,and Uranium-233.According to risk mapping participants in 1959 three of the worst accidents at ORNLwere in 3019: explosion, Ruthenium exposure, and explosion resulting in release ofplutonium. Additionally, H&S reports reviewed indicate that Building 3019 had themajority of the reported occurrences on the X-10 site for the years from 1960 — 1964(see Appendix D).5.10 Central Machine Shop ("Bee Bee Shop") (1947 — 1961)Building DescriptionBuilding 3024 was the general machine shop before building 2525 was built. Thebuilding was intended to be a clean shop but reportedly got more and morecontaminated over the years. It was nicknamed the "Bee Bee" shop because of thework done with lead shot. At the height of operations the shop had about 50 peopleworking there.Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported for the building included: Lead, internal radiation,external radiation, Noise, welding fumes, mercury, solvents, and beryllium (smallamount). (Risk Mapping and Bingham, 1997)5.11 3026 C By-product Process Building and Chemistry Separation Lab (1943Building DescriptionOne primary process that was conducted in Building 3026 was the separation ofradioactive lanthanum from irradiated fuel. Radioactive Lanthanum-140 was used inweapons test devices in order to characterize the movements of parts after theexplosion through the monitoring of the very intense gamma radiation from theLanthanum. The Radioactive Lanthanum (RaLa) process involved large quantities ofirradiated fuel in which radioactive fission products had been allowed to decay for V-16

--- Page 41 ---
only a short period of time. The processing also initially took place at a time whenradioactive gases that were released were not efficiently trapped.The irradiated uranium slugs would be transferred to the 706-D (later 3026) dissolverapproximately 1-5 days after irradiation. Based on 150 pounds of slugs in adissolving batch, one reference indicates that 2500 curies of Xenon-133, 1300 curiesof Iodine-131, and less than 1 curie of Krypton-85 were released within the dissolver.RaLa runs typically involved batches of approximately 50 slugs at a time withproduction runs up to 1500 slugs. A production process was developed and put intoplace in Building 706-C where existing lab facilities were converted to the RaLaproduction process. In all, nine shipments to Los Alamos were made by 1945,totaling 3852 curies produced with the 706-C equipment which was designed for onlysmall-scale (1-10 curies) separation. (Thompson, 1949)Building 706-D was expanded to allow for increased production requirements.Separation operations in 706-D started in May of 1945 and by 1949 shipment to LosAlamos included over 62,000 curies of Barium-140. Production levels steadilyincreased from 1949 to 1954 with batch runs in 1954 resulting in as high as 64,000curies of Barium-140. Over the approximate 12 years of operation ONRL workersdissolved at least 30,000 slugs in the process of separating over 500,000 curies ofradioactive barium-lanthanum for Los Alamos weapons development and researchprojects. In 1954, after an incident at ORNL resulted in an airborne release, the RaLaoperation was re-established in Idaho Falls, Idaho.The RaLa process was very unpredictable. Because of inherent uncertainties in theoperating procedure it was impossible to maintain a fixed production schedule oreven to determine in advance exactly what materials would be required in theprocessing of a run. (Thompson, 1949)In addition to the RaLa process this building was the primary building for fissionproduct separation work.Primary ExposuresThe primary exposures identified for this building include: short decay fissionproducts, external radiation, internal radiation, coolant, NaK, Sodium Hydroxide, andasbestos.5.12 3028 Alpha Powder Facility (Curium Source Fabrication Facility) (3028E)and Short Lived Fission Product Facility (3028W)Building 3028 was constructed in 1950 to separate the short-lived fission productsfrom irradiated uranium-aluminum targets, using a concrete shielded manipulator cellon the ground floor. Labs were provided on the 2nd 3rd and 4th floors. The buildingwas later expanded by the addition of a single-story wing on the east side to house thealpha powder handling operations. The building was used to process curie quantities V-17

of short lived fission products and to package and distribute gram quantities of alphamaterials such as oxides of Americium-241 and 243, Curium-244, Neptunium-237and Plutonium-238. 3028-B Hot Cells (1-4) were highly contaminated with alphacontamination with levels reported to be 1E6 -> 1E7dpmIlOO cm2 (Schaich, 1964).Primary exposuresPrimary exposures reported during risk mapping sessions included: Curium-244,Strontium-90, Cesium-137, and Cobalt-60 Other radionuclides of interest includeShort Lived Fission Products (Xenon-133, Iodine-131, Molybdenum-99, Zirconium-95, Tellurium-132, Ruthenium-103), Amencium-241,243, Curium-242, Neptunium-237, Plutonium-238, 239 240, 241, 242, Uranium-232, 233, 235 236 (Schaich,1964, 1970)5.13 3029-3038 Radioisotope Area (1951) (Goldsmith, 1987, 1988)3029 Source Development LaboratoryBuilding 3029 was constructed to perform the chemical and mechanical processing ofnumerous radioisotopes into radiation sources. The SDL was used to prepare sourcesof Strontium-90, Cesium- 137, Promethium- 147, Cobalt-60, Iridium- 192, Iodine- 131,Technetium-99, Calcium-47 and short lived radioisotopes. A subterranean Cobalt-60storage and irradiation facility (Cobalt-60 Garden) is used to store Cobalt-60 and toirradiate specimens with high gamma fluxes. Chemical, physical, and mechanicalprocessing of radioactive materials is conducted in four manipulator hot cells, twolaboratory hoods used as glove boxes and small glove boxes.3030, 3031, 3032 Radioisotope Development LabThe RDL are located in three separate single-story buildings (3030, 3031, 3032). Thelabs were constructed to perform limited production and development work withradioisotope materials used for industrial, medical and research applications.The hot cell in Building 3030 is used to process irradiated cyclotron and reactortargets to produce numerous unique radioisotopes, such as: 1) Cobalt-56 recoveryfrom an iron target, 2) Cobalt-57 from a Nickel cyclotron target, 3) preparation ofpurified Gold-198 solution, 4) separation of Neptunium-234 from a uranium target,5) preparation of purified Strontium-90 nitrate, and purification of Uranium-237.The hot cell in Building 3031 is used in the final separation of gadolinium fromcontaminated Europium targets. The Gadolinium-153 is used for nuclear medicine.Building 3032 was a hooded laboratory operation where only low-level radioisotopeproduction technology research and development activities were conducted. v-i 8

Building 3033A Actinide Fabrication Laboratory (AFL)Building 3033 Annex was constructed in 1960 by bridging the space betweenBuildings 3033 and 3034. Until 1973 a portion of the building was used in theproduction of Carbon-14. The facility was later used to produce, load, weld, anddecontaminate neutron dosimeters and to weigh and package milligram to gramquantities of actinide materials. The facility was also used to fabricate ceramic oxidewire.3036 Decontamination Building (1951)Building DescriptionOne of the primary tasks performed in this building was the decontamination of leadwhich was subsequently sent it to lead shop (building 7005). Decontaminated leadbricks by dipping in nitric acid. Risk mapping participants mentioned that the "HPswere coming up with high lead levels in their medical montirong".Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported include: Lead, Nitric Acid, external radiation, internalradiation.3038 Alpha Handling Facility (AHF) and Isotope Research Materials Lab(IRML)The Isotopes Alpha Handling Facility was used for studying the physical andchemical characteristics of transuranium elements, fabrication of alpha and neutronemitting targets and sources, and fabrication of beta and low-energy gamma sources.Building 3038 was constructed in 1948 to house all the radioisotope shippingactivities for ORNL In the original configuration, the entire facility was dedicated topackaging, testing, shipping and receiving of all radioactive materials handled atORNL The east portion of the building was used as an analytical lab to performlocal analysis of short-lived radioisotopes prior to shipment. The central portion ofthe building contained the concrete barricade for the storage of liquid and solidradioactive materials, a pipetting station for the transfer of liquids, the canningstation, a material transfer system, a remote manipulator, and overhead mirrors toprovide observation behind the barricade. The west area was used for packaging,labeling, and inspection.By the late 1960s the volume of isotope shipping had decreased and the west portionwas converted to the Alpha Handling Facility. The AHF used five water shielded,manipulator cells to handle alpha and neutron emitters and three glove boxes used tofabricate alpha targets and sources. A separate glove box room (AHF annex) wasused to weigh, package and weld capsules of actinide materials. (Schaich, 1970) v-i 9

It was cooled and moderated by water, with beryllium andwater providing the necessary neutron reflection. It used uranium aluminum alloyfuel in a core that was cooled with high velocity water. The entire core tank wasimmersed in a water pooi. The ORRR had beam ports extending through the concretepooi and also had the ability to do experiments in the water in close proximity to thecore to attain high neutron fluxes. In addition to mteria1 and solid state physicsexperiments the ORRR was used for radionuclide production to produceradionuclides for use in research or medical applications. (ChemRisk, 1997)Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported included: External radiation, internal radiation, fissionproducts, and beryllium.5.15 3044 Special Materials Machine Shop ("Hot" Machine Shop) (1955)Building DescriptionMade fuel elements at this facility. Worked with uranium, beryllium, thorium,fiberglass and lots of graphite. This building reportedly had more restrictive PPErequirements than the 2525 machine shop. Risk mapping participants reported thatthey did "time controlled" machining to control doses. Helpers were part of theregular workforce and did the cleaning of the machines The workforce consisted ofapproximately 25-30 machinists and helpers.Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported during risk mapping included: External radiation,skin/hand radiation exposures, internal radiation, beryllium, thorium, uranium, andfiberglass.

16 3047 Radioisotope Development Laboratory (RDL)Building DescriptionBuilding 3047 was constructed in 1962 to conduct research and development and toproduce radioisotope materials. The facility had the following entities: severalgeneral-purpose labs for the handling of low-level radioactive materials, four shieldedmanipulator hot cells for high-level beta-gamma activity processing, three alpha-handling labs with one decontamination room, ten offices, a change room and storageand service areas.The four manipulator cells (Cells A, B, C, and D) located in the center of the firstfloor were used for high-level beta/gamma activities processing. These hot cells areequipped with dual, parallel HEPA filters in the rear of each cell. Access to changethese filters exposed personnel to about 600 mr/hour fields (with filter changes takingapproximately 20-30 minutes). (Goldsmith, 1987) It should be noted that for themost part manipulators used in hot cells throughout the ORNL were worked on in theManipulator shop (Building 3074).Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported during risk mapping sessions included: Irridium,Strontium, Cesium, Cobalt, Tritium, Curium, External Radiation, and InternalRadiation.5.17 3503 High Radiation Level Chemical Laboratory (1948 (originally 706-HB,-HD)In the 1950s this lab was used for chemical engineering studies of radiochemicalprocesses involving evaporation, solvent extraction and ion-exchange and continuedunit operation scale studies of the TBP process and the RaLa process.Research work on the Interim-23 Process (INT-23), developed to isolate Uranium-233 alone from thorium and associated fission products, was also performed in thisbuilding. INT-23 was used to isolate kilogram quantities of Uranium-233 forweapons applications from Hanford irradiated slugs.Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported include: Mercury (support work for Y-12 operations),TBP, Thorium, chlorinated solvents, Uranium-233, Plutonium, Strontium-90,Cesium-137, and Cobalt-60.

18 3505ReactorFuels. Processing Plant, Metals Plant (1951)Process DescriptionThe facility consists of seven process cells (A thru G), a canal, a dissolver room, adissolver pit, an office, locker room, storage area, control room, electrical gallery,shop, and makeup area.The Tributyl phosphate (TBP) process was developed in 1949 for the recovery andpurification of uranium from the metal-bearing wastes that had accumulated in theORNL tank farm from wartime processing efforts. The process used TBP as asolvent for extracting uranium and was later modified to also recover plutonium. AMetal Recovery Facility (Building 3505) wasconstructed at ORNL to use the TBPprocess to recover uranium and plutonium from fission product waste solutionscollected in the tank farm system at the ORNL. In operation since 1953 the MetalsRecovery Facility also recovered uranium and plutonium from fuel from the ChalkRiver reactor, Hanford metallurgical waste, the Brookhaven National Laboratoryreactor, Argonne Labs CP-2 and CP-3 reactors, and 7.8 tons of sand contaminated byweapons tests in Nevada. (Thompson, 1963, ChemRisk, 1997)Metal recovery processing of Hanford metallurgical wastes for recovery of plutoniumand americium began in 1954. In the first quarter of operation the process yieldedover 18 kg of plutonium. (Brooksbank)Metal recovery also recovered 127 grams of Neptunium-237 and 6.7 tons of uraniumfrom 11.2 tons of the nonvolatile fluoride 'ash' resulting from fluorination of U03 toUF6 at Paducah. (Brooksbank)In 1958 the Metal Recovery Plant was linked by underground piping to the Pilot Plant(Building 3019) to form what became known as the Power Reactor Fuel Processing(PRFP) complex.The PUREX process (Plutonium Uranium Reduction Extraction Process) wasdeveloped on a pilot scale starting in 1949. The Purex process used solventextraction with tributyl phosphate (TBP) in Varsol (organic diluent) and nitric acid asa salting agent. They also experimented with TBP in Amsco 123-15 hydrocarbondiluent (kerosene). The uranium was isolated as UNH and after an ion exchangeprocess the Plutonium was isolated as Plutonium nitrate (Pu(N03)4). In addition toisolating plutonium and uranium, the Purex process also isolated fission productisotopes of zirconium, niobium, and ruthenium (by distilling off the nitric acid for re-use).In addition to the purex process ORNL also developed an ian-exchange plutoniumisolation method and a process for recovering plutonium from metallurgical wastes. V-22

--- Page 47 ---
In 195 1-1953 the Purex process was conducted on a continuous process (rather thanbatch processing) with a total of 34 runs being conducted (each run withapproximately 140 slugs (—250 kg)). The Purex process was subsequently run in full-scale operation at the Hanford facility.Risk mapping participants indicated that building 3505 and 3019 were 'directmaintenance' facilities indicating that the cells were not designed to be maintainedremotely. This was also discussed in a technical presentation. (Bruce, 1960)According to health and safety reports the exposure of maintenance men toradioactivity in 7 years of operation averaged 60 mremlweek (approximately 3Rem/year).

Theoriginal facility consisted of a concrete pad with tanks and a tent surrounding theshield blocks. In 1950 a hot cell was added. Lean-to buildings contained theoperating areas and a small valve pit was on the north side of the building. Thisbuilding was used to extract radioisotopes of ruthenium, strontium, cesium, cerium,and other elements from the ORNL liquid wastes and the Chalk River Canada clean- V-23

up wastes. Past operations in this facility resulted in severe contamination of theinterior surfaces due primarily to a practice of intentionally overflowing the pipingand vessels with purge liquids for decontamination to allow entry for work Thisbuilding was shut down in 1976 but required continued surveillance and maintenanceuntil eventual D&D in 2003. (ORNL 1995)According to risk mapping participants management had tried to decontaminate thisbuilding in the past and the result was "burning out a bunch of people just trying tostart the cleanup operations".Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported include: External Radiation, fission products, andInternal radiation.5.21 3517 Fission Product Development Laboratory (1958 — 1988)Building DescriptionBuilding 3517 is a concrete block and corrugated aluminum sided structure. Thebuilding includes 15 cells shielded with concrete walls. In addition, there are fourcells, outside the main cell block, shielded with steel or concrete.Aqueous feed materials containing mixed fission products is concentrated byevaporation, and the fission products are then separated into groups of chemicallyrelated elements by inorganic precipitation. These purified fission products areconverted to a dried powder, which is pressed into pellets for insertion intocontainers The containers are sealed by welding and shipped to the customer for useas a source of radiation or heat.This lab worked primarily on the concentration, isolation and separation of fissionproducts from aqueous waste streams. The building houses large quantities of Sr-90and Cs-137. Risk mapping participants reported that there was an accident resultingin a severe hand dose from Strontiurn-90. The workforce consisted of four shiftsthrough the 1970s and then cut back to 3 shifts in the 80'sPrimary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported included: Transuranics, Cesium-137, Cerium-144, andStrontium-90.

In addition to machining the building housed sheet metalwork, and pipefitters. This was a High Bay facility that allowed for fairly large- scalefabrication for mock-up pilot equipment.5.28 7500 Homogeneous Reactor Experiment Building (1951)Building DescriptionHomogenous Reactor Experiment (1951 — 1954)The homogeneous reactor was called such because it combined fuel, moderator, andcoolant in one water-based solution. Homogeneous reactors had been tried earlier buthad been stopped due to technical problems including problems with corrosion. TheHRE building was completed in 1951 and achieved a one megawatt power level in V-26

--- Page 51 ---
High-pressure steam from the reactor was fed to a turbine/generator togenerate electricity. (Genung, 1993)Homogenous Reactor Test (HRE-II) (1954 — 1961)The HRE-ll reactor was designed as a two-region homogenous reactor core. The aimwas not only to produce electrical power but also to irradiate thorium surrounding thecore to produce fissionable Uranium-233. The reactor had many technical problemsduring its short pilot period with the longest continuous running period ofapproximately 100 days achieved in 1958.Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported include: External radiation, neutron exposure,5.29 7503 Reactor Experiments Building (ARE) (1952 — 1957)Building DescriptionMolten Salt Reactor (1960)Based on the success of the molten-salt ANP reactor(which was a small, hightemperature reactor engine that used circulating molten uranium salts as fuel) theORNL began to further investigate the usefulness of the technology The Molten SaltReactor (MSR) was built as a thermal breeder reactor with a molten salt Uranium-235reactor surrounded with a blanket of 'fertile' (materials that can be transformed byneutron absorption to fissionable materials) Thorium-232 contained in a moltenmixture. The Thorium-232 was transformed by neutron absorption to fissionableUranium-233. The fuel for this type of reactor was Uranium-233F4 dissolved in amolten mixture (solution) of Lithium Fluoride (Li-7) and Beryllium Fluoride (BeF2).The fertile material was ThF4 dissolved in the same salt or in a separate salt of similarcomposition.

The facility had fourdifferent reactor assemblies over its period of operation.5.31 7709 Health Physics Research Reactor (HPRR) (1960 — 1987)Building DescriptionThe IIPPR was designed to be a fast burst reactor. It was a small, unmoderated,unshielded reactor that released short bursts of neutrons ideal for health physics andbiomedical research. The small HPPR, housed in the Dosimetry ApplicationsResearch Facility (DOSAR), was contained in a steel structure, aluminum sidedbuilding which is supported by a large, track mounted positioning device. Thereactor building is located in a hollow and is surrounded by hills at least 50 feet highto provide natural shielding and to prevent 'line of sight' viewing of the reactor in anydirection, The support building was located behind the hill approximately 900 feetfrom the reactor. The reactor had been operated 3000 times in the steady state modeand 1000 times in the pulse mode.5.327852Hydrofracture FacilityBuilding DescriptionThis facility was constructed as a pilot plant to demonstrate the feasibility ofpermanent disposal of liquid radioactive waste in impermeable shale formations byhydrofracture methods.

--- Page 53 ---
placed in the trap region for intense thermal (moderated) neutron bombardment inorder to form transurnaic radionuclides including Berkehum-249, Californium-252,Einsteinium-253, and Fermium-257. In addition to production of transuranicradionculides, the HFIR has been used for many irradiation experiments usingfacilities that allow insertion of samples into the flux trap region, into the region ofthe beryllium reflector, and using beam tubes that allow neutrons to be beamed out toexperimental facilities outside the reactor shielding. (Genung, 1993, Stapelton, 1993)Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported included: External radiation, neutron exposure,transuranics,5.35 7920 Transuranium Processing Plant (TRU)Building DescriptionCame about due to the need for transuranic isotopes such as berkelium, californium,and einsteinium. The first hot processing was completed in the TRU facility (nowREDC) in November 1966. 10's to 100's or milligrams of Californium-252 wererecovered during each campaign (this material was sent to ANt andSRS). Thebuilding included 12 hot cells and 12 laboratories. The facility fabricated targets forthe HFIR and processed targets after irradiation in BIFIR to recover the isotope ofinterest Also did research on the Purex process to help determine the effectivenessof this process on very high burnup fuels. The Solvent Extraction Test facility (Purextesting) was located in Cell 5 and Tank pit 5.Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported included: Pu-240, Pu-242, Am-243, Cm-244 ,245,246,248, Cf-252, Bk-249, Es-253, and Fm-257, external radiation, andinternal radiation.5.367930Thorium-Uranium Recycle Facility (TURF)Building DescriptionDesigned to process fuels from advanced reactors.

Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported included: Plutonium, Curium, and Americium.5.37 ORNL Buildings at Y-12Several Y-12 Buildings were transferred to ORNL after the original work on Uraniumseparation. Some of the primary work conducted in these facilities included stableisotope production work. The ORNL buildings at Y-12 of interest with regard toworker exposure included: 9201-2 Thermonuclear (from Y-12 1951), 9201-3Reactor Design and Engineer Development (from Y-12 1950), 9204-1 ReactorExperimental Engineering (from Y-12 1950), 9204-3 Electronuclear Building (fromY-12 in 1951), 9213 Criticality Lab, 9207,9210 Biology Research Facilities (fromY-12 in 1947), 9731 Stable Isotope Separation (from Y-12 in 1951), and the 9995Lab (risk mapping participants felt that this facility had high chemical exposures).5.38 Other X-10 BuildingsOther buildings on the site which were not included in the Risk Mapping activitiesbut which may be of interest with regard to potential exposures include: Interim LowLevel Facility (907), Metallurgy Labs (2000), Health Physics Labs (2003), PhysicsLaboratory (2005), Health Physics Test Building (2007), Health Physics Low LevelAnalysis Lab (2008), Medical and Biological Building (2013), MetallurgyLaboratory Annex (2024), Instrument Shop (2506), Decontamination Laundry(2523),6.0 Y-12 Major Operations and Buildings6.1 Primary Processes in Alpha and Beta BuildingsThe Electromagnetic Separation ProcessThe initial mission of the Y-12 facility was the separation and enrichment of Uranium-235. This was done in cyclotron like equipment that operated much like a massspectrometer, using electromagnetic separation to isolate isotopes of interest. The unitswere called calutrons. The calutrons operating principals are basically as follows: atomsor groups of atoms are ionized and accelerated to a given electrical potential, theacceleration is stopped and then introduced into a magnetic field through which theymove at a velocity which is a function of their mass and charge. Ions are then collectedat locations that can be predicted on the basis of their size and charge.The calutron separation operation was done in two primary type of calutrons: Alphacalutrons and Beta calutrons. The alpha calutrons were the larger units and used for theinitital enrichment and the beta calutrons were the units used for "topping" or bringing aslightly enriched feed material to an enrichment suitable for the end use. V-30

--- Page 55 ---
The electromagnetic plant itself was a major instillation. At its peak it employed 24,000(50,000 indicated in abstract of same reference) workers Eventually the plant came tocontain five alpha enrichment buildings (20% U-235) and four Beta buildings (90+% U-235). Calutrons were generally arranged in continuous, oval or rectangular,arrangements, called "racetracks" Each alpha track consisted of 96 calutron tanks withelectromagnets between, arranged in an oval (alpha-i) or rectangle (alpha-2). The centerarea of the alpha-i racetracks was large enough to be used as office space by a number ofstaff members The beta tracks consisted of 36 units each, in the form of an rectanglewith a large metal "magnet keeper" across the ends The beta units were considerablysmaller than the alpha units since they were designed as a second stage to utilize thesmaller amount of product from the alpha units as a pre-enriched feed.Each group of calutrons was used as a pilot plant for succeeding generations. The alphacalutrons were primarily in two models, the alpha-i units and alpha-2 units. The alpha-iunit had two ion sources, and the alpha-2 unit, four ion sources, permitting much greaterthroughput. These are also referred to as two and four arc machines. The beta calutronshad two ion sources.The 24,000 employees consisted of the following job groups: administrative staff,support staff, calutron operators, calutron chemical recycle operators, machinists,construction staff, and scientific research staff. It was noted that "a small fraction ofElectromagnetic Plant staff, mostly restricted to the scientific staff, knew that the ClintonEngineer Works was producing material for use in weapons until after the actualHiroshima explosion" (Compere, 199i)The Electromagnetic Plant Uranium-235 operations were very short lived. In late 1944the Thermal Diffusion Plant (S-SO) began supplying low level enriched feed for alphacalutron enrichment. By the summer of 1945, the Gaseous Diffusion process began to beeffective enough to gradually replace the alpha separations, resulting in the closure of thealpha stage separation in September 1945. Thermal diffusion, like alpha separations, wasalso discontinued. The Beta stage of the Electromagnetic Plant was operated as a toppingoperation for the Gaseous Diffusion Plant through the end of 1946. In December of 1946all enrichment was moved to the Gaseous jn P1ant and all the calutron operationswere closed with the exception of one track of 36 beta calutrons and the two experimentalcalutrons (XAX and XBX in Building 9731). (Compere, 1991)Uranium recovery from CalutronsEnriched uranium salvage and recycle chemistry was essentially a small batch operation,for reasons of criticality. Operations were divided into several phases, which includedcalutron dismantling and washing, calutron component salvage, housekeeping salvage,uranium purification, chlorination, and hexafluoride conversion.In alpha recycle, peroxide precipitation, followed by filtration, was the major method ofpurification In the calutron process for uranium enrichment, at best only 20% of thecharge material reached the receiver; the rest of the ionized uranium halide vapor had to V-31

be recovered from wherever it settled and condensed in whatever chemical form iteventually took.The calutron liner ("L" unit), ion source ("M" unit), and receiver ("E" unit) contained avariety of uranium compounds, including tetrachloride, oxychloride, carbides and oxides,as well as the metal. These materials were in the forms of loose powder, hard surfacedeposits, and deposits in relatively inaccessible areas, such as filament holders andporous graphite surfaces. Operations to recover uranium from the liner included vacuumcleaning and concentrated nitric acid leaching along with physical methods (brushing,grinding, scraping, etc.) and high velocity high volume spray washing. The nitratesolutions generated from these collection operations together with salvage andreclamation from laundry, plant cleanup operations, and floor drains, were a significanturanium stream. Compere, et al note that "Laundry pre-washing was an importanturanium salvage operation". (Compere, 1991)Uranium Concentration and PurificationA variety of processes were used to purify and concentrate the material recovered fromthe calutron process so that it could be oxidized, chlorinated, and returned to thecalutrons. Almost all operations were batch or semi-batch due to concerns overcriticality. This did, however, allow continuous modification of the chemical purificationmethods. Generally the methods were as follows: evaporation, extraction preparation,solvent extraction (solvents included ether and dibutoxy-diethylene glycol — 'carbitol'),peroxide precipitation, calcinations, reduction to the U+4 valence state using alcoholvapor, and chlorination with carbon tetrachloride. At the end of the chlorination stage thecarbon tetrachioride was turned off and nitrogen was passed through the reaction vesselto purge the phosgene. The workforce and primary chemical exposures for variousprocesses are identified within the table below. (Compere, 1991) V-32

Lithium Separation OperationsThe separation of lithium isotopes on an industrial scale is based on the fact that, undercertain conditions, the Li-6 isotope will dissolve more readily in mercury than will the Li-7 isotope Lithium dissolved in mercury solvent is referred to as the lithium amalgamand will remain in a stable state in contact with an aqueous solution only if an electriccurrent is applied to the mixture If this current is removed, the amalgam will decomposeand the lithium will react with the water.If lithium amalgam is allowed to flow in contact with a fluid containing another lithiumcompound, the Li-6 atoms will migrate to the amalgam and the Li-7 atoms to the lithiumcompound in the fluid. This is "two phase, countercurrent, liquid-liquid exchange". Themost productive compound and fluid used in this isotope separation process is lithiumhydroxide dissolved in water.In the lithium separation plant, the cascade section provided for countercurrent flow andintimate contact between the aqueous lithium hydroxide and lithium amalgam. Twodistinct types of cascade systems were used at the Y-12 plant, the Elex process and theColex process. The Elex process was the first lithium separation process used on aproduction scale (Building 9204-4 — Beta4). This was followed by the Colex processwhich was conducted in 9201-4 (Alpha-4) and 9201-5 (Alpha-5). The production periodtook place between August 1953 and May 1963.The Alpha 5 Colex process incorporated vertical columns, replacing the horizontal traysof the Elex system. The Li-6 isotope migrated in the direction of the amalgam flow, andthe Li-7 isotope migrated with the aqueous flow. The Alpha-4 Colex plant was broughton-line in June 1955, soon after the Alpha-S Colex plant.Some work was done by the ORNL in 195 1-1952 on an organic solvent (DPA) to takethe place of water. This was known as the organic exchange (OREX) process. This wasnot pursued past the pilot phase. The Orex pilot plant, Building 9733-1 was located at Y-12 but operated by ORNL during 1951 and 1952. Building 9202 was also used as a pilotplant for the Orex process in 1953 — 1954.(Reference: Mercury at Y-12: A study ofMercury use at the Y-12 Plant, Accountability, and Impacts on Y-12 Workers and theEnvironment —1950to 1983, The 1983 Mercury Task Force, August, 18, 1983, Y/EX-24.)Subsequent to separation the lithium was taken through several fabrication steps toproduce the desired product.Primary buildings for lithium separation included: Beta-4 (Elex process, 1955-1956),Alpha-S (Colex, 1955-1959), Alpha-4 (Colex, 1955-1962), 9733-1 (Orex, 1951-1952),9733-2 (Elex, 1950-195 1), 9202 (Orex Pilot Plant, 1953-1954), Alpha-2 (Elex and ColexPilot plants, 195 1-1955) Two other important support buildings were 9720-26 (MercuryWharehouse) and 8 1-10 (Roasting Furnace — forrecovery of mercury).

Beryllium OperationsBeryllium machining took place in several buildings over time at the Y-12 facility. Twoof the primary buildings that included a great deal of beryllium machining were Alpha-Sand building 9766. Other buildings which have been identified as either being berylliumcontrolled areas or areas with beryllium storage or contamination include: Alpha-i,Alpha-3, 9202, 9733-2, 9215 Third Mill, Beta-4, 9995, and 9998. (DOE, 1973)According to a 1952 trade journal, 'the material ordinarily processed was hot-pressedQMV beryllium. Castings were received rough machined with excess stock on planesurfaces. Operations included surfacing, grooving, deep-hole drilling, facing, andboring.' (Case, 1955)The 1952 trade journal also indicated that the IH monitoring included 'twelve permanentair samplers were installed, one in the locker room, seven in the machining area, one inthe room housing the work-pieces, one in the tool-grinding area, and two in the filterhouse on the influent and effluent sides of the finishing filter.' (Case, 1955) An annualHP program report (Patterson, 1957) also outlines the air sampling and wipe samplingperformed on a routine basis in Building 9766.6.2 9201-1 Alpha 1Building DescriptionThe primary processes conducted in the Alpha 1 Building included Track 1 and 2, Alpha-1 Calutron operations. Calutron operations are detailed in the above section.

Enriched uranium from retired weapons was recovered, usually remelted inan induction furnace, made into a casted part and sent to machining Sometimes,however, the material was cast into long semi-cylindrical or cylindrical shapes and sent toa rolling/pressing mill and then on to a machining shop to be turned and cut to the desireddesign specifications.The 920 1-5 Machine Shop among other materials machined DU, EU, and Beryllium.This building also had a plating shop. The machine shop had four bays (A-D) andparticipants estimated that there were more than 100 machining toolsAccording to Risk mapping participants, 9201-SN had an incinerator in which much ofthe cyanide waste from plating operations was burned.Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported included: Beryllium, Thorium, Mercury, Lithium, EU, EMF,cyanide, copper, nickel, cadmium, chrome, NaK, alcohol, mineral oil, heat, uranium,plutonium, freon, perchioroethylene, TCE, noise, lead, Nitric Acid, Sulfuric Acid, AquaRegia, and asbestos.Participants mentioned that machinists were required to eat at their machines through the1980s. They also mentioned that it was very common to have 'chip' fires frommachining uranium and they would just put the fire out (some mentioned usingperchloroethylene to extinguish the fire) and continue to work. The A-wing wasmentioned as the worst area because the low ceilings would not allow for as effectiveventilation.Participants also mentioned that several people in the plating shop had "cyanidepoisoning" and that operators would often have their "eyes swell shut" from workingover the plating tanks.6.7 9202 Chemical Building or Development LabBuilding DescriptionThe starting material for the uranium enrichment process was natural uranium in the formof U03.

Sometimes,however, the material was cast into long semi-cylindrical or cylindrical shapes and sent toa rolling/pressing mill and then on to a machining shop to be turned and cut to the desireddesign specifications.Enriched Uranium recovery, purification and recycle operations were performedprimarily in buildings 9206 and 9212. These operations consisted of the following: 1)burning combustibles, 2) dissolving and leaching solids, and 3) purifying the uraniumbearing solutions by chemical extraction. Generally, purified uranyl nitrate hexahydrate(UNH) solutions were produced from these operations and then denitrated to uraniumtrioxide (U03), which was then reduced to uranium dioxide (U02). The U02 was thenconverted to uranium tetrafluoride (UF4) by reaction with gaseous anhydrous hydrogenfluoride. The UF4 was then reduced under high temperatures to yield uranium metal,which was cast into the desired form.Recycled highly enriched uranium (contaminated with fission products and transuranics)was received from Savannah River, INEEL ICPP and Hanford and processed in buildings9212 and 9206. Receipt of this material occurred as early as 1953.

Receipt of this material occurred as early as 1953. (ref: Y-12 MassBalance Report)In 1958 an accidental nuclear fission excursion occurred in Building 9212 due to a 93%enriched uranium solution being pumped into a nuclear "un-safe" container. (ChemRisk,196) This incident resulted in a spike in the external radiation data for that year dueprimarily to exposures of approximately 300 rad to 5 individuals and less than 100 rad to3 individuals. (Dixon, 1959, McLendon, 1959, Hurst, 1959, Andrews, 1959)Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported included: Uranium, U-238, EU, HEU, UF4, Externalradiation, internal radiation, perchloroethylene, graphite, cadmium, tungsten, magnesium,alcohol, trimsol, noise, fuming nitric acid, sodium hydroxide, lithium, neutron exposures,freon and DAG.6.18 9215 HEU Metal Forming and Machine ShopsBuilding DescriptionThis facility housed enriched uranium processing and weapons parts fabrication(including beryllium, lithium, and thorium parts).The enriched uranium operations included: 1) reduction of UF6 to UF4, 2) reduction ofUF4 to metal, 3) casting or forging, 4) rolling and forming in mill operations, 5)machining of metals, 6) wet chemistry purification, recycle, and salvage, and 7) UF4extraction.

however, the material was cast into long semi-cylindrical or cylindrical shapes and sent toa rolling/pressing mill and then on to a machining shop to be turned and cut to the desireddesign specifications.Building 9215 had the following primary operational areas: M-Wing, 0-Wing, P-Wing,M-Wing Blister Area, H2 Machine Shop (Building 9998 — connectedwith 9215),Metallurgical Lab, and the Third Mill.The 0-Wing included Salt Baths, Oil Baths and Lead Baths that were used to heat upuranium materials so that they could be rolled. The Salt Baths contained PotassiumCarbonate, Lithium, and Sodium Hydroxide and were operated at high temperatures. TheOil Baths used DAG, Perchloroethylene, and Freon as lubricants and the process wasused for hydroforming. The Lead Baths (80% Lead and 20% Bismuth) were used forslow heat-treating ("aging"). The material came to the 0-Wing out of the casting furnace(9212 E Wing Furnace) and at the 0-Wing that would form into a billet (using the baths)and roll into a plate. Risk Mapping participants identified the 0-Wing as the most highlycontaminated are within 9215.Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported included: Uranium (enriched and depleted), uranium alloys,black oxide (U308), plutonium, perchloroethylene, ethylene glycol, beryllium, TCE,Lead, asbestos, heat, noise, PCBs, lithium, DAG, freon, acetone, alcohol, dykam, carbontetrachloride, lead, aluminum, fiberglass, and noise.Risk Mapping participants mentioned that there were a lot of skin rash problems in M-Wing and 0-Wing and that prior to 1990 there was "no industrial hygiene or healthphysics". They also mentioned that uranium "chip" fires were very common and that youwould just "hold your breath and put them out".6.19 9401-2 Plating ShopBuilding DescriptionThis building was reportedly a plate shop that was formerly the steam plant.

After thedecision was made to abandon use of most of the early calutron tracks in 1945, theremaining staff turned their focus on using a pilot facility with both alpha and betacalutrons for stable isotope separation and enrichment research. By 1950, 173 isotopes of43 elements had been collected. Each year the range and purity of isotopes separated wasincreased as chemical techniques and equipment improved. (Compere, 1991)Stable isotope runs were primarily on the XAX and the XBX calutrons. Other unitswhich were used included TR-1 thru TR-6 and SG-1 thru SG-4 which we believe werethe beta calutrons in building 9204-3.This building also was used for the Orex pilot process development (9733-1 in 195 1-1952) and the Elex process (9733-2 in 1950-1951).Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported included: External radiation, internal radiation, mercury,uranium, lithium, and various stable isotopes.6.22 9996 ManufacturingBuilding DescriptionThis building had crucible machining operations which by the mid 60s were moved to theAlpha-i facility.

It included the H-2 Machine Shop, theH-i Foundry and Maintenance shops. The building provided maintenance and machiningsupport for building 9212. The H-2 Machine shop and M-Wing Shop were renovated in1988. The facility also did carbon foam and epoxy production operations.Primary ExposuresPrimary exposures reported included: Black Oxide (UO2), DU, Stainless steel, andUranium with metal alloys, beryllium, and epoxy.7.0 DISCUSSION OF PRIMARY EXPOSURES7.1 RadiationMonitoring Policies at the FacilitiesHistorically, the main purpose of the radiation monitoring programs has been to assurethat each worker's exposure to radiation was kept below the current annual prescribedoccupational exposure limit. Because of this aim, data collection in the early years wasvery limited for workers who were considered to have low potential for exposure. Also,at the time of this report, limited information is available concerning the rationale used todecide which workers to monitor, implementation of these decisions, and the methodsused for assessing reliability, variability, and lower limits of detection. At each facilitythe radiation safety personnel were responsible for the monitoring program, making theprograms essentially independent of each other.Because internal monitoring programs were begun in 1951 by ORNL and in 1950 by Y-12 the definition of "not monitored" varies by plant and by year. By the early 1950s aworker who was not monitored for internal exposure was judged to have low potential forexposure. Because of policies in effect, external monitoring data are available for mostworkers from Y-12 only since 1961. ORNL began monitoring for external radiation in1943. (Watkins, 1993)External Radiation ExposureBefore November 1951 only those workers entering areas of potential external radiationexposure were monitored for external dose. In 1947 all workers entering a radiation areamore than three times a week were assigned permanent film badges, but by 1949 V-45

--- Page 70 ---
permanent film badges were issued to all workers entering these restricted areas at leastonce a week In November of 1951 all workers entering the main X-10 areawererequired to have a film badge, and by September of 1953 the film badge and securitybadge needed for entry were combined into one (Watkins, 1993). Risk mappingparticipants reported that they would often do work using a self reading dosimeter (SRD)and would not wear their film badge They mentioned that the SRD readings wererecorded in HP logs but they were not sure if this information was included in theirpersonal dose record. (Risk Mapping Interviews, 2003)According to site records X-10 used only daily SRDs from 1943 until about 1945, in1945 they began to use weekly film badges until the late SOs when they changed toquarterly film badges and in about 1975 they began to use either quarterly or annualTLDs. At the Y-12 facility they also started with SRDs and in about 1950 they began touse weekly film badges, in about 1959-1960 they used monthly film badges and after1960 until about 1980 they used quarterly film badges. After 1980 they used eitherquarterly or annual TLDs. From 1961-1974 badges for low potential exposure work werenot always read, rather a sample of the badges issued would be read to verify that theareas were being properly defined. For early film badges the minimum detectable dosewas approximately 25 mrem. The sensitivity of film badges in later years was improvedover that of earlier years. (Watkins, 1993)After extensive error checking procedures, annual external doses were calculated bysumming all credible gamma and neutron film badge readings taken during the year.Because of the variability in dosimeter types, reading frequencies, and monitoringpolicies over time and facilities, annual doses obtained from the simple summing ofreadings during the year may not be comparable at all times, and a recorded dose may notalways accurately represent the true amount of a worker's radiation exposure. A summaryof the recorded annual doses by year and by department is included in Appendix F. Thisappendix contains a compilation of dose data from three sources: H&S reports, CEDRCER data files, and CEDR Mortality study data files. The mortality study data filesincluded some extrapolation of doses for times when data was missing and therefore theresults are different than the other data sets. A summary of the external dose data (annualdoses greater than 500 mrem) versus department is included in Appendix B. Internal Radiation Exposure Film badges measure external exposure over a given period of time; monitoring forinternal exposure is performed at specific points in time; therefore, the results areestimates of the body or organ burden at the time of measurement. The primary methodsof internal monitoring used were urinalysis and in vivo gamma spectrometry, but fecalanalysis was also performed in some instances. The dosimetry associated with analysis ofurine for radioisotopes of concern depends on relating the amount of an isotope in areference volume of urine to the amount contained in the body or in specific organs. Therelationship between these two amounts is affected by many variables, such as the V-46

--- Page 71 ---
radioisotope, time since exposure, the chemical and physical form of the isotope, andbiological variation among individuals.In general, workers were monitored only if they worked in locations or administrativegroups that were judged by supervisors or radiation safety organizations to have internalexposure potential. Periodically, after about 1950 individuals from the unmonitoredworkers were randomly selected and monitored by ORNL to confirm that unmonitoredworkers were indeed unexposed to internal radiation. The policy at Y-12 was to increasemonitonng frequency as internal exposure potential increased (Watkins, 1993, Patterson,1957, West, 1977)Workers at TEC had a high potential for internal contamination because of the processperformed at the facility. However, personal monitoring data were not available becauseno bioassay or whole body counting programs were established when it was in operation.Review of External and Internal Data from Databases and HP ReportsThere is an increasing trend in external doses at ORNL until the late 1950s and a steadydecrease afterwards, while at Y-12 there is greater variability in the total recorded annualexternal dose. The Y-12 peak in 1958 is due to a criticality accident involving eightworkers and does not represent a general increase in external dose. (Appendix F)The percentage of individuals monitored for external exposures at X-10 remained atabout 85-90% from 1950-1985 while the percentage at Y-12 was at about 20% until 1960when it was raised to 85-90% Generally the percentage of workers monitored forinternal exposures was between 20- 40% each year with the highest percentages for bothplants occurring around 1963-1965.A summary of the annual radiation dose ranges for the X-10 site is included in AppendixF. It is interesting to note that in 1960 there is a sharp drop off in the number ofindividuals with annual doses in excess of 2 rem and also a sharp increase in the numberof individuals being monitored.A 1958 HP report indicated that of the 10 highest cumulative dose due to penetratingradiation 9 individuals were from the Radioisotope Production Division The cumulativedoses were received over 7 — 15years and ranged from 42.5 — 64.8rem. (Hart, 1958)HP risk mapping participants thought that the worst areas for internal exposures wouldhave been Buildings 3038, 3517 and 3019.Recorded external doses at Y-12 were generally lower than doses at X-10. The onlysignificant internal monitoring was uranium urinalysis and in-vivo testing (uranium-235and thorium). Over the years it was assumed that monitoring for uranium would besatisfactory as a surrogate measure of other contaminants in the uranium (i.e.,transuranics (such as neptunium and plutonium) or fission products in recycled fuel).Data was unavailable to determine whether there were processes or areas where these V-47

--- Page 72 ---
transuranics may have concentrated and therefore been a greater potential hazard.Additionally, a recent report discussing the current Y-12 Internal dose program(Eckerman, 1999) stated that "following the recent restart of operations at the Y-12 Plant,the Radiological Control Organization (RCO) observed that the enriched uraniumexposures appeared to involve insoluble rather than soluble uranium that presumablycharacterized most earlier Y-12 operations." Based on this finding the bioassay programwas modified, particularly specifying the need for routine fecal sampling. This raisesquestions with regard to potential missed doses.7.2 BerylliumData from the Y-12 Beryllium Worker Enhanced Medical Surveillance Program, fundedby DOE, indicated that the buildings associated with CBD cases or sensitized workersincluded: Alpha-5, 9202, Butler Building, Beta-4, Beta-2, 9212, 9766, 9995 and 9998.(Bingham, 1997)Additionally, a 1973 Y-12 document (DOE, 1973) identified Alpha-5, Alpha-3, 9202,and 9995 as "Beryllium Control Areas". Additionally, H&S summary reports from 1953-1960 indicate that Beryllium air sampling was frequently conducted in Building 9766 andto a less extent in Building 9212 (Appendix D).A broad based approach to defining the group potentially exposed to beryllium isrecommended since published data (Newman 1989, Kreiss 1996) demonstrate that whilethere are job related and exposure related elevated risks for chronic beryllium disease(CBD), individuals with low-level exposure can be affected For this reason a two-tieredapproach is recommended based on exposure groupings.7.3 MercuryThe mercury concentration in the workplace air was monitored frequently at the Y-12facility (In 1956, over 200,000 air readings were taken — seeAppendix D). In the 1955cascade start-up, many readings of mercury concentrations in the workplace air werehigher than the 0.1 mg/m"3 then recommended (current recommendation is 0.05mg/mt3). A urinalysis program started in 1953 was expanded to provide a check on theworker mercury exposures. During 1955 and into 1956 approximately 200 — 300workershad readings that exceeded the 0.3 mg/liter of urine recommended limit. When aworkers' urinary mercury remained elevated for several specimens the workers were re-assigned. Approximately 70 workers were involved in temporary re-assignments of thisnature. In addition to the air sampling and urine program, there was a special medicalsurveillance program involving clinical examinations of mercury workers beingperformed every six months, Persons with a history of albumin uria, kidney problems, orhypertension were screened out and not allowed to work with mercury. (Mercury TaskForce, 1983(a), 1983(b))During the latter part of the Colex start-up during 1955, AEC and Y-12 managementundertook a crash program to bring the workplace mercury vapor levels down toacceptable levels. Air sampling results seem to suggest that airborne concentrations were V-48

--- Page 73 ---
reduced after 1955 as is indicated by the drop in the percentage of air samples in excessof the 0.1 mglm"3limit(see Appendix D).A Y-12 1977 report, Mercury Inventory at Y-12 Plant, 1950 through 1977, indicated that2.4 million pounds of mercury has been 'lost' or 'unaccounted for'. (Mercury TaskForce, 1983(a), 1983(b))A Emory University study conducted in 199x as a follow-up to University of Michiganstudy of the mercury workers at Y-12 showed that 'neurological effects of relativelyheavy exposure were still detectable more than 30 years after cessation of that exposure'.The study concluded that the exposure measure with the strongest association with theoutcome was cumulative exposure (cases were selected by cumulative exposure of >=2000ugHg/liter-quareter or a one time urine value of greater than 600 ugHg/liter). Thedepartment numbers identified as "High Exposure Potential" in the NIOSH reportincluded: 2025, 2026, 2681, 2682, 2683, 2685, and 2690. (Emory University)Priority buildings (buildings where frequent sampling for mercury was conducted and/ora high percentage of samples were identified in excess of the site MPC levels), based oncompany lB records (Appendix D), include: Beta-4, Alpha-2, 9202, Alpha-5 and Alpha-4. According to a 1957 Health Physics Program Report (Y-1186) (Patterson, 1957) "aroutine mercury vapor sampling program is maintained in buildings 9201-2, 9201-4,9201-5, 81-10, and 9204-2; buildings in which a potentially serious mercury vaporproblem may exist". During 1955 through 1956 the percent of mercury urine sampleswhich exceeded the MPC (0 3mg/m"3) rangedfrom 10% to 30% A further breakdownof this data indicates that Machinists were exposed to the highest levels while chemicaloperators were lower and electrician still lower than that. TheMachinists reportedconcentrations ranged from 0.5 to0.3 mgHg/liter, the chemical operators ranged from0.46 to 0.3, and fially the reported concentrations related to Electricians exposures rangedfrom 0.12 to 0.2 ugHg/liter. (Mercury Task Force, 1983(a), 1983(b)At X-10, Building 4501 housed the Orex pilot project and during risk mapping sessionswas reported to have had a lot of mercury. Other uses of mercury at the X-10 site appearto be on a smaller scale (instruments, labs, etc.). It should however, be pointed out thatmany X-10 workersbegan working at the Y-12 site (as X-10 employees) after thecalutron operations were shut down.7.4 CausticsNitric acid and Hydrofluoric acid were used extensively in isotope separation andpurification operations. Specifically buildings 3019, 9212, 9215, 3505, Alpha-5, 9203,9206, 9929, and 9401-2 were involved in uranium or other isotope recovery, processing,separation or purification. Steps within these processes involved many caustic materialsincluding two of the primary acids used, Hydrofluoric acid and Nitric acid (in some casesfuming nitric acid). V-49

H&S summary reports indicate that air sampling for lithium was conducted at the Y-12site Risk mapping participants mentioned that lithium at the site caused strong lungimtation and sometimes frequent sneezing Also, frequently had skin burns fromworking with this material.Additionally, Tetramethyl ammonium borohydrate (TMAB) was present at the Y-12 siteand is, according to toxicology references (Holland) a strong irritant and is considered tohave similar toxic properties as other boron compounds.7.5SolventsChlorinated solvents were used extensively at both the Y-12 and X-1O facilities over thehistory of the sites. Generally the use of carbon tetrachloride was only prevalent duringthe early years of operation. TCE and perchloroethylene were used extensivelythroughout the history of the sites. The areas where potential exposures were thegreatest included the pilot separation or processing buildings and the machine shops.Participants in the nsk mapping sessions indicated that the machinists would "use perc toput out chip fires while machining uranium". They indicated they would 'use it foreverything'.In addition to the common chlorinated solvents mentioned above and used for cleaningand degreasing, acetonitrile was used at the Y-12 site.7.6 NoiseNoise exposure was reported as a problem associated with production operations at boththe X-1O and Y-12 sites. The type of operations conducted at the sites over the history(e.g. separations operations, calutrons, lithium separation operations, machining) wouldbe consistent with elevated noise exposures. Risk mapping participants also indicatedthat hearing protection requirements, or the adherence to the requirements, was fairly laxin the early years.7.7AsbestosAs in many of the DOE facilities, asbestos use was prevalent at both X-1O and Y-12.Asbestos was common in all building materials and additionally other uses includingasbestos blankets, asbestos covering on piping, and asbestos gloves were reported;Highest exposures to asbestos would likely have been maintenance workers due to themore intrusive nature of their jobs.

Section VI. Focus Groups(Th

--- Page 84 ---
IntroductionDescription of Focus GroupsIn conducting the Needs Assessment of the X-1O and Y-12 workers at Oak Ridge, it wasnecessary to find out directly from the workers what they would like in an occupational medicalscreening program. While his was partially accomplished through questionnaires, talking toworkers in person in an organized setting was essential to developing the program mostresponsive to their needs. Thus, four focus group sessions with former and current workers wereconducted to gauge their occupational health concerns, how they perceive their occupationalhealth risks, their desire for and expectations of medical surveillance and high risk notification,their current access to health care, and potential issues concerning outreach.Two focus groups were held on July 8, one for X-10 and one for Y-12. On August 5, twoadditional sessions took place with different participants from the two facilities.Because of classification issues, the four sessions were held in a secured room in theSecurity Building at the site and were restricted to those workers with L or Qclearances(for Y-12). Temporary clearances were granted for retired workers. The Focus Group Moderator for allfour sessions was Tom Moser, local coordinator for the WHPP program at K-25, a current workerat K-25 and a long-time health and safety training coordinator for the local. Mr. Moser has a Qclearance.The health and safety representatives for the respective plants assisted him in thesessions: Jeff Hill, David Barncord and Jim Blankenship for X-l0, and Larry Jones, HaroldLawson and Carl Johnson for Y- 12. Carl "Bubba" Scarbrough, ATLC president, worked with thehealth and safety representatives to plan and set up the sessions. He also welcomed each groupand provided a brief overview of how ATLC was able to get the program initiated.The session was taped with a tape recorder supplied by DOE. The tapes and thedemographic data sheets were submitted to the DOE security office for clearance prior to release.Once cleared, a professional transcribed the tapes; this report is based on that transcription andreports from the health and safety representatives and Tom Moser. Due to a technical probleminvolving the tape, some of the comments from the participants were inaudible.The Moderator Guide used for the sessions was modeled on the one originally used at theK-25 focus groups, which was modified by the X-10 and Y-12 health and safety representativesafter group discussions on May 20, 2003 (See Appendix _). Atthat time, Sylvia Kieding gavean instructional presentation on focus groups and made recommendations to Tom Moser on howthe X-10 and Y-12 sessions should be conducted.The presence of knowledgeable and trusted health and safety representatives from X-10and Y-12, as well as the experience of the moderator, Tom Moser, provided an indispensablecontribution to the discussions.Focus Group FormatAll participants were assured that their names would remain confidential and were askedpermission to audiotape the session. As decided previously by the ATLC health and safetyrepresentatives, the agreement had to be unanimous. The participants were asked to fill outdemographic information sheets, which are summarized in the tables preceding each set of focusgroups.The participants consisted of former and current workers, both salaried and hourly. TheATLC health and safety representatives attempted to make the groups representative of the sites,selecting participants on the basis of their experience and job category at the plant.vI-1

Report of X-1O Focus Group Findings, by TpjcThe following is a breakdown of responses to the questions posed by the Moderatorfollowing the Moderator's Guide for the X-10 sessionsthe mornings of July 8 and August 5 Theresults from the two X-l0 focus groups have been condensed into the most salient findings fromboth sessions.Topic I: Health Concerns —Perceptionof Occupational Health Risks Questions:Participants were asked if they think that they or their co-workers are at risk fromoccupationally related health problems and, if so, what they are. Summary of responses:• The primary hazards named by the participants included radiation, mercury, asbestos,beryllium and chemical exposures in general.• The workers said that management told them that radiation didn't bother you. Workerswere sent into radiation areas repeatedly regardless of whether or not they were hot.• Participants said that they would go on a job and not know what they were working withand that their exposures dated back to a time when monitoring was inadequate or non-existent. There was really no program to address the various hazards. • Most of them stated that cancer and lung disease are their major concerns from jobexposures A few mentioned heart disease The cancers of concern were prostrate andleukemia and one area reproduction was cited as an area where "everyone got cancer"• The workers felt that the cancer rate was higher at X- 10 than in the general populationBecause of lack of ventilation, they felt that secretaries could have high or higherexposures than other workers to such substances as mercury. Every day they walked pasta building with a mercury pit without any protection.Sample responses:"In a steam pit below a particular building, there was a mercury pit. They literally shoveled themercury out of the pit."We worked at a time when asbestos was not viewed as a problem you d have to shower in theafternoon to get the asbestos out of your hair.""I was a laborer finally assigned to the burial ground collecting and transporting and disposingof radioactive waste.""in a 1995 regular (every two year) screening, 1 had a PSA reading of 51.85 but was not toldabout it until June of 1999. 1 had prostrate surgery eventually followed up by 35 radiationtreatments. Hand I been told in 1995 that I had the 51.85 reading, in all probability the cancerwould not have spread outside the prostrate VI-3

"I have had vein problems, heart problems and I got lung problems. I was never informed by thecompany but I have had asbestosis.""My mother worked in rep roduction for years and she died with leukemia. Everybody in thereproduction area had some form of cancer."Topic II: Health Care/Delivery Utilization IssuesQuestions:1. Participants were asked about their current medical needs and current medical programs.2. Participants were also asked if they would be interested in and participate in a medical andhealth information program for their occupational health concerns.3. The workers were asked what they would like in an occupational health program andwhere/how they would like the program administered.4. Are there any roadblocks or impediments to participation, and how can they be resolved?Summary of responses:• Participants generally had periodic physicals from their primary care physicians butadmitted that the primary care physician never discussed their work nor was he/shequalified to look at occupational disease.• The workers were unanimously in favor of an occupational medical screening program,under certain conditions. They were emphatic that none of the testing take place atclinics in Oak Ridge because they felt there were no physicians that could be trusted inOak Ridge.•They would like a complete physical with special attention paid to the exposures at thesite. They felt that plant medical records should be incorporated into the testing program.Two of the most important components of the program should be trust and credibility,which should be reflected in the clinics chosen Clinics should be within driving distanceand the program should be continuous as opposed to consisting of a single exam. Itshould also include current workers. They are hoping to get the CT scan unit because oftheir exposures to beryllium, asbestos and possible other lung carcinogens. They feel thatthe CT scan unit can save lives, as it has done at K-25.• The three biggest impediments to a successful program would be lack of trust,inconvenience, and the absence of physicians independent of the DOE. Also cited wasthe difficulty of getting plant medical records for use in the program.Sample responses:"I would like to see a program that would just monitor our health, just a good overall physicallooking for things that might be particular to exposures that we might have had in the workplace,either chemicals, radiation paints, or whatever.""I think the perception is that Oak Ridge physicians may be biased... they're not going to step onanybody's toes."

Topic III: Outreach/Access and Health Education/Information ResourcesQuestions:1. Participants were asked the best ways to notify people of a medical testing program and toinvite them to participate.2. What are their current sources of health information?3. How do participants like to get health information?Summary of responses:• There was general agreement among the workers that direct mailings to their houses arethe best form of notification and invitation. Other methods included the TV news, retireenewsletters, and a notice in the checks paid out to retirees. Participants also cited word-of-mouth.• Current sources of health information include the AARP magazine, a retirement paper,brochures in doctor's offices and the Internet. They like to get health informationthrough direct mailings.Sample responses:"You get a retirement newsletter, they've got addresses."Most everyone watches the news. If you had it on, like channel 10.""We're retirees, benefit plans will have, will know where we're at because they mail our checksout.""I'm involved in the sale of health insurance and life insurance and those kinds of thins and I'mbombarded with all that information. I tend to try to read it as much as I can and I am one that,fIsee a brochure laying around somewhere, I tend to pick it up." Observations, X-10 Focus GroupsThe use of focus groups in this needs assessment has yielded information that will beinvaluable in structuring a medical testing program and providing health hazard education at X-10.The impressions captured here are based on a review of the transcript of the sessions aswell as demographic sheets, both of which were reviewed by DOE for clearance. The focusgroup moderator, Tom Moser, and the X-10 health and safety representatives were, of course,responsible for the quality of the data gathered and for keeping the discussions focused.There was a lack of trust in DOE and local clinics, which they believed were too closelytied to DOE. The lack of past exposure data prompted the recommendation that any medicaltesting program consist of a comprehensive physical supplemented by testing targeted to thespecific exposures at X-10. VI-5

--- Page 89 ---
There was repeated insistence that medical data from the plant medical clinics beincluded and reviewed as part of the medical testing program.All of the participants felt that the program should be ongoing rather than consist of aone-time exam. They felt that the latency period for many diseases demanded periodicmonitoring.Recommendations, X-1O•The need exists for an occupational medical surveillance program.Focus group participants felt that an occupational medical program wasnecessary because of the lack of knowledge of their primary care physicians ofthe impact of occupational exposures.• Independent physicians without any ties should administer the medical testingprogram to DOE or the contractors and in cooperation with ATLC.Participants cited trust and credibility as the most important components of anymedical testing program or there would be lack of interest and participation.They ruled out Oak Ridge as a testing site because of its close ties with DOE andthe contractors, for instance. Local clinics should be used but they should bewithin driving distance.• The testing program should incorporate plant medical records.Participants stressed their desire to include plant medical records if this wereat all feasible.• Participants favored direct mailings to inform workers of the program andinvite them to participate.The workers felt that the best way to reach X- 10 workers is through direct mail,perhaps through a notice included in pension and pay checks.• The testing program should be on going rather than a one-time occurrence.Participants repeatedly stressed the need for periodic testing because of the longlatency periods common to many of the diseases of concern.• Current as well as former workers should participate in the testing program.The focus group members felt that the program should begin with the retirees butshould go on to include current workers because of the mistrust of the site clinic.

Report of Y-12 Focus Group Findings, By TopicThe following is a breakdown of responses posed by the Moderator using theModerator's Guide for the Y-12 sessions that took place on July 8 and August 5. Questions 3-5of Topic I are included in Topic II for continuity. The findings from the two groups arecombined here to give an overall picture.Topic I: Health Concerns —Perceptionof Occupational Health RisksQuestions:Participants were asked if they think that they or their co-workers are at risk fromoccupationally related health problems and, if so, what they are.Summary of responses:• Workers cited concerns about exposures to uranium smoke (from uranium fires),asbestos, mercury, solvents, acids, and beryllium, as well as heavy metals.• Health concerns included mesothelioma and cancers of the lung, prostrate, stomach, andbrain as well as hearing loss, chronic beryllium disease, heart problems and neurologicalproblems from mercury exposure.• The participants attributed many of the health problems today to unsafe work practices inthe past as well as threats of job loss if workers complained about working conditions.For instance, in the past, workers would eat, drink and smoke around the equipment;painters would work in an area with no ventilation; and personal protective equipmentsuch as respirators were not available The contractor failed to warn workers of the jobhazards, telling them that "they could eat all of it [they] want, not worry about it."Sample responses:"I had a brother-in-law work out there and he had cancer of the brain and passed away and itwas related back to the plant.""I left Y- 12 when I was 59, 1 had heart problems, I had hearing problems, where we went throughso many noisy compressors, areas that we had to go in.""Some of my fellow workers got berylliosis. We lost one last year, he had lung cancer and we'velost a lot of our group, the painters.""Well, I've got one out there (machinist) that's got cancer of the bladder. I know another onewho's got cancer of the bladder."Topic II: Health Care/Delivery Utilization IssuesQuestions:1. Participants were asked about their current medical needs and current medical programs. VI-8

--- Page 92 ---
Are the workers interested in a program for their occupational health concerns? How would itbe structured? Would you and your fellow workers participate and do you receive yearly (orperiodic) physicals?3. Where do the workers go for current medical services? Are there specific clinics or hospitalsthat people feel most comfortable with?4. Are there any impediments to participation in an occupational medical program and how canthese be resolved?Summary of responses:• The current workers now get a physical from the site clinic every five years instead ofevery two years, as in the past.• The retired workers generally get physicals every year from their primary care physician.One current worker expressed a concern about taking the BeLPT because if sensitivity isconfirmed, it could have job repercussions.• Workers are skeptical of local primary care physicians' ability to be attentive to theirneeds.• Those with health problems not only have a primary care physician but a specialist aswell.• In general, the workers want a well-structured physical examination by physiciansindependent of the DOE and its contractors. They want to be screened for hearing loss,cancers and stomach problems.• They want the CT scan like the one the K-25 screening program has. They also want toinclude neurological testing for mercury.• They would like for plant medical records to be included in the program and expressedconcern about the difficulty of getting and using those records.• They want physicians and a program outside of the Oak Ridge area because of its tieswith DOE and its contractors.• They are concerned with cost and credibility because of their past experience with anyprogram funded by DOE. They cited transportation as another impediment toparticipation.Sample responses:"A big problem right now is... some doctor's offices just herd you in and herd you out. They workfor these big outfits and they just have to see so many patients in a day. It makes you feel like youain't getting taken care"This is a company town where (sic) they won't admit it or not. When it comes to push andshove, I'd rather have an independent somebody that's not tied to this area. VI-9

--- Page 93 ---
"A lot of people who are weekly and monthly who did not take the BeLPT are afraid f theygetconfirmed that they're sensitive to it, it could affect their job."I think one of the roadblocks if they do this is getting this screening out to the entire workers, Ithink it's hard to find them. That would be a real roadblock."Topic III: Outreach/Access and Health Education/Information Resources Questions:1.Participants were asked the best way to notify people of an occupational medical testingprogram and to invite them to participate.2. What are their current sources of health information?3. How do participants like to get health information?Summary of responses:• Some of the suggestions for contacting people for participation included gettingaddresses and telephone numbers from the union, word-of-mouth, brochures mailed totheir house advertising a "Y-12 health screening or ATLC health screening," theretirement newsletter, posters at local retail stores like Wal-Mart, telephone and rallies forsick workers.• Their principal (and preferred) sources of medical information are television, the doctors'office, or publications —suchas the AARP's —sentto their homes. Sample responses:"Workers, if they make a list of people they work with .. . especiallyfyouknow them or knowtheir address, phone number, just write it down and when this comes about, we'll be callingthem.""What you were talking about like telling a buddy when we start it, ask about other people. Doyou know anybody else that would be interested""Anything that's got Y-12, even the paper, I check it." Observations, Y-12 Focus GroupsThe two focus group sessions withcurrent and former Y-12 workers on July 8 and August5, 2003, were yielded valuable information that will assist in structuring the medical testingprogram. Of particular value was the information gathered regarding the workers' healthconcerns and current medical care, types of tests desired, the preferred clinics for testing, andsuggestions for outreach.Participants in the two sessions included both current and former Y-12 workers (bothhourly and salaried), all of whom were male, with an average age of 63.5 and an average of 31.2years working the plant. VT-lU

--- Page 94 ---
Because of the classified nature of much of the work at Y-12, the focus group was held in asecure room in the security building at the site. Because the author of this report had noclearance, the final report is based on the reports of the moderator and health and safetyrepresentatives, and the transcripts created from the tape recordings of the two sessions.The participants expressed a distrust of both DOE and the contractors, emphasizing thatthey did not want to use clinics in Oak Ridge because of its "company town" nature.They stated a desire for an independent occupational medical testing program that wouldnot only provide a thorough physical examination, but one tailored to the various exposuresincurred at the facility (i.e., radiation, asbestos, beryllium, mercury, solvents, acids and noise).Both groups of participants wanted plant medical records to be incorporated into theprogram if at all possible. They also felt strongly that, because of their exposures, they wouldbenefit from having the CT scan unit that the K-25 screening program has.Recommendations, Y-12•There is a need for an occupational medical testing programParticipants clearly felt that their personal physicians did not address theiroccupational health concerns, nor were they qualified to do so.•The participants prefer local clinics in a convenient, easily accessible locationwith oversight from occupational medical physician. They do not want theclinics in Oak Ridge.Access, cost, and transportation are some of the concerns expressed by theparticipants. They did not want to use Oak Ridge clinics because of theirproximity to and influence by DOE and the contractors.•Participants want to include current as well as former workers.While they feel the first priority should be the former workers, they also want toinclude the current workers in the program.• Word of mouth and direct mailings are the preferred methods forcommunication.Participants recommended, as a means of outreach, that workers write down thenames and addresses of other potential participants. They suggested that mailingsmarked "Y-12" would attract the attention of recipients.•All of the participants expressed a desire that the CT scan unit used at K-25 bepart of their program. VT-il

Section VII. Epidemiologic and Health Studies Review

--- Page 96 ---
Epidemiologic Studies of Y-12 and ORNL WorkersWorkers at Y-12 and ORNL have been the subject of numerous epidemiologic studies.With a few exceptions, these studies have examined the mortality experience of theseworkers. While they suffer some important limitations, these studies provide data usefulin understanding the effects of exposure to radiation and a small number of chemicalhazards at these facilities.As a rule, however, mortality studies done on DOE cohorts have certain importantlimitations:• Most mortality studies involve comparing the mortality experience of employedworkers (in this case employed at Y- 12 and ORNL) with that of the generalpopulation. This comparison population includes many individuals to sick ordisabled to work, individuals also more likely to die prematurely than people inthe workforce. This bias, known as the "healthy worker effect," results in theunderestimation of the effects of toxic exposure in the population under study. Astrong "healthy worker effect exists in studies of Oak Ridge workers.• Most studies at Oak Ridge were undertaken long after the exposures of interestoccurred. While there are limited exposure data available (either through actualrecords or retrospective dose reconstruction) for radiation exposure, there are fewrecords available to quantify exposure to any of the toxic chemicals to which Y-12 and ORNL workers were exposed.• The potential for confounding and selection bias is significant in these studies.The oldest facilities began employing workers in the early 1940s; these workershave been followed the longest and constitute a sizable proportion of all workersstudied. The exposures that occurred during World War II were likely somewhatdifferent than subsequent exposures, since production processes changedsignificantly after the war in many facilities. At the same time, employmentselection factors are likely to be of some importance. Workers who were firstemployed during World War II (and who were not in the armed services duringthe war) are likely to be different than those who came to work in later years inmany respects, beyond the obvious difference in birth cohort, exposure historyand years of follow-up. As a result, for example, examination of the effect ofradiation exposure on the mortality experience of workers first employed after age45mayactually be detecting a birth cohort effect, or the effect of some type ofselection bias in employment, rather or in addition to a radiation effect.These limitations must be considered in reviewing the findings discussed in this needsassessment.In the section below, we attempt to review what can be learned from the epidemiologicstudies on Oak Ridge workers. Since different versions of most of these studies havebeen published several times, we attempt to cite the most recent report, except in those Vll-1

--- Page 97 ---
cases where earlier versions provide additional useful data. Negative results are notsummarized, except where they are necessary to explain a choice made in the design ofthe screening program.1. Overall and Radiation-Related MortalityThe largest study of the mortality experience of Oak Ridge workers involved 28,00deaths among 106,000 persons employed at one Y-12, ORNL or K-25 between 1943 and1985 (Frome et a! 1997), expanding upon an earlier study that included only white maleswho worked before 1947 (Frome, Cragle, McLain 1990). The objective of the study wasto examine the effects of radiation exposure on mortality, since the type of radiationexposure was different at each facility, the facility was the primary surrogate measureemployed for radiation exposure. However, many of these workers worked at more thanone of the Oak Ridge facilities, posing a methodologic challenge to the authors. Ratherthan exclude workers who had worked at more than one facility, as had been done insome previous studies, the investigators employed a Poisson regression analysis tocontrol facility as well as for age, birth cohort, length of employment, socio-economicstatus and a rough surrogate for internal radiation exposure.Overall, the all cause (SMR=l.00, based on 27,982 deaths) and all cancer (SM.R=0.98,6,114 deaths) mortality of the cohort were not different than those expected based onnational comparison rates. There were substantial differences in the mortality patternsassociated with each facility. Workers at K-25 had higher risk of mortality from non-malignant causes than workers at Y-12 or ORNL Lung cancer was the only specificcancer associated with external radiation (SMR=1.18, based on 1,849 lung cancer deaths,no 95% CI provided; among white males employed at Y-12 or ORNL, there was a doseeffect relationship between external radiation exposure and risk of death for all causesand for cancer. External radiation dose with a ten-year lag was found to increase overallrisk of death by 0.31 per Sv (95% CI = 0.16,1.01) and cancer mortality by 1.45 per Sv(95% CI =015, 3 48) Interestingly, no relationship between external radiation exposureand leukemia was seen, perhaps suggesting that some or all of the radiation effect seenfor lung cancer may the result of an unidentified bias or the incomplete control ofconfounders.Wilkinson (2000) conducted a mortality study among female workers throughout theDOE complex; reported that the relative risk for all cause mortality was increased amongwomen not monitored for radiation, in comparison to those who were monitored, at bothY-12 (RR =1.20,95% CI=1.03, 1,39) and ORNL (RR = 1.30,95% CI =1.07,1.57). Thiswas also true for cancer mortality at ORNL (RR = 1.4,95% CI=1.O, 2.0). This is likelyan artifact of the health worker effect, with women in more stable, higher paying jobsmore likely to be monitored. For all DOE sites combined, Wilkinson reported thatleukemia risk increased with cumulative exposure (RRIrem = 1.13,95% CI =1.02,1.25),as well as associations on the edge of statistical significance between cumulative externalradiation exposure and all cancers (RRIrem = 1.03,95% CI =.99,1.16), breast cancer(RR/rem =1.05,95% CI =.99,1.12) and hematologic (RR/rem = 1.08,95% CI =.99,1.17). However, no excess breast cancer risk was seen among women employed at Vll-2

--- Page 98 ---
either Y-12 (SMR=73 ,354 observeddeaths, no 95% CI provided) or X-1O (SMR= 82,48 observed deaths, no 95% CI provided). A non-significantly elevated SMR for mouthand buccal cancer was seen among women at X-1O, although based on small number(SMR=148, based on 5 observed deaths), no 95% CIprovided.) Increased SMRs werealso seen among X-1O workers for cancer of the esophagus (SMR=207, 95%CI=67-484),cancer of the kidney (SMR=151, 95% CI=55-328), and mental disorders (SMR=161,95%CI=59-350).Among Y-12 female workers, elevated mortality risk was seen for chronic andunspecified bronchitis (SMR= 149, 95% CI=94-226)and diseases of the genitourinarysystem other than nephritis, kidney infections, female genital organs (SMR= 156, 95%CI=120- 199).a. Y-12Workers employed at the Y-12 plant manufacture nuclear weapons components;historically, the primary route of exposure to radiation at the facility was inhalation ofuranium compounds. Although no film badges were worn in the early years, it wasassumed that external (gamma) exposure was low, and that most exposure was thoughinhaled uranium alpha particles and, to a lesser extent, dermal exposure to beta-emittinguranium daughters. Airborne uranium dust levels were thought to be highest throughSeptember 1945.Mortality among almost 19,000 workers employed at Y-12 during 1943-1947 (followedthrough 1977) was examined by Polednak and Frome (1981). This represents about halfof the workers employed during those years; women, who made up 47% of theworkforce, were not included in this study. Replicating the findings in the overall OakRidge cohort study (see above), Polednak and Frome found an SMR of 1.22 for lungcancer (95% =CI1.10, 1.36). The population was divided into four subgroups, Alphaand Beta Chemistry, all Alpha and Beta Departments, electrical workers and all other.Among these subgroups examined, the highest lung cancer SMR (1.42, 26 deathsobserved) was seen among electrical workers who did maintenance work. No excess lungcancer was seen among the chemical workers "in Alpha and Beta Chemistry" who hadhigher uranium dust exposures, or those who worked in all Alpha and Beta Departments.The fourth group examined "all others" had a small excess risk (SMR=1.13, based on 182lung cancer deaths.White male workers employed at Y-12 between 1947 and 1974 (followed through 1979)are the subject of another series of mortality analyses. Checkoway et al (1988) reportedthat among these workers, there were elevated risks of mortality from cancers of the lung(SMR=1.36, 95% CI 1.09, 1.67, 89 observed deaths) and central nervous system(SMR= 1.80, 95% CI 0.96,3.02, 14 observed deaths). In contrast with earlier studies,individual radiation monitoring data were available for slightly more than half of theworkers in the cohort, and the investigators constructed models to examine therelationship of dose (alpha or gamma, and cumulative level), latency and risk. Dependingupon the model used, the risk of lung cancer among those whose cumulative dose was 5 Vll-3

--- Page 99 ---
or more rem, was more than 4 times higher that of those receiving less than 1 rem. Nocomparable dose-effect trend was seen for cancers of the brain and central nervoussystem Of the 6,781 white male workers who were employed at least 30 days at Y-12,2,222 (33%) has external radiation (gamma) exposure >0-.49 rem, 1,264 (19%) hadbetween .5 and .99 rem, 1504 (22%) had between 1 and 4.99 rem, and 132 (2%) had 5 ormore rem. No analyses by job tityle or department were reported.Although the Checkoway study was relatively large (6,781 cohort members, of whom862 were known to have died), the increases in lung cancer risks associated with thehighest radiation exposure were based on a small number of lung cancer deaths. In spiteoff this, the authors on the study concluded "the observed dose-response trends indicatepotential carcinogenic effects to the lung of relatively low-dose radiation."Loomis and Wolf (1994) extended the follow-up period of this study through 1990.Mortality from lung and brain cancer remained elevated, and the authors report increasedrisk of some lymphatic cancers, as well as cancer of the pancreas, prostate and kidney.An excess in lung cancer mortality was seen (SMR=1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.34, 202 deathsobserved) Further analysis of the lung cancer mortality patterns found that much of thelung cancer excess appeared to be limited to workers who were first employed at Y-12between 1947 and 1954 (SMR=1.27, 161 deaths observed, no 95% CI provided). Theexcess lung cancer mortality first manifested in the 1955-1964 time period, and decreasedafter 1979. The SMIR for lung cancer among female workers was 0.78, based on 5 deaths. Loomis and Wolf conclude: "Lung cancer mortality among these workers warrantscontinued surveillance because of the link between internal alpha radiation exposure andthis disease, but other agents, notably beryllium, also merit consideration as potentialcauses of lung cancer." (p. 131, Loomis and Wolf, 1996)Lung cancer risk at Y-12 has also been examined using a nested case control method,with many of the cases coming from the studies discussed above. Dupree et al (1993;1995) identified 787 lung cancer cases among workers at Y-12 or two other uraniumprocessing facilities (Mallinckrodt Chemical Works and Fernald Feed MaterialsProduction Center) for at least 183 days. Controls were matched to cases on race, gender,date of birth and date of hire (± 3 years), and facility. It was not an uncommon practicefor workers to move from one ABC facility to another. Of the 787 cases, 180, or 23%worked at more than one facility. 567 (72%) were first employed at Y-12 during the1943-1947 period and 142 (18%) after 1947; in total, 7609 (9077%) cases were firstemployed at Y-12. This is of interest, because work at Y-12 contributed the largestamount of exposure, and the longest periods of follow-up after exposure began, in thestudy.The Dupree study (1995) detected a non-statistically significant two-fold excess risk oflung cancer (OR =2.05,95% CI =0.20,20.70) among workers exposed to 25 centigraysor higher. Although there were no indications of a dose-response relationship betweenlung cancer and internal exposure to uranium dust, the data suggested an effect frominternal dose and external radiation among workers hired after age 45; as a result, the Vll-4

--- Page 100 ---
authors felt there findings were not inconsistent with those reported by Checkoway et aT(1988). Using the same exposure data, this study had many of the same limitations asthe other Y-12 studies discussed above In particular, the authors acknowledged thepotential for exposure misclassification, especially among workers from the earlier Y-12employment cohort If this misclassification was random, the effect would likely be toreduce the measured effect of radiation exposure, resulting in an underestimate of theradiation effect.b. ORNLThe mortality experience of ORNL workers has been examined in several studies. Thefirst published study limited to ORNL employees was by Checkoway et al (1985),updated by Wing et al (1991) The later analysis included 8381 men employed between1943 and 1972 followed through 1984 The only significant excess seen overall wasleukemia (SMR =1.63;95% CI =1.08,2.35;therewere 28 observed deaths). Non-significant excesses were seen for cancers of the pancreas (SMR = 1.09;95% CI =0.71,1.61; 25 observed deaths), prostate (SMR = 1.05;95% CI =0.68,1.53; 26 observeddeaths) and brain!CNS (SMR = 1.04;95% CI =0.58,1.72; 15 observed deaths), alongwith lymphosacrcomalreticulosarcoma (SMR = 1.05;95% CI =0.48,1.99; 9 observeddeaths). Using internal comparisons, the investigators found that all cause mortalityappeared to be related to radiation dose, a finding that was not seen in the earlier study ofthe same cohort by Checkoway et al, perhaps because of the shorter follow-up time of theearlier studies.This radiation effect was pnmanly associated with cancer mortality, taking SES intoaccount and with a 20 year time lag, the authors found an approximately 5% excess riskof cancer mortality for every lOmSv (1 rem) of dose (p=.OO1). This estimate issubstantially higher than the radiation effect estimated from data gathered from survivorsof the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear blasts. Among specific cancers, the authors a 5%excess lung cancer mortality risk for each 10 rnSv (p=.O6), and a 9% excess for leukemia(p=.44).The differences between these results and those from the Japanese survivor cohortsunderscore the limitations and uncertainties of dose-effect estimates. While there are fewif any environmental dose-effect relationships about which we have more and better datathan we do for radiation, dose-effect models drawn from different populations haveprovided discordant models. Differences between estimates, and model are probablyattributable to incomplete or inaccurate exposure measurement, or uncontrolledconfounding. It is unlikely, however, that studies in the United States will providesignificant clarification of the questions raised by these differences, because the mortalityexperience of most of the major US radiation-exposed populations have already beenexamined and analyzed.A subsequent analysis (Wing et aT 1993) of the ORNL cohort replicated these sameresults after adjustment for the potential effects of exposure to beryllium, lead andmercury, as well as for selection biases associated with war-related employment patterns.

Richardson and Wing (1999) followed this cohort through 1990, and reported that,lagging the data, radiation doses received after age 45 appear (7% per 10 mSv, SE=2.2)to have a greater impact on cancer mortality risk than exposures that occur at youngerages (5% per 10 mSv, SE=1 .5). Further, they reported a positive association betweenradiation dose after age 45 and risk of non-malignant respiratory disease (5% per 10 mSv,SE=2.9).This age effect has been suggested in other studies as well. Wing et al (2000) conducted acase control study of workers who dies of multiple myeloma at four facilities, includingORNL. While lifetime cumulative radiation dose was not associated with increased riskof multiple myeloma mortality, exposures at older ages appear to increase risk.Wilkinson (2000) examined mortality among female workers employed at ORNL, andfound that excesses of hematologic cancer (SMR = 1.25,95% CI =1.07,1.47), andwithin that, for leukemia (SMR = 1.32,95% CI =1.12,1.55). Non-significant excesseswere seen for cancers of the esophagus (SMR = 2.07,95% CI =0.67,4.84), kidney(SMR =1.51,95% CI =0.55,3.28, and mental disorders (SMR = 1.61,95% CI =0.59,3.50).In addition, investigators examined the mortality experience in a combined cohort fromORNL, Hanford and Rocky Flats, publishing several articles on the study. In a 1993publication, for example, Gilbert, Cragle and Wiggs found that cancers of the esophagusand larynx and Hodgkin's Disease was significantly correlated with radiation exposure,with the esophagus and larynx cancer excesses seen primarily among the ORNL workers.Radiation exposure at ORNL also appeared to be associated with an increased risk ofcancer mortality overall (RR=1 .2 per Sv, 90% CI <0, 3.7), with greater effects being seenamong those developing cancer at older ages.1. BerylliumExposure to beryllium was extensive at the Y-12 facility. By July, 2003, more than 4,000current and former Y-12 workers were tested as part of DOE's Chronic BerylliumDisease (CBD) Surveillance Program. Of these 133 (3.3%) were found to have berylliumsensitization. Ninety of the 133 completed follow-up clinical evaluations, with 46 casesof CBD diagnosed in this group.Beryllium exposure appears to have been less common at ORNL The surveillanceprogram has tested 438 current and former ORNL workers, and have found 8 (1.8%)sensitized. No cases of CBD have been diagnosed at ORNL.DOE reports have documented relatively recent exposure to beryllium. The 1996 DOEBeryllium Information Survey Report noted that Y-12 reported 158 exposed workers, andORNL 51. Y- 12 reported that maximum exposure beryllium levels that year exceeded theDOE standard in effect at that time, 2.0 uglm3. Vll-6

MercuryThe mortality experience of workers exposed to mercury at Y-12 was examined in astudy published in 1984 (Cragle et al). Using data from mercury urinalysis testing, thecohort was divided into exposed and non-exposed subcohorts, and the exposed groupfurther divided into high exposure and low exposure groups. No significant mercury-related differences in mortality patterns were detected. As with other Y- 12 studies, theinvestigators found a (non-significant) excess of lung cancer in these workers,(SMR134, 42 deaths observed, p>.0S, no CI provided) but also found a similar excess innon-mercury exposed Y-12 workers (SMR=1.34, 71 observed deaths, p.<.O5), suggestingthat mercury exposure was not associated with detectable mortality excesses in thispopulation. The authors note in the paper, however, that mortality is not the preferredendpoint to use in studies of the effects of mercury exposure.In the middle 1980s, long after the period of high-level exposure to mercury at Y-12 hadoccurred (1953-1965), a study of neurological effects was undertaken by scientistsassociated with the University of Michigan (Albers et al 1988). Clinical examinationswere given to 502 workers, of whom 247 had been exposed 20 to 35 years previously.Urine mercury levels were available for exposed workersBoth peak and cumulative mercury exposure were found to be correlated with each otherand with the presence of selected neurological abnormalities. Workers whose peakexposure exceeded O/6mgIL were found to have decreased strength, coordination andsensation, as well as increased tremor and prevalence of Babinski and snout reflexes.Workers with clinical neuropathy had significantly higher peak exposure levels(0.85mg/L vs. 0.61 mgIL) than normal workers. Mercury exposure duration was notcorrelated with these conditions.Ten years later, a follow-up study was conducted involving 104 mercury-exposedworkers and 101 non-exposed workers drawn from the same population (Letz et al 2000).For the most part, mercury exposure had ended 30 years before the clinical examinationswere performed and the mean age of the study subjects was, at the time of examination,71 years. A range of peripheral nerve function outcomes, principally definedelectrophysiologically, were found to be statistically significantly associated withcumulative mercury exposure, as were the results of the hand-eye coordination test andpostural tremor. Importantly, they found no relationship between mercury exposure anddementia or any measure of cognitive function. The authors note that these associationswere observed despite greater mortality in the exposed (compared with the unexposed)group, and sizable loss to follow-up.3. AsbestosWhile the occurrence of asbestos-related disease has not been studies in productionworkers at ORNL or Y-12, data from the medical surveillance program of Oak Ridgeconstruction workers strongly suggests that asbestos-related disease will be detected inproduction workers in these facilities. According to Dement et al (2003), 19% of Vll-7

construction workers employed at one or more of DOE Oak Ridge sites had radiographicabnormalities associated with asbestos exposure4. WeldingMortality among white, male welders employed at Y-12 and ORNL 1943 through 1985was examined in a series of studies (Polednak 1981; Wells, Cragle and Tankersly, 1998).The authors of the 1998 study assert that stainless steel welding was common at Y-12,and that the major contaminants were iron and chromium. Welders at both facilities alsoworked with aluminum The subpopulation employed at Y-12 or ORNL had elevatedrisk of cancer of the prostate (SMR = 2.33,95%CI1.00,4.60) and lung (SMR =1.34,95%CI=0.87,1.98).5.PhosgeneSignificant phosgene exposure occurred in the early years at Y-12. Polednak (1980),then Polednak and Hollis (1985) examined the mortality experience of Y-12 chemicalworkers who worked in departments where daily exposures to phosgene occurred. Aslightly elevated increase (SMR=1.21, 95% CI = 0.86,1.65) in all-cause mortality wasseen among male workers who were acutely exposed to high levels of phosgene, with anSMR of 2.66 (95% CI =0.86,6.22) for non-malignant respiratory disease. Included inthis is at least one death that appears to be directly attributable to acute phosgeneexposure.6. Central Nervous System (CNS) CancersA study examining the relationship of CNS cancer with radiation and chemical exposurewas conducted using the case-control method. The investigators selected study subjectsfrom Y-12 and ORNL. There was no clear association with either radiation or any of 26chemical exposures, although an increased risk of CNS cancer (OR = 7.0,95%CI=1.2,41) was observed among those employed for more than 20 years (Carpenter et al, 1987;Carpenter et al, 1988).
