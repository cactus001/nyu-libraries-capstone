THE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 1 DECEMBER 2020 THE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA GUIDANCE NOTE SERIES DATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION RESPONSIBLE APPROACHES TO DATA SHARING KEY TAKEAWAYS: • Open sharing of timely and accurate data is essential to effective and efficient humanitarian response. How humanitarian organizations approach data sharing directly relates to trust and cooperation in the sector. • As the humanitarian data ecosystem grows, the opportunities and risks of sharing data become clearer, prompting organizations to explore more limited approaches to data sharing. • Humanitarian organizations widely recognize the sensitivity of personal data: its exposure has a high likelihood of causing harm. The majority of non-personal data is safe to share openly, but non-personal data can also be sensitive and should be handled with caution. • Humanitarian organizations should take into account four factors when deciding whether to share non-personal data: (i) utility; (ii) sensitivity; (iii) human and technical capacity; and (iv) governance. • Humanitarian organizations should identify and compare all available approaches for data sharing, considering the most open approach first and working down to more limited approaches as necessary. INTRODUCTION The use and exchange of data have become core functions of humanitarian organizations. Staff regularly need to decide whether and how to share their organization’s data, even if their role is not primarily focused on data or information management. Beyond individual organizations, the interest in the sharing and use of data generated in humanitarian action has also grown. In response to this interest, the humanitarian sector has seen a surge in data generation and sharing in recent years. “ Accurate data is the lifeblood of good policy and decision-making. Obtaining it, and sharing it across hundreds of organizations, in the middle of a humanitarian emergency , is complicated and time-consuming — but it is absolutely crucial. ” - United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres at the opening of the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data in The Hague in December 2017 Open sharing of timely and accurate data is essential to effective and efficient humanitarian response and should remain a key objective for the sector. For example, the COVID-19 epidemiological data1 compiled and shared daily by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering has been 1 Access the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases Data on HDX.

THE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 2 DECEMBER 20202 “From August 2016 through August 2020 (the period for which the data is available), growth in monthly users from HRP+ countries was 943% compared to 566% across all countries.” From the HDX Case Study, September 2020. 3 These include, for example, the IASC Sub-Group on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action, the Protection Information Management initiative, and the Responsible Data for Children initiative, among others. 4 For a better understanding of the challenge facing humanitarian organizations when sharing data specifically in protracted humanitarian crises, see ALNAP , Data Collection, Analysis and Use in Protracted Humanitarian Crises, June 2020. 5 Learn more about the Centre’s risk mitigation process for microdata, ‘Statistical Disclosure Control’ or SDC in the Learning Path on the topic.integrated in a number of dashboards and situation reports for decision-makers across the humanitarian sector since the outset of the pandemic. By December 2020, this dataset had been downloaded more than 320,000 times from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) since it was first published on the platform in January that year. The utility of open data to humanitarian practitioners is further underlined by the fact that usage of HDX in countries with a Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) in place has grown much faster than usage in other locations. 2 How humanitarian organizations approach data sharing directly relates to trust and cooperation in the sector. Maintaining trust within the data ecosystem is critical to the sustainability of data sharing and relates to issues such as the quality of the data, the level to which the data will be secured after sharing and the responsible use of data by the recipient. Because data in the humanitarian sector often relates to the most at-risk populations, managing and sharing it warrants caution. Many humanitarian organizations have developed or updated their guidance, governance and practices to support different aspects of data responsibility: the safe, ethical and effective management of data. The sector has also seen an increasing number of collaborative efforts to improve data responsibility beyond individual organizations. 3 Still, as the humanitarian system learns more about the risks associated with data sharing, organizations face more complex challenges in sharing this data responsibly.4 This guidance note aims to support decision-making around the sharing of non-personal data in humanitarian settings. It explains data sensitivity, provides common examples of sensitive non-personal data, and explains an approach to information and data sensitivity classification in humanitarian settings. It also offers a framework that organizations can use to weigh four factors that help determine whether data can be shared and explains common approaches for doing so responsibly. Options for Data Sharing on the Humanitarian Data Exchange When the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) was launched in 2014, it held close to 900 datasets, shared by a handful of ‘early adopter’ organizations. By the end of 2020, that number had grown to over 18,000 datasets. Only approved organizations are able to share data on the platform. They can make data available publicly to anyone who visits the site or privately to only the members of their organizations. In 2017, the HDX team added another option for data sharing: HDX Connect. This feature enables organizations to only publish the metadata, with the underlying data available upon request. If access is granted, the data is shared bilaterally without passing through the HDX platform. For example, Ground Truth Solutions use HDX Connect to provide access to COVID-19 Community Perceptions Data collected in Iraq. As part of its quality assurance process, the HDX team also runs a disclosure risk assessment on any resource added to the platform that contains microdata. The HDX team does this because it may be possible to re-identify individuals or expose confidential information even after direct identifiers have been removed from microdata. 5 Some organizations on HDX have become more oriented towards controlled access to their data, either due to the sensitive nature of the data, increased pressure to track and report on how the data is used, or resource constraints related to operational sustainability. HDX will always support different ways of sharing data — however, open access remains the best option for the majority of data that is generated for humanitarian response.

THE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 3 DECEMBER 20206 Personal data should not be shared openly , and management of personal data should always comply with national and regional data protection laws, or with internal data protection policies in the case of organizations covered by privileges and immunities. 7 UNOCHA (2019), Working Draft Data Responsibility Guidelines.UNDERSTANDING DATA SENSITIVITY Humanitarian organizations widely recognize the sensitivity of personal data6: its exposure has a high likelihood of causing harm. This understanding does not yet widely exist for non-personal data, which typically covers the following three categories in humanitarian settings: Data about the context in which a response is taking place (e.g. legal frameworks, political, social and economic conditions, infrastructure, etc.) and the humanitarian situation (e.g security incidents, protection risks, drivers of the situation or crisis). Data about the people affected by the situation and their needs, the threats and vulnerabilities they face, and their capacities. Data about humanitarian response actors and their activities (e.g. as reported in 3W/4W/5W). The majority of this data is safe to share openly. However, non-personal data can also be sensitive. Examples of sensitive non-personal data include data on groups experiencing gender-based violence or the location of ethnic minorities in conflict settings. Such data is considered sensitive because it enables the identification of groups of individuals by demographically defining factors, such as ethnicity, gender, age, occupation, religion or location of origin. Non-personal data can also create risk in other ways, for example by exposing the location of medical facilities in areas where they are prone to attack. As the awareness of the risk associated with sharing such data continues to grow, some organizations are turning from a focus on open data to more controlled sharing. Many organizations have information and data sensitivity classifications (see figure 1 below) that define which data falls into which category of sensitivity in order to facilitate responsible data management. These classifications may also be developed as a collective exercise to help organizations align around what constitutes sensitive data in their context and identify the appropriate disclosure or dissemination methods for different data types depending on their sensitivity. Information and Data Sensitivity Classification7 Sensitivity DefinitionInformation and Data Sensitivity Classification Low or No Information or data that, if disclosed or accessed without proper authorization, are unlikely to cause any harm or negative impacts to affected people and/or humanitarian actors.Public Moderate Information or data that, if disclosed or accessed without proper authorization, are likely to cause minor harm or negative impacts and/or be disad - vantageous for affected people and/or humani - tarian actors.Restricted High Information or data that, if disclosed or accessed without proper authorization, are likely to cause serious harm or negative impacts to affected peo - ple and/or humanitarian actors and/or damage to a response.Confidential Severe Information or data that, if disclosed or accessed without proper authorization, are likely to cause severe harm or negative impacts and/or damage to affected people and/or humanitarian actors and/or impede the conduct of the work of a response.Strictly Confidential Figure 1.

THE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 4 DECEMBER 20208 See the Guidance Note on Data Impact Assessments. 9 For data management in the humanitarian sector, risk can be defined as the likelihood and impact of harm resulting from data management. 10 The World Economic Forum, together with Washington University Centre for Information Assurance and Cybersecurity, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network TReNDS and the NYU GovLab, have begun building a repository of data sharing agreements to support the professionalization of this practice through their Contracts for Data Collaboration (C4DC) project. 11 The licenses recommended for data sharing via HDX are listed here: https://data.humdata.org/about/license. 12 For more information about data incident management in humanitarian response, see our Guidance Note on Data Incident Management.Organizational policies and collective governance instruments such as Information Sharing Protocols (ISPs) often include a sensitivity classification and should be the primary points of reference for determining how to manage sensitive data. However, these documents tend to leave room for discretion regarding whether and how to share. This means data sharing can be influenced by personal preferences and skills and may vary across organizations. By taking a more consistent approach to data sharing and ensuring adequate safeguards for sensitive data, organizations can build trust and contribute to more efficient and effective humanitarian response. FOUR FACTORS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER TO SHARE NON-PERSONAL DATA There are four factors humanitarian organizations should take into account when deciding whether to share non-personal data. What is the utility of the data for other stakeholders? The utility of data depends on the level of detail, the number of people or the geographical area covered, its timeliness, and its relevance to analysis and decision-making in humanitarian response. Conduct a Data Impact Assessment (DIA) to help determine the utility of specific data. 8 How sensitive is the data? The sensitivity of data is based on the risk associated with its exposure in a particular context.9 In some response contexts, organizations, clusters/sectors, and system-wide coordination structures also have established data and information sensitivity classifications (see above) that can inform this determination. Conducting a DIA can also help determine the sensitivity of data. For survey results and other forms of microdata, sensitivity is closely linked to the risk of re-identification, which can be determined by applying a disclosure risk assessment. What human and technical capacity do the organizations sharing and using the data have?Both the organization sharing data and the organization(s) receiving and using the data should have sufficient human and technical capacity for responsible data management. This includes staff availability, data literacy, technical infrastructure and related resources. In environments with low connectivity, bandwidth-heavy data sharing methods may not be appropriate. For contexts with known security risks, data should typically be shared through more limited approaches. Which governance instruments apply?Common data governance instruments include ISPs, data sharing agreements for bilateral data sharing and licenses or terms of use for public data sharing. 11 These instruments should inform how data is shared in a safe, ethical and effective manner. In some situations, governance will need to be developed for the selected data sharing approach. Governance instruments can address a range of topics and special provisions, but should always include the following elements: (a) the purpose and scope of sharing; (b) any limitations to how data should be managed after sharing; (c) roles and responsibilities throughout the sharing process; and (d) procedures for data incident management. 12

THE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 5 DECEMBER 202013 Not all tools and platforms in this overview have been vetted by the UN Secretariat. Always consult the relevant Information Technology advisors before using a new tool. 14 UNHCR’s MicroData Library. 15 IFRC’s GO Platform. 16 Within humanitarian responses, one of the most common ways to share data is via email attachments. When sharing data via email, always take the necessary security precautions. This way of sharing is responsible in some cases, but there are often more suitable ways to share data. For information on how to encrypt email, see for example: https://www .cloudwards.net/how-to-encrypt-your-emails/. 17 The Open Algorithms Project. 18 Aircloak Insights. 19 To learn more about homomorphic encryption as a way of sharing the value of sensitive data, see here: htps://www .microsoft.com/en-us/research/ project/homomorphic-encryption/ and here: https://www . wired.com/story/google-private-join-compute-database-encryption/. 20 To learn more about multi-party computation, see here: https://www .tno.nl/en/focus-areas/information-communication-technology/roadmaps/ data-sharing/secure-multi-party-computation/.IDENTIFY AND COMPARE APPROACHES Organizations should determine the best approach to data sharing based on the four factors above. These approaches range from open sharing to maximize the benefit of data, to more limited approaches such as bilateral data sharing or only sharing data insights. The table below contains an overview of different approaches to data sharing and offers examples of some commonly used tools and platforms. Approaches to SharingApproaches, Tools and Platforms for Data Sharing in Humanitarian Response 13 Open Access Sharing data publicly is the most open approach to sharing, allowing unmediated access to anyone.Limited Access Limiting access to data still allows select partners to use the data as long as they meet certain requirements.Bilateral Sharing Bilateral sharing is the most limited way in which data can be shared, directly with one partner.No Data Sharing Data that should not be shared at all can still offer value to partners, if they are allowed to query the data remotely or benefit from it indirectly. Common Tools and Platforms Organization data platforms HDX Open ListservsHDX Private UNHCR Microdata Library 14 IFRC GO15 Cluster/Sector Sharing Closed mailing listsHDX Connect Email16 DropboxOPAL17 Aircloak18 Homomorphic encryption19 Multi-Party Computation 20 In comparing these different approaches, always consider the most open approach first and work down to more limited approaches as necessary. Different data types will require different ways of sharing. For example, large datafiles will require specialized infrastructure and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are suitable for data that is published in the same format on a regular basis. Because technologies for data sharing continue to evolve, organizations should regularly revisit and compare available data sharing approaches.

The Centre for Humanitarian Data ('the Center'), together with key partners, is publishing a series of eight guidance notes on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action over the course of 2019 and 2020. The Guidance Note series follows the publication of the OCHA Data Responsibility Guidelines in March 2019. Through the series, the Centre aims to provide additional guidance on specific issues, processes and tools for data responsibility in practice. This series is made possible with the generous support of the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO).Unlocking V alue from Data Without Sharing It: The Querying Approach A relatively new approach to utilizing data without transferring the data itself is ‘querying’ . Querying allows third parties to formulate specific questions to be asked of the data without accessing it directly. The resulting insights can then be checked for sensitivity and any other issues by the holder of the data. This approach avoids transfers of data which can cause legal and ethical concerns, while still allowing for valuable insights to be used for public good. In implementing a querying approach, it is critical to establish governance in the form of instructions and boundaries regarding the queries that may be sent, in order to prevent retrieval of sensitive information by posing a combination of questions. 21 Vetting users as well as their questions should always be a key step in the process around this type of approach. Commercial solutions to set up querying approaches include Aircloak Insights, which acts as a ‘proxy between analysts and the sensitive data they need to work with. ’ Another querying tool is the Open Algorithms (OPAL) platform. This tool was specifically developed for the humanitarian and development sectors and is currently being piloted in Colombia. Data Sharing Methods at the Joint IDP Profiling Service In 2019, the Joint IDP Profiling Service (JIPS) was awarded a grant by the UNHCR Innovation Fund to research advanced data science methods for data anonymization. JIPS studied methods such as Multi-Party Computation and Homomorphic Encryption and worked with technical experts at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Flowminder and the Government of Colombia National Statistics Office. In close collaboration with Flowminder and building on their Flowkit, JIPS developed a prototype querying approach to enable humanitarian and development actors to safely access and query sensitive individual-level data without needing to share it. The team developed a technical workflow to demonstrate the viability of this approach with one single data provider and mapped the problems and limitations in case of multiple data providers. Organizations are encouraged to share their experience in promoting responsible data sharing with the Centre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org.
