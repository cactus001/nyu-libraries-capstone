Each State must have a State Performance Plan (SPP) to evaluate the State's efforts to meet the requirements and purposes of the implementation of IDEA. The SPP is a six-year plan which describes New York State's performance on 20 indicators. States must report annually to the public on the performance of the State in an Annual Performance Report (APR) and each school district against the State's targets. New York State's SPP and the APR that describe these indicators in detail are available at http://www.p12.nysed.gov/specialed/spp/. The following report reflects only quantifiable data collected by the State. Since performance of a school district in any indicator may be the result of unique circumstances within a district, readers are encouraged to consider information provided by the district's administration in interpreting these data.
