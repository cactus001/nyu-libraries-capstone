4 Managed by UT-Battelle for the U.S. Department of Energy Mercury Chamber Considerations, July 2011Gravity Drain Requires Flow Control •Bulk flow exits dump via overflow drains •Gravity drain intended to remain closed until end-of run, but this liquid becomes static •Decay heating requires gravity drain to have flow control Mercury JetProton Beam Mercury OverflowGravity Drain Flow Control Overflow drains WC Shielding

5 Managed by UT-Battelle for the U.S. Department of Energy Mercury Chamber Considerations, July 2011Mercury Chamber Basics •Chamber serves as both jet and beam dumps –Chamber must encompass the nozzle tip •No openings into chamber during operation –Mercury flows in a closed loop –Likely will be double-walled for mercury containment, possibly water cooled •No embedded sensors •Gravity drain of mercury required •Penetrations (ports) into chamber –Nozzle –Hg drains (overflow and maintenance) –Vents (in and out) –Beam windows (upstream and downstream) –Cooling?

7 Managed by UT-Battelle for the U.S. Department of Energy Mercury Chamber Considerations, July 2011Mercury Chamber Ports •Chamber requires several ports •Sizes likely to increase due to remote handling requirements Vents (In/Out) Jet Nozzle Overflow DrainsMaintenance Drain (Valved)Beam Pipe

8 Managed by UT-Battelle for the U.S. Department of Energy Mercury Chamber Considerations, July 2011 Chamber Relative to Existing Coils •Sized to locate drain pipes below resistive magnets •No beam pipe shown •Severely impacts tungsten shielding •Chamber shape requires significant increase in complexity •Integrating resistive magnets and chamber into a single module likely to be required

9 Managed by UT-Battelle for the U.S. Department of Energy Mercury Chamber Considerations, July 2011Upstream Solenoids Affect Design •Long piping required •Remote removal / insertion more difficult •Beam trajectory impacted –Dictates the location of upstream accelerator –Ramifications of inaccurate field map? •More utility connections interfere with beam path
