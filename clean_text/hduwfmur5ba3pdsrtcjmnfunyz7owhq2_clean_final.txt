Continuation of DOT-SP 14149 (20 th Rev.) September 11, 2015 d. System Standardization (Calibration) (1) Ultrasonic Examination (UE) System Standardiza tion. Prior to retesting each specific cylinder design an d type, the UE system must be standardized for testin g by using a standard reference. The standard reference must be similar (material of construction, size, wall thickness, etc.) to the identified cylinders to be tested. Standardization of the UE system must be performed by using a relevant reference cylinder th at is described in paragraph 7.c. of this special permit. The standardization of the UE system is as follows: (i) A reference cylinder with an artificial defect made to represent area corrosion must be placed in the UE system. The UE system must be standardized t o indicate rejection for an area equal or greater tha n the machined surface for the cylinder (0.70 in 2). Where the wall thickness is reduced below t m, a straight ultrasound beam must be used to measure th e wall thickness of the machined area. (ii) A reference cylinder with a FBH made to represent an isolated pit must be placed in the UE system. The FBH must be detected by a minimum of tw o shear wave beams that strike the FBH from opposite sides (e.g. the first shear wave direction is from top to bottom of the cylinder and the second shear wave direction is from the bottom to top). The UE gain must be increased until the signal from FBH is maximized at 80 percent of the screen height . (iii) A reference cylinder with circumferential notches made to represent line corrosion must be placed in the UE system. Each internal and external notch must be detected by a minimum of one shear wave beam. The UE gain must be increased until the signal from each notch is maximized at 80 percent o f the screen height. (iv) A reference cylinder with longitudinal notche s to represent a longitudinal sidewall crack (LSC) must be placed in the UE system. Each internal and external notch must be detected by a minimum of two shear wave beams that strike the LSC from opposite directions (e.g. the first shear wave direction is clockwise and second shear wave direction is

--- Page 6 ---
Continuation of DOT-SP 14149 (20 th Rev.) September 11, 2015 counterclockwise). The UE gain must be increased until the signal from the notch is maximized at 80 percent of the screen height. (2) Eddy Current Examination (EE) Equipment Standardization - The EE equipment must be standard ized for each type of DOT 3AL cylinder, using the standa rd reference ring that includes simulated neck crack notch. The EE system is considered standardized whe n the probe is threaded into the mid-length of standardization ring and the sensitivity adjusted t o produce a spike that crossed the gate (2 screen hig h) as it passes over the simulated neck crack notch. The details of the equipment standardization for ea ch type of DOT 3AL cylinder must be obtained from the manufacturer’s instruction manual included as part of this standardization procedure. e. Test Procedures. (1) During the test, each cylinder must be examined by the standardized (calibrated) UE system using a rel evant set-up that is described in paragraph 7.d. of this special permit. (2) For each cylinder tested, all 5 scan passes must be performed as they are described in paragraph 7.d . (3) A UE system that is set-up to perform a 5 pass scan may perform a 3 pass scan if the longitudinal and circumferential (clockwise) angle beam scans do not detect a rejectable flaw. (4) A copy of the operating test procedure (as authorized in writing by the AAHMS) for performing UE, EE and enhanced visual inspection of cylinder necks un der the terms of this special permit must be at each fa cility performing ultrasonic examination. At a minimum, th is procedure must include: (i) A description of the test set-up; test parameters; transducer model number, frequency, and size; transducer assembly used; system standardization procedures and threshold gain used during the test; and other pertinent information.

Continuation of DOT-SP 14149 (20 th Rev.) September 11, 2015 (ii) Requirement for the equipment standardization to be performed at the end of the test interval (cal-out), after 200 cylinders or four hours, which ever occurs first. This cal-out can be considered the cal-in for the next interval during continuous operation. Cylinders examined during the interval between cal-in and cal-out must be quarantined unti l an acceptable cal-out has been performed. An acceptable cal-out occurs when the calibration cylinder is examined and all required features are revealed without changing examination settings. If an acceptable cal-out does not occur, if any equipment that affects the UE results are replaced or altered (such as a search unit or coaxial cable etc.) or when a loss of power occurs, all cylinders examined since the last successful calibration must be re-examined. Additionally, standardization of test equipment shall be performed when any of the following occurs: the beginning of each work shift; when the cylinder under test has dimensions that exceed the allowable ranges of the reference cylinder; when there is a change of operator(s); if any equipment that affects the UE results are replaced or altered (such as a search unit or coaxial cable etc.) or when a loss of power occurs; and at the end of each work shift. (5) A written copy of the most recent approved o perating test procedures must be provided to a DOT represe ntative when requested. Any change to the written procedu res or in UE or EE equipment (software or hardware), oth er than as supplied by the original equipment manufacture r, must be submitted to and approved by AAHMS prior to implementation. (6) The equipment may not allow testing of a cylin der unless the system has been properly standardized (calibrated). (7) The rotational speed of a reference cylinder m ust be such that all simulated defects are adequately dete cted, measured and recorded. (8) The rotational speed of the cylinder under UE must not exceed the rotational speed used during the standardization.
