Pursuant to 278.280(2), which directs the Commission to prescribe rules and regulations for the performance of services by utilities, the Commission has promulgated Administrative Regulation 807 KAR 5:006, Section 24, which requires all utilities to adopt and execute a safety program. Commission Staff submitted an Incident Investigation Report (“Report”) to the Commission regarding this incident, which is attached as Appendix A. The report alleges that, on July 20, 2011, at 15500 Bridal Gate Drive in Louisville, Kentucky, Matthew Christy, an employee of The Fishel Company (“Fishel”), a contractor for LG&E, sustained burn injuries as a result of an accident while making repairs to an underground residential distribution (“URD”). According to the Report, on the day of the incident, the victim was working under the supervision of another Fishel employee, Jimmy Wiliams. Both Mr. Christy and Mr. Williams were making repairs to a 12 kV underground primary conductor. An arc occurred while the crew was making repairs in a pull box at this location. Mr. Chirsty and Mr. Williams had been at the site on June 30, 2011 to locate the fault on the conductor, at which time they isolated and stood off the damaged conductor at Transformer #85782. At the time of the incident, they were preparing to replace the damaged conductor. According to Fishel’s report and the statement of Mr. Williams, the crew used the voltage detector at the elbow terminator in Transformer #85782 and it showed no voltage. At that time, Mr. Williams instructed Mr. Christy to open the pull box, remove the conductors from the pull box, and test the conductors. According to Fishel’s report, Mr. Christy tested the conductors twice. According to LG&E’s report, Mr. Williams stated that Mr. Christy put on his 20,000 volt gloves and sleeves to do the -2- Case No. 2012-00103

--- Page 2 ---
testing. After the testing, both LG&E and Fishel state that Mr. Christy removed his gloves and sleeves to make repairs to the conductor. According to LG&E’s seven-day report, Mr. Christy pulled the elbow off the feed-through and touched it to the eye bolt on the feed-through causing an arc. Mr. Chirsty received injuries to both hands and his left foot. Based on Commission Staffs investigation of the incident, information contained in the Report, and the information provided by LG&E in its seven-day summary report (Attachment A to the Report), Commission Staff alleges that LG&E has vioiated the following provisions of the NESC: 2007 NESC Section 42, Rule 420.C-General Rules for Employees-Personal General Precautions-Safeguarding Oneself and Others Employees who work on or in the vicinity of energized lines shall consider all of the effects of their actions, taking into account their own safety as well as the safety of other employees on the job site, or on some other part of the affected electric system, the property of others, and the public in general.

Information From: Keith McBride Department: Safety Company: LG&E/KU. Jim Dimas Legal LG&E/KU Kelly Gibson Legal LG&E/KU Rich Mauldin Area Manager Fishel Incident Description: On July 20th, 201 1 Public Service Commission (PSC) staff was notified by LG&E's safety department that a Fishel employee was injured while making repairs to a (12 Kv) underground primary conductor. According to LG&E's safety department, Mr. Christy and Mr. Williams (crew), who work for Fishel (L-G&E contractor), were repairing a section of underground residential distribution (URD) located at 15500 Bridal Gate Drive. An arc occurred while the crew was making repairs in a pull box at this location thus injuring Mr. Christy. Mr. Christy was transported to University Hospital and admitted overnight for observation. PSC investigator conducted a site investigation on July 20th, 201 1 at 15500 Bridal Gate Drive, Jeffersontown, Kentucky. Information from the site investigation is listed in the findings section of this report. Findings: During the PSC incident site investigation on July 20th, 2011 at 15500 Bridal Gate Drive, Louisville, Kentucky; photographs were taken at and around the incident site location. Photographs taken by PSC investigator note burns and damage to the underground primary conductor, feed through, and elbow terminators at the incident PSC 2 of 285

--- Page 10 ---
site/pull box. Photographs were taken of the corresponding transformers and pull box near the incident site which is shown in the URD system diagram. Also photographs of the voltage detection device (A. B. Chance) the crew stated they used to determine if the conductor was de-energized. See Attachment D; PSC Photographs on pages 246 - 272 and Attachment A; Utility Photographs on pages 15 - 29. According to LG&E and Fishel personnel at the incident investigation site, the crew was preparing to replace the damaged conductor at 15500 Bridle Gate Drive. The crew verified the conductor was still isolated and stood off on a parking bushing at transformer 85782. The crew had been at the site on June 30th, 2011 to locate the fault on the conductor. The damaged conductor was located at transformer (85782) which provides service to a home at 15500 Bridle Gate Drive. See Attachment A; Utility Photographs on page 21. According to LG&E and Fishel personnel at the incident site, the crew checked the transformer 85782 located at 15500 Bridal Gate Drive to confirm the conductor being replaced was still stood off on the parking bushing as they had left when locating the fault on June 30th, 2011. According to Fishel's report and Mr. Williams, the crew used the voltage detector at the elbow terminator (elbow) in transformer 85782, and it showed no voltage. The crew then walked back to the pull box located at the incident site. Mr. Williams instructed Mr. Christy to open the pull box, remove the conductors from the pull box, and test the conductors. Mr. Christy tested the conductors twice according to Fishel's report. According to LG&E's report, Mr. Williams stated Mr. Christy put his 20,000 volt gloves and sleeves on to test the conductor to be replaced See Attachment A; Utility Photographs on pages 15 and 16. Mr. Williams said he walked back to the truck and did not see the incident, but did hear the arc. He turned to notice Mr. Christy fall to the ground, Mr. Williams dialed 911 at that time. According to LG&E's investigation report, Mr. Christy received injuries to both hands and his left foot. Mr. Christy was released the next day on .July 2Is', 2011. Mr. Christy was interviewed by Keith McBride on July 22"d, 201 1 at the Team Fishel office. According to LG&E personnel at the incident site, Mr. Christy checked the conductor at the pull box at which he was working with the A. B. Chance voltage detection device. The device indicated the conductor was not energized. During the site investigation LG&E personnel visually inspected the voltage detection device used by the Fishel employee and noticed that the indicating display was inconsistent. It was also noted that a test date could not be found on the A. B. Chance voltage detection device. See Attachment A; Utility Photographs on pages 22 - 25 and Attachment D; PSC Photographs on pages 246 - 248 of the A. B. Chance Testing Device. On September 8'h, 201 1 PSC investigator requested documentation showing the required testing on the A. B. Chance voltage detector used the day of the incident. LG&E's response; as far as yearly testing, only when the tester is either damaged, found to not be working or the ability of the tester has come into question should the tester be sent out for testing. There are no requirements for yearly testing. See Attachment E; LG&E's email response on page 275. On September gth, 201 1 PSC investigator requested that the voltage detection device be tested to determine if it could have been giving a false reading. The test results are listed in the supplemental report dated September 7'h, 2011. See Attachment B; Utility Supplemental Report on page 65. LG&E and Fishel staff stated Mr. Christy had removed his gloves and sleeves to make repairs on the conductor. According to LG&E's seven-day report, Mr. Christy pulled the elbow off the feed through and touched it to the eye bolt (which was grounded) on the feed through causing an arc. After reviewing the information provided in the seven-day report dated July 26Ih, 201 I, and the utility supplemental report dated September 7'h, 2011, it was still not clear how the circuit was fed at the incident site. The PSC investigator requested a follow-up meeting with LG&E's safety department and Fishel personnel to discuss how the circuit was fed and to clariv why this circuit was still energized at the incident site. The meeting took place on October 6'h, 2011 at LG&E's East Service Center. LG&E's safety personnel had a diagram of the incident site drawn on the PSC 3 of 285

--- Page 11 ---
board showing how the circuit was fed before and after the incident. According to the diagram, the damaged conductor ran through the pull box located between transformers 85513 and 85782. See Attachment C; Utility Addendum Report on pages 242 and 243. According to the diagram, the pull box between transformers 85513 and 85782 should have been the location to make repairs on the damaged conductor On November 1 Olh, 201 1 it was noted that the Canterbrook Farms schematic had been revised on July 27Ih, 201 1. See Attachment C; Schematic dated July 27‘h, 2011 on page 237. PSC investigator sent an email request to clarify why this schematic was updated on July 271h, 201 1, and to provide a copy of the print before the changes made on July 27Ih, 201 1 showing the circuit feeding from transformer 84746 to the pull box located in front of 15500 Bridal Gate Drive. See Attachment E; Schematic dated February 12‘h, 1999 on page 281 and Attachment G; Overhead Image of Canterbrook Farms Subdivision on page 285. It is still unclear why the Fishel crew went to the pull box located at the entrance of 15500 Bridal Gate Drive and not the pull box located between transformers 8551 3 and 85782. It appears that the identifying numbers at the incident location could have been incorrect, and that the diagram on how the URD circuit fed at this location was possibly misleading. Refer to the utility photographs taken at the incident site. See Attachment A; Utility Photographs on pages 15 - 21. One of the elbow terminators received extensive damage, and it is difficult to determine the tag number. One number on the tag is legible, but is the number on the burnt tag a 6 or 9. An email was sent to LG&E’s safety department asking if they could indentify the damaged tag. LG&E indentified the tag as 84746, and stated it was associated with a transformer located on Pasafino Court See Attachment E; Email Correspondence on pages 278 - 280 and Canterbrook Farms Schematic dated 2/12/99 on page 281. The schematic dated 2/12/99 shows the URD circuit going to the pull box located at the entrance of 15500 Bridal Gate Drive and not to transformer 85782 as shown in the schematic dated July 27‘h, 201 1, and as documented in Attachment C, Utility Addendum Report. It is apparent that mapping/documentation could have been misleading, confusing and/or inaccurate and could have been a contributing factor to this incident The important aspect of this incident is the Fishel crew failed to follow proper grounding procedures after using the A. B Chance voltage detection device to determine if the conductor was de-energized. When conductors or equipment are to be de-energized, then the final step to insure conductors or equipment are de-energized is to follow proper grounding procedures. LG&E’s grounding procedures can be viewed in Attachment A; Utility Seven-Day Report on pages 31 - 60. The NESC has grounding requirements also and, if applicable, shall be followed. Following these grounding procedures could have prevented the injuries to Mr. Christy. The crew did not follow proper grounding procedures at the work site. Investigators Comments: During the follow-up visit with LG&E and Fishel personnel on October 6‘h, 2011 the terminology describing Mr. Williams as an apprentice Ill was discussed, and Mr. Williams was recognized as Mr. Christy’s supervisor. PSC investigator expressed concerns about an apprentice supervising an apprentice. See Attachment B; Utility Supplemental Report on page 72 (VIII SUPERVISION OF APPRENTICES). LG&E and Fishel personnel explained Mr. Williams was qualified to work on the URD system because of his past work experience and training, but did not have adequate experience with overhead construction. Therefore, his title is listed as an Apprentice Ill with Fishel. LG&E staff suggested that Fishel review the company’s terminology/definition of a supervisor/person in charge. PSC investigator agreed with LG&E’s suggestion. PSC 4 of 285

Type of Report Keith McBricle Investigator 11-ED-E-021 Repoit Number Julv 20,201 1 Date of Incident Reference: Fishel Employee injured and admitted to hospital Location: 1 500 Bridle Gate Drive Louisville, Jefferson County, Ken tucky 40299 Case Summarv On July 20,201 1 at approximdtely 1 :15 P.M. Jimmy Williams, Apprentice III for Team Fishel and Matthew Christy, Apprentice I, for Team Fishel, were on a job site at 15500 Bridle Gate Drive, Louisville, Kentucky. The job consisted of identifying and replacing a section of lJRD cable that was found to be damaged. During this job, Matthew Christy received a shock and burn. Mr. Christy was admitted to the hospital for overnight observation. Ken Sheridan, Manager of Distribution Operational and Public Safety, notified the Kentucky Public Service Coinmission of the incident and subsequent overnight hospital stay, Investigation On April 17,201 1, LG&E Distribution Control Center (DCC) received an outage ticket along Bridle Gate Drive. DCC dispatched a Trouble Technician to the area. The Trouble Technician found that there was a bad section of URD cable. The Trouble Technician was able to restore service by switching. On July 20,201 1 at approximately 1 : 15 P.M. Jiininy Williams, Apprentice I11 for Team Fishel and Matthew Christy, Apprentice I for Teain Fishel, were on a job site at 15500 Bridle Gate Drive, Louisville, Kentucky. The job consisted of replacing the section of bad URD cable that had been previously identified. According to Mr. Williams, through interviews at the scene and the next day, he and Mr. Christy had been at this location approximately two weeks prior to test and locate the bad section of URD cable. Mr. Williams stated that during their testing, they found the 1 PSC 10 of 285

--- Page 18 ---
damaged spot on the URD cable just inside of the transformer feeding 15500 Bridle Gate Drive. Mr. Williams stated that each elbow of the bad section of cable had been stood off on parking bushings inside of the pad-mount transformers. Mr. Williams stated that once on the job site on July 20,201 1 to replace the bad section of URD cable, he and Mr. Christy had a job briefing and went to work. Mr. Williams checked the transformer feeding 15500 Bridle Gate Drive to confirm the elbow on the bad cable was still in a parked location. Mr. Williams removed the test cap on the back of the elbow and tested for voltage. 1.. Williams stated that the tester showed no voltage at the elbow. Mr. Williams walked back to an open pull box at the end of the driveway and sat the tester down. Mr. Williams stated that Mi. Christy had opened the pull box and pulled out two elbows. The elbows were attached to a feed through bushing. Mi.. Williams and Mr. Christy were going to identify the cable in the pull box to see if it was the same as the bad cable in the transformer. Mr. Williams stated that Mr. Clvisty put on his 20,000 volt gloves and sleeves and was to test the elbows for voltage. At this time, Mi. Williams had gone to the truck and was working with the pulling tape. Mr. Williams stated that at the time of the incident he had his back to Mr. Clwisty and did not actually see the incident but he did hear the arc and when he turned to look he saw Mr. Christy fall to the ground. Mu. Williams dialed 91 1. Mr. Williams saw burns to both of Mr. Christy’s hands and stated that Mr. Christy was complaining that his left foot was injured. Louisville Metro EMS ai-rived on scene and transported Mr, Christy to University Hospital where lie was later admitted for overnight observation. According to Mi. Christy’s family, Mr. Christy had a possible entry wound to the right hand and a possible exit wound to the left foot. Mi. Christy also had burns to the left hand. Mi.. Christy was released the next day on July 2 1,20 1 1. MI+. Christy was interviewed by Keith McBride on July 22,201 1 at the Teani Fishel office. Mi.. Christy stated that when he and Mr. Williams arrived on the job site a job briefing was held before he and Mr. Williams got out of the truck. Mr. Williams was going to the transformer feeding 15500 Bridle Gate Drive to verify that the elbow had been stood off and Mi. Chisty was going to the pull box to remove the 2 PSC 11 of 285

--- Page 19 ---
lid. Once Mr. Christy reinoved the lid ftom the pull box Mr. Christy stated that Mr. Williams was already on his way back to the pull box. M. Christy stated that Mi.. Williams asked if he was going to test the elbows and Mr. Williams said “yes”. Mr. Christy stated that he placed the two elbows on the feed through bushing on the edge of the pull box and tested the voltage tester which appeared to be working. M. Christy stated that he removed the test point caps on the elbows and tested both elbows several times. No voltage was indicated on the tester. Mr, Christy stated that he thed removed his 20,000 volt gloves and sleeves. Mi.. Christy stated that Mr. Williams asked what the tag number was on one elbow. Mr. Christy stated that after reading the number Mr. Williams did not reply. Mr. Christy stated that he pulled a little on the cable to see if it could be pulled out. Mi. Christy stated that the cable appeared to be loose and he thought that the cable could be replaced easily. Mi.. Christy stated that Mi. Williams then went to the truck to get the pulling tape. Mi.. Williams was working with the pulling tape approximately 4 - 5 feet from the pull box with his back to Mr. Christy. Mr. Christy stated because he had read the elbow tag number to MI-. Williams and he did not reply, Mr. Christy assumed it was the correct cable and pulled the elbow/cable off of the feed through bushing that he assumed was to be replaced. The cable in the pull box had still not been identified at this tiine. MI-. Christy grabbed the right bushing/cable with his right hand and placed his left foot on the left cable and pulled thein apart. After pulling the elbow off, Ah. Christy touched the elbow to the eye bolt on the feed through bushing to discharge any static that inay have been on the cable. Mr, Christy received injuries to both hands and his left foot. Mr. Christy was released from the hospital the following morning and he is expected to make a fiill recovery. It was later discovered that the Chance voltage tester was not working correctly. The test button on the tester worked intermittently, ** There has been no utility construction on the URD system for the six months prior to this incident.

B-1 B PURI’OSE OF TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE GROUNDING I. Ir?troclirciioii Traditionally, most liiieiiieii and first-line supervisors believed that working between personal protective grounds 011 a de-energized line provided absolute safety. They believed that if the line was accidentally energized, all of the current would flow iiito the earth through tlie grounds, and none of the current would flow into tlie work area. This bclief is false. The objective of personal protective grounds iiitist be to liinit cui-reiit flowing tlxougli the lineman’s body to a safe value. Personal protective grounds must also limit any voltage rise on the de- energized line wliicli may occur due to inductive and capacitive coupling with nearby energized lines, A critical factor in applying personal protective grounds for protection of liiienieii is to absolutely control tlie niaxinium voltage stress across the work area. This control is best accomplished by installing persoiial protective grounds at the work site and in parallel with the workman. The current flow rate in a conductor is approximately 186,000 miles per secoiicl. Circuit protective devices simply caiiiiot operate in the time it takes for current to flow from grounding cables placed oiic span, or even one mile aliead of a pole or structure being worked on to tlie work site. * It is iiiiportaiit to understand that proper grouiiding acconiplislies two distinct objectives. The first objective is to verify that a circuit wliicli is nsstciiied to be dc- eiiergizccl is cctticdly de-energized. This is accomplished during tlie initial voltage testing and is verified by installing conductor grounds on tlie circuit. The second objective is to manage current flow in the work area, should the circuit inadvei-teiitly be re-energizccl. This is accoiiiplislied by thc conductor grounds providing an adequate cui-reiit path to grouncl for fault cments, which allows the circuit interrupting dcvice(s), fiises, reclosers, or breakers to operate and de- energize tlie circuit. Esfects of‘Ciii*seiit Tlvotigl? the Himimi Uocly a. The aniouiit of electrical cui-rent that the human body can withstancl depends on tlie magtiitudc aiid frequency of the current, and the duration of exposure (see examples listed below). b. For an adult male, 60 Hz AC: I. at 0.001 1 Amps . . . the worker feels a “tingle” . . . this is tlie PSC41 of285

“Percept ion Tlu-esho Id“ at 0.0090 Amps . . . A painful shock results at 0.0160 Amps . . . Muscle contraction prevents the worlter from releasing an energized conductor or the “Let-Go Tlueshold’y 11. B -2 IV. at 0.164 Amps . . . The rliytluiiic pumping action of the heart will cease, resulting in certain death if the condition is not quicItly coiyected. This is the “Fibrillation Threshold”. c. For an adult male (GO Hz AC), 0.5% probability of fibrillation occurs when exposed to 0.164 Amps for 30 cycles (apprax. 0.5 seconds). Thus, for longer durations of exposure, flie amount of current (Amps) that the huma11 body may witlistand is iiiucli lower. This enipliasized the iniportance of fast fault clearing. (1. The accepted iiiiniiiiuni value of resistance for a worker’s body is 500 Ohis. Although dry skin may have a resistance of5,OOO to 50,000 Chis, water or perspiration will reduce tliis considerably. In addition, voltages over 250 volts readily penetrate tlie skin’s resistance. c. It is also iiiiportaiit to realize that a wood pole is riot an insulator at high voltages, a wet pole can have a resistance as low as 2,000 Olms per linear foot. Siticc the neutral is often on an iiisulated spool, it is not necessarily electrically bonded to the pole. Additional measures may be iiceded, such as grounding clusters, to create an eauipoteiitial zone on the pole. Possible Sowces of Potenticd It is important to recognize all possible soiirces of voltage which present a hazard to the employee during conditions when tlie line is pesrmiecl to be de-energized. A line may become energized by any of tlie following: a. Electr.ostntic-coicyZed voltcge: A voltage is developed clue to capacitive- coupling of the isolated (ungrounded) line and an energized circuit. While designed to discharge within a few minutes after being de-energized, sliuiit capacitors on tlie line can produce thc same effect, b. ~lecfr.oirtngr~etic-co~~~lecl voltcrges: The energized line acts as the primary winding of a transformer, aticl the de-energized line acts as the secondary winding. 111 this way, crossing or parallel line can iiiduce a voltagc on one ano tlier . c. Bcrckjeed: External sources, such as customer-owned generators, can backfeed secondary current through the distribution transformer, energizing the primary conductor at the priiiiary voltage. Baclcfeed can exist even in short spans where all three phases of the primary are visibly open on both sides of tlie worlc location. Multiple transforiiicrs feeding the same secondary can produce the same effect. In addition, delta-connected transforiiiers not protected against a single-phasing condition can also backfeed priniary current to a phase presumed to be “clead”. d. DC voltcrge: A DC voltagc can be trapped on the line due to switching transients. Although tlie discharge current is very low, X may be startling to an unsuspecting worlter on tlie pole, perhaps rcsulting in 8 fall or recoil of an arm into an energized phase. PSC 42 of 285

Although proper switching procedures are dcsignecl to prevent such crrors, grounding is a prudent secondary line of de€ense. f, Extei*iicil foi-ces: Forces beyond tlie control of tlie line crccv, such as a car- pole accident, can cause an accidental contact with energized utility lines (foreign or OE) which cross over or tinder tlie lines being worlced upon.

Step Potei?ticiI: Step potciitial may be hazardous if a worker is near a ground rod (luring a fault. The potential gradient around a ground rod is non-linear wider fault conditions, and depends ripon a variety of factors, including the soil resistivity. However, as a rule of thumb, the potential approximately halves itself every 2.5 to 3 feet near the point of entry. That is, if the voltage at tlie ground rod is 7200 volts, theii the voltage 2.5 to 3 feet away should be about 3600 volts. IJiider faulting conditions, a hazardous current niay flow fiom a worlters foot, tluough tlic workers body, and exit tluough the opposite foot. b. Toiicli Pofeiificil: To~icli potential may be hazardous if a worker is in contact with equipment or a velGcle during a fault, as the workcr’s body may become a path for fault cui-rcnt. Under fault conditions, a hazardous current may flow fiom a worker’s hand, through the worker’s body, and exit tlirough one or both fcct. c. E-niisfir. Pofeiifinl: Transfer potential occurs when vehicles or equipiiiciit are at different potentials. The may be present if, one line truclc is bonded to one ground rod (wliicli is bonded to tlie de-energized line) aiid a second truck is bonded to another ground rod. If an eiiiployee contacts both velucles siiiiultaneousIy, directly or indirectly with a conductive object, an electrical shock niay result due to diffcrciices in ground resistances. Adclitional ineasures mnst be talccn to protect the gronnd worlcer from step, touch, and transfer potentials. These measures include grounding, bonding, insulation, and isolation. PSC 43 of 285

The following explain the procedures which must be followed to install pcrsonal junipers when the conductor grounds are NOT 011 tlie structure being worked (see Drawing #4). a. 1711en installing a persoiial juniper on iiiultiple circuit structures or otlier circuit coiifigurations which could be potentially confiisiiig, each coiiductor should be voltage tested as in # [8.] before the personal jumper is attached. b. The personal jmiiper is connected to tlie structure at a point just below tlie working level of the linenian’s lowest pole contact arid then to the grounded phase to be worked (cvliicli was grounded in # [9.]). On a woodeii structure this is accoinplished by using a wooden pole grounding cluster. If thc priniary neutral is available, install a lead, first to the neutral, aiicl then to tlie pole grounding cluster (or directly to a steel structure). Install a second lead (personal jnniper), first to tlie cluster, and then to the grounded yliasc to be worked. If a priiiiary neutral is not available, install a personal juniper first to PSC 50 of 285

--- Page 58 ---
the cluster and then to thc grouiidecl phase to be worked. If additioiial phases on the structure are to be worl&, the phase elid of tlie personal jumper must be discoiiiiected from the phase .where work has been completed and moved to tlie next phase to be worked before barehaiided contact with that phase is made. c. EiiibeckIed Bnse Steel Tower ciircl Poles are considered grouiided surfaces and do iiot require the structure grounding cluster. The personal juniper lead shall be attached to these stimhires at the point just below the workiiig Icvel of tlie lineinan's fect. A nut welded to a steel pole (into wliicli a threaded stud may be screwed) serves as tlie coiltiectioii point for tliis sittiation. Lattice steel towers require the use of a tower grounding claiiip in place of one of the conductor gro.ouiidiiig claiiips in the personal juniper assembly. Brciclcet Gruiiiidiiig Procediri-es: Follow tlie same steps as in the single point procedure oritliiied above [#I 13 but do iiot require tlie use of a personal protective jumper, A complete bracket ground coiifiguratioii would involve establishing a complete set of conductor grounds on both sides of tlie work area following basically the same procedures as outlined under single point grounding up to step ['I).]. Bracket grounds are generally to be placed as close to tlie work area as practical, Apply Conductor Gromids: Ground ALL de-energized codtictors on both sides of tlie work location as described below remembering that the sequence of events is as important as making the proper comicctions. The grounding condiictors sliorrld not touch any worker while tlie grounds are being connected to the line conductors. The facilities are iiot considered de-energized uiitiI all grounds have been applied. a. Wlieii tlie primary neutral is the conductor grouiid source: (see Drawing #5) I. IV. IV. Coiiiiect a ground lead to the primary neutral, then to the lowest or closest pliase conductor. Coiuiect another lead to the grounded phase and then to the next lowest or closest phase. Repeat [II.] until all phases are grounded. Redo step [a.] for opposite bracket ground location. b. When there is no primary neutral: (See drawing #5) Connect a grouncl lead to the growid source, then to tlie lowest or closest phase conductor.

Uiidesgsoiind JVoslrers: Underground systenis have iidierently greater hazards than overhead systems. Due to tlie liiiiited ability to visually verify circuit routes, there is a greater reliaiice on circuit maps. In addition, cable sheaths often develop iiiduced potentials due to close capacitive coupling with energized phase conductors. In underground vaults, manlioles, and in padmounted equipleiit, a significant flash hazard exists in the event of a fault at the work location. Because of this hazard, arc-suppression bIailItets sliall be used. Also, since the worker is in direct contact with tlie earth, step and touch potential hazards nearly always exist at tlie work location under fault conditions. Tciilgcde: BEFORE protective grounds are appIied or the CD~ZL~I~~IIC~III~II~ of any work.

URD AND THREE PI-TASE UNDERGR(PTJT\;TD GRQUNDING PROCEDURES The use of personal protectivc equipment (PPE) is required when opeiliiig pad-mounted transformers and switch-gears. This will consist of rubber gloves, sleeves, hard hat, safety glasses, and di-electric boots. The use of this personal protective equipment is also required while testing cables and equipment for potential voltage, installation, and renioval of grounds. When it is required to work on cable, you inust have the cable grounded on both sides of your work area at the nearcst open point. Neutral continuity mist be maintained when opening a cable or tlie neutral will be considered energized. Elech*ociition is possible if coiitiiiiiity is riot imiintoinecl, due to cli&*erices iri yotentid. Grounding of cable or equipment, will only be done afier it is verified that cable or equipment, is de-energized. ATOTE: Spilciiig the ccible will be the lost opiiori to veri& the ccrble is de-energized, Grounding of cable in a transformer will be done with tlie use of a statid-off-feecl-thru bushing, and grounding elbow. This application only applies to dead front transforniers. Grounding a live fiont transformer requires a ground jumper from a live front grounding kit. Grounding cable in a pad-mounted switch gear will require a Iive front grounding kit. Always renieiiiber to connect the juniper to the system neutral first, then, to the pliase grounding stud. Grounding pot heads will be done at tlie bottom of an open cut-out with a 2/0 ground jumper, by first coimecting the ground juniper to tlie system neutral, then connecting the jumnper to the cut- out grounding clamp. When the pothead lead is connected to an under arm disconnect, then connect thc juniper to the pothead lead. Checldng for voltage notentid: When checking live front equipment wearing Iiardhat, safety glasses, gloves, sleeves, and di- electric boots, check the primary connections with a voltage detector. Always check the voltage detector first, malting stire the voltage detector is working properly, preferably with a Itno~vn energized part aiicl test button. A phasing tester may also be used in this application by testing from ground to phase. PSC 58 of 285

1 URD AND THREE PHASE UNDERGROUND GROUNDING PROCEDURES On dead front transfomcrs: To check for voltage potential, iiistall the elbow on the stancl-off-feed-thrii bushing. Install the insulating plrrg 011 the open side of bushing, then go to tlie oilier end of the cable at the location to be opened. Install the elbow on the stand-off-feed-tlm bushing, with the phasing tester check fiom the neutral to the opcii bushing on the tratisfoiiiier. Verifjkg that your iiietcr is worlcing properly, iiiaititaiii contact with tlie nentral, plug the phasing meter into the open side of tlie feed- thu bushing, then, check for voltage potential. If there is no voltage detected, plug the meter back into tlie open bushing on the transfoiiiicr to verify that tlic meter is still working properly. This is the preferred method of determining a de-energized cable. PSC 59 of 285

Below you will find the preliminary findings of our investigation. On June 30,201 1 Jimmy Williams was assigned WR# 2842574 to repair a faulted URD cable between transformer 9841 0 and transformer 85782 on URD Circuit 3944 (Canterbrook Farms). Jimmy Williams and Mathew Christy arrived at the site and found that the cable between transformer 85782 and 9841 0 had been isolated and carded by LG&E personnel. Jimmy and Mathew began testing to determine if the cable in question was isolated. Once it was determined the cable was isolated, the crew connected fault locating equipment to the cable and located the fault which was located inside of transformer 85782. The crew determined the cable had been damaged near the bottom edge of the transformer from when a vehicle had struck the transformer at an earlier date. After an inspection of the area, the crew determined that a pull box located near the street at 15520 Bridalgate Drive, the same location as the transformer in question, may contain the damaged cable. A tag located on an elbow inside the pull box indicated the cable went to transformer 85782. On July 5, 201 1 this information was forwarded to Tyrone Grinstead of LG&E. On July 18, 201 1 , Tyrone requested that the crew attempt to With Offices In ATLANTA * CINCINNATI * COLUMBUS * DALLAS 0 DAYTON 0 HOUSTON 0 LOUISVILLE LAS VEGAS 0 LOS ANGELES NASHVILLE o ORLANDO - PHOENIX RICHMOND e SAN DIEGO 0 TAMPA 0 TUCSON *WASHINGTON DC www.teamfishel.com PSC 61 of 285

remove the damaged cable from transformer 85782 to the pull box located at 15520 Bridalgate Drive and replace it with new cable. On July 20,201 1 Jimmy and Matt returned to the job site to complete the repairs. Jimmy and Matt had a job brief that covered them through the act of physically and visually verifying the cables and then working to pull the cable that was suspected to run from the transformer to the pull box. The crew tested the cable for voltage at transformer 85782 and verified the cable was still isolated as they had left it on their previous trip to the jobsite. The A.B. Chance model Multi range voltage detector during our preliminary investigation has concluded that the tester was working just prior to and during the testing of the cables. This has been concluded by Jimmy Williams testing the unit at a known source at a transformer on location. As well as Matthew Christy testing it at least two occasions at the location of the incident. Further investigation into the reason for a reported false reading will be conducted Jimmy instructed Mathew to open the pull box at the site, and then remove the cables from the pull box. Once the cables were removed, Jimmy then said to test the cable. During this time, Jimmy was gathering the materials and tools to take to the transformer and set up to perform the physical and visual cable confirmation. At that point, Mathew had determined the cable was de-energized. Without direction from his supervisor, Mathew removed one elbow from the feed through stand-off without wearing the required PPE or confirming grounding of the cable. Mathew then proceeded to contact the elbow to the feed-through set screw faulting the cable that was running from transformer 85782 to transformer 8551 3 which was still energized, resulting in Mathew’s injuries. This led to a fault on the circuit blowing the fuse located at Routt Rd and Bridalgate Drive. PSC 62 of 285

Team Fishel, believes that all members of the team will work hard to maintain an excellent work and training record with high standards of conduct.

That means coming to work on time every scheduled workday, attending all scheduled events, keeping Team Fishel’s best interests a priority, and taking actions that will not harm the source of Team Fishel’s livelihood. b. If an instructor, or representative of Team Fishel speaks with an apprentice about a problem, he or she should listen carefully the first time. Team Fishel will work with an apprentice to overcome problems, with the supervisor often using progressive corrective action. However, if Team Fishel determines a serious violation has occurred, the apprentice may be immediately dismissed from the apprenticeship program, and be terminated from employment without having received any prior warnings. The corrective action will be determined by how the Apprenticeship Committee, and/or Team Fishel view the seriousness of the incident(s) and the surrounding circumstances. B. Related Instruction General Attendance Requirements a.

found that the pad mount transformer had been hit and knocked off of the pad and the cable feeding the transformer had been damaged / cut just off of the elbow inside of the transformer. The Trouble tech pulled this bad cable off of transformer 85782, placed an inforination card on the elbow and stood the cable off at transformer 9841 0, placing an inforination card there as well. This isolated the cable from transformer 984 10 that was feeding transformer The Trouble Tech then received permission to close in TLM 601287 at the lateral pole. The normal open was found to be in transforiiier 8608 1. The Trouble Tech closed in the normal open at transformer 8608 1 and restoring the remaining outages and iiioving the normal open to transformer 984 10.

While Team Fishel utilizes classifications to determine a Teammate’s skill level, Team Fishel may also utilize classifications to determine pay grades within the Teammate ranks. In the case of Jimmy Williams, Team Fishel recognizes Jimmy as a Crew Leader at the Journeyman level due to his experience in Underground Residential Distribution applications. Jimmy’s background includes seventeen years of experience with Louisville Gas & Electric in their URD Department with an additional seven years of experience with Team Fishel working on URD applications. Due to Jimmy’s lack of experience in Overhead applications required to make Journeyman status in pay grade, Team Fishel has determined that the Apprentice Three pay grade is commensurate with the skills Jimmy currently possesses.

of 1 oore, Jeffrey C (PSC) From: Moore, Jeffrey C (PSC) Sent: To: Keith McBride (keith.mcbride@eon-us.com) Cc: Subject: FishellChristy Keith, I am following-up on the Fishel incident and had some additional information I need from the company. During the field investigation Keith you showed me the A B Chance voltage detector that was used prior to the incident. We could not find a recent test date on the device and when the device control switch was moved it appeared the indicator on the KV scale might not be working properly. I need the following documentation. Thursday, September 08,201 1 158 PM Jim Dimas (jim.dimas@eon-us.com); Ken Sheridan (kensheridanaeon-us.com) Could you check with Fishel and have them send a document showing the required scheduled testing on the A B Chance voltage detector used that day. Documentation showing the last time it was tested? Documentation of any testing performed on this device after this incident.

I do not know why or understand why those numbers are on the elbow, looks like either a 9 or 6. Typically the numbers are associated with the transformer, It is possible that for future use that may have been what a new transformer number would have been. We do not number pull boxes though.

From: Moore, Jeffrey C (PSC) [mailto:JeffreyC.Moore@ky.gov] Sent: Friday, October 14,2011 8:48 AM To: McBride, Keith Cc: kbthompson@teamfishel.com Subject: URD numbering on cables Keith and Kenny, Keith I have a couple of question about the circuit numbering on the URD cables in the pull box (transformer pedestal) Mr. Christy was working at the time of the incident. The pictures taken that day at that pull box show an elbow terminator with the 85782, and the other terminator that was apparently damaged by the arc during the incident. What is the single number in the picture showing the damaged terminator? Also does LG&E use any indentifying markshumbers on the outside of a pull box? Kenny could you check with Mr. Williams and see if he and Mr. Christy had verified the numbers on the terminators In this pull box before the incident. If so what was the numbers on each terminator in the pull box?

It was in the information requested (1 Updated area print) and sent on 10/11/2011. Why was this print revised on 7/28/2011, and what was changed from the previous print? Based on the information below do you have the original print showing how this was fed from the pull box located on Bridal Gate Drive to transformer 847461 If so, please provide a copy with the information requested in this email. Wednesday, November 09,201 1 151 PM Thank You From: McBride, Keith [mailto:Keith.McBride@lge-ku.com] Sent: Friday, October 28, 2011 6:24 AM To: Moore, Jeffrey C (PSC) Subject: Elbow tagging numbers Importance: High Jeff, After more follow-up and a subsequent meeting with Safety and Technical Training and the URD Team Leader, we have determined what the number found on the elbow is and what that number was associated to. The number on the elbow is 84746. This number, as we discussed earlier, is associated to a transformer. The transformer is located at the end of Pasafino Court. At the time of construction, the cable coming out of transformer-84746, traveled to the pull box located on Bridle Gate and looped. Later in the development of the subdivision, two other transformers were installed in between the transformer-84746 and the pull box located on Bridle Gate. Being that the cable was located in a pull box, it is assumed that the transformer installation crews did not go to the pull box and change the number on the elbow.

You asked “Why was this print revised on 7/28/2011, and what was changed from the previous print?” Answer: Because of the incident itself and because the initial view on site was that the cable involved had been tied to a different cable, LG&E wanted to verify the whole URD system in that neighborhood. The only change to the revised print was showing how the cable actually went to the transformer and two elbow numbers on the print were revised to show other installed transformers. In addition, the print you requested is attached.
