5Civil Money Penalty (CMP) Funds Federal and State law dictate certain quality standards for NFs that are enforced through periodic surveys conducted by the Virginia Department of Health and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Several remedies exist to address quality issues raised during the survey process including imposition of civil money penalties for NF out of compliance. 6Civil Money Penalty (CMP) Funds CMS gives states broad latitude in using CMP funds. Nationally, states use CMP funds for: 1) survey and certification activities, such as temporary management, relocation, or consulting; and, 2) special projects. Notes : Annual unduplicated enrollment in the Virginia Medicaid program

7Civil Money Penalty (CMP) Funds CMP funds are collected when quality deficiencies are discovered during periodic on-site surveys. VDH conducts the on-site surveys and assesses the fines. The amount of a fine assessed depends upon three deficiency categories. 8Civil Money Penalty (CMP) Funds Category 1 Deficiency - typically remedied by a plan of correction, state monitoring, and/or directed in-service training. Category 2 Deficiency – resolution includes denial of payment by CMS for new admissions for all residents, and/or CMPs of $50 to $3,000 per day; or, a single instance of $1,000 to $10,000

9Civil Money Penalty (CMP) Funds Category 3 Deficiencies (most serious) Deficiencies in Category 3 directly affect resident behavior, nursing practices, quality of life, and quality of care. Remedies involve temporary management or termination of the provider agreement. 10Presentation Outline Background Civil Money Penalty (CMP) Funds QIP Advisory Committee Committee Discussions A Culture of Caring and Better Jobs Better Care The Strategic Plan Conclusion

13Committee Discussions QIP programs were researched in other states and considered for replication in Virginia Areas of committee discussions included: 1) health care worker shortage and high rates of turnover; 2) recruitment and retention of direct care staff; 3) consumer satisfaction; 4) clinical outcomes; 5) quality of life for residents. 14Committee Discussions Summary of Committee Discussions: For the foreseeable future, the need to attract and retain an adequate and stable number of well-qualified and motivated direct care workers will continue to be a shared concern of employers, employees, consumers, families, and public payors .

--- Page 7 ---
15Committee Discussions Quality Improvement Programs in other states were reviewed by the committee. Evaluation of programs focused primarily on 1) improving efficiency and quality of resident se rvices, and 2) ability to enhance nursing staff’s ability to perform their jobs with knowledge and respect. 16Committee Discussions Summary Based upon discussions and review of existing QIPs, the committee endorsed building on voluntary models that would refocus facility culture, operations, and outcomes without increasing costs.

19A Culture of Caring North Carolina’s Program, Better Jobs Better Care , a voluntary program builds a culture of caring within nursing facilities and is a proven model for quality care. Of all the programs reviewed, Better Jobs Better Care of North Carolina seemed to best match the committee’s vision for enhancing the lives of Virginia’s nursing facility residents. 20Better Jobs Better Care Better Jobs Better Care began as a pilot program limited to 60 providers. North Carolina expanded the successful pilot program statewide with the intent of making it a meaningful and voluntary “raise-the-bar” program pertaining to nurse recruitment and retention in long-term care.

25Presentation Outline Background Civil Money Penalty (CMP) Funds QIP Advisory Committee Committee Discussions A Culture of Caring/Better Jobs Better Care The Strategic Plan Conclusion 26The Strategic Plan The Mission The Virginia Quality Improvement Program Advisory Committee seeks to ensure an adequate supply of nursing staff in Virginia’s NFs through innovative recruitment and retention practices to meet the current and future need for care of one of the Commonwealth’s most vulnerable populations.

--- Page 13 ---
27The Strategic Plan Goal One Promote culture change in NFs by encouraging NFs to adopt proven operational practices and innovative strategies that strengthen the performance of nursing staff and improve the quality of care based on the “Better Jobs Better Care” demonstration project. 28The Strategic Plan Goal One, Objective One Improve the quality of Virginia’s NFs by examining the potential use of CMP funds to develop a voluntary incentive- driven program to promote “culture change.”

--- Page 14 ---
29The Strategic Plan Goal One, Objective Two Develop and maintain online resources offering technical assistance to NFs on nursing recruitment and retention efforts. Include information on staff career advancement, mentoring, and trends. 30The Strategic Plan Goal Two Using the “Better Jobs Better Care” model, direct a portion of CMP funds specifically towards recruitment and retention efforts of nursing staff in NFs, particularly of nursing assistants, that would provide positive inducements for NFs to voluntarily implement practices to improve workforce stability and care quality.

--- Page 15 ---
31The Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective One Develop, pilot, and implement a uniform set of criteria and expectations for statewide use, on a voluntary basis, for NFs that address factors affecting the recruitment, retention, and job satisfaction of direct care staff. Consideration should be given to the reason why nursing staff leave their jobs as demonstrated in long-term care research. 32The Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective Two Consider the “raise-the-bar” program pertaining to direct care staff recruitment and retention based on job practices known to contribute the high turnover and, by extension, workplace cultures where there is low turnover and high job satisfaction (supportive workplaces, balanced workloads, training, and career opportunities).

33The Strategic Plan Goal Two, Objective Three Outline eligibility requirements for participation as a pilot site and criteria for attaining a special designation indicating that the NF is a participating facility. The program should allow for creative, innovative, and cost-effective approaches to achievement of identified measurable objectives based on sound culture change principles. 34The Strategic Plan: Funding DMAS could use existing CMP funds to begin the development and implementation of the QIP project.

--- Page 17 ---
35The Strategic Plan: Funding The Advisory Committee may consider setting aside a base funding amount of $500,000 to offset co sts of relocation of residents, main tenance of ope ration of a NF pending correction of deficiencies or closure. 36The Strategic Plan: Funding Funding Suggestion While the Advisory Committee did not discuss the Pay-for-Performance (P4P) initiative, the QIP should be a complementary program. It may be appropriate to use a small portion of the CMP funds to “jump start”the P4P project. Funding could be continued on a yearly basis in an amount determined by the Advisory Committee.
