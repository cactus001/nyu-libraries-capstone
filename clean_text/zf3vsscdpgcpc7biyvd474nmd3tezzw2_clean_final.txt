American taxpayers are quite interested in knowing how banks have used the money that Treasury has invested under the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) and Community Development Capital Initiative (CDCI). To answer that question, Treasury is seeking responses that describe generally how the CPP/CDCI investment has affected the operation of your business. We understand that once received, the cash associated with TARP funding is indistinguishable from other cash sources, unless the funds were segregated, and therefore it may not be feasible to identify precisely how the CPP/CDCI investment was deployed or how many CPP/CDCI dollars were allocated to each use. Nevertheless, we ask you to provide as much information as you can about how you have used the capital Treasury has provided, and how your uses of that capital have changed over time. Treasury will be pairing this survey with a summary of certain balance sheet and other financial data from your institution's regulatory filings, so to the extent you find it helpful to do so, please feel free to refer to your institution's quarterly ca ll reports to illustrate your answers. This is your opportunity to speak to the taxpayers in your own words, which will be posted on our website. What specific ways did your institution utilize CPP/CDCI capital? Check all that apply and elaborate as appropriate, especiall y if the uses have shifted over time. Your responses should reflect actions taken over the past year (or for the portion of the yea r in which CPP/CDCI funds were outstanding). Increase lending or reduce lending less than otherwise would have occurred. To the extent the funds supported increased lending, please describe the major type of loans, if possible (residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, small business loans, etc.). Increase securities purchased (ABS, MBS, etc.).

Without the infusion of capital, we would have restricted deposit accumulation in order to maintain capital levels. This has permitted us to maintain staffing levels at the prior year's level.

According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a valid OMB control number.

The time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 80 hours per response.We had earmarked these funds as a long term investment that would be used to support the growth of our mortgage loan portfolio. We have observed mortgage loan growth of 43% over the past year and 77 % over the past two years. DC Federal Credit Union has been successful in enhancing its capital strength and serving our communities by making credit available to 11,000. The productive use of CDCI funds is one of the tools that we have found helpful for our accomplishments o f these objectives.
