Each State must have a State Performance Plan (SPP) to evaluate the State's efforts to meet the requirements and purposes of the implementation of IDEA. The SPP is a six-year plan which describes New York State's performance on 20 indicators. States must report annually to the public on the performance of the State in an Annual Performance Report (APR) and each school district against the State's targets.
