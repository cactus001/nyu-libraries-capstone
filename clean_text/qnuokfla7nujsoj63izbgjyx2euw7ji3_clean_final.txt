114 Group II COHERENT INSTABILITIES IN THE 20 TeV RING*) - E.D. Courant Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY and State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY, USA. C. Pellegrini Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA ABSTRACT We discuss some of the limits on the average and peak current in the 20 TeV ring, produced by coherent .instabilities. We also discuss some effects of synchrotron radiation. INTRODUCTION We investigate the limitations on the performance of the 20 TeV proton ring due to co­ herent instabilities. This investigation uses a simple model l ) to describe the stability 1imits, based on the asstunption that all low frequency instabilities, w< c/d, where d is the vacUlUn tank dimension, can be cured by feedback. To stabilize high frequency effects one has to rely on Landau damping. We discuss the limitations on the beam intensity and beam configuration obtained from this model. We also discuss some of the effects introduced by synchrotron radiation. STABILITY CRITERIA As discussed in Ref. (1) we use two stability conditions, one for longitudinal effects, the microwave instability, and the other for transverse effects. They can be written as (1) eIZT R P eff (2) --'Zr"7f-v'E""--- ~ /).v where lill/E is the beam energy spread, I is the peak current in a btmch, a. is the momentum p compaction factor, E is the beam energy, e is the electron charge, v the betatron frequency, R the machine radius, /).V the betatron frequency spread providing Landau damping, (Z/n)eff is the longitudinal coupling impedance of the btmch to the surrotmding environment and (3)

Since a. ::: 1/v2 there is only a weak dependence on v and we will only evaluate (10), (11) for the case of the 'weak focusing ring". We use the following values:

We obtain: Fi =0.08 at E=1 TeV (12) and F* = 4 X 10-3 at E = 20 TeV • (13)B. Equations (10), (11) become (14) The small values of Fi mean that we are mainly limited by the longitudinal instability. In fact for a coasting beam at 1 TeV and for the assumed e1\ the energy spread is very small lillIE ::: 2.6 x 10-5 • For FB = Fi = 0.08 the energy spread is increased to 3.3 x 10-~ • For a total circulating current of 0.84 A we have from (14) that the effective longitu­ dinal coupling impedance must satisfy the condition ( ~) $3.5Q. (IS) neff This condition need only be satisfied in the frequency range w ~ cld where feedback cannot be used. .An impedance of the order of a few ohm has been obtained in the electron-positron storage ring, PETRA. SYNQIROTRON RADIATION EFFECTS The synchrotron radiation energy loss per turn U0, can be obtained from2 ) (16) where p is the bending radius, ro the classical proton radius and mc2 the proton rest energy.

The energy spread is smaller than the value detennined by the longitudinal emittance 8II , which is 2.6 x 10-5 for a coasting beam and 6.5 x 10-3 fOT a beam with a btmching factor F=4 x 10-:3 and at 20 TeV. Hence, according to our present tmderstanding of the microwaveB instability, as soon as the energy spread starts to decrease the btmch should become tmStable and the energy spread should remain at the value corresponding to the threshold of the in­ stability. The radial betatron emittance as determined by radiation alone is given by2) E = TIy 2R (aE)2 = 5.2 x 10-8 m rad x v3 E and is again much smaller than the emittance at injection, E tV 2TI x 10-5 m rad. The reduc­x tion in transverse emittance produced by radiation might become important in a p-p configura­ tion, where the reduction in beam transverse size would increase the beam-beam ttme shift, !:lv, and the ltuninosity by a factor equal to the emittance ratio or about 1200. Again we ex­ pect that the beam-beam interaction will start to blow up the beams long before such a large increase is reached. However we can assume that the p-p system will adjust itself to the optimum value of !:lv. Also the radiation damping might be helpful in cOtmteracting slow diffusion processes. s. CONCLUSIONS The results obtained in Section 3 show that coherent instabilities should not prevent us from reaching the design intensity of 1015 circulating protons. However to reach this goal one will have to use feedback to control the low frequency instabilities and to reduce the longitudinal coupling impedance to a few ohm. Also when these conditions are satisfied one requires a very small blll1ching factor to avoid a blow up of the longitudinal phase space. Of course, a much more detailed analysis will be needed when the ring is designed.
