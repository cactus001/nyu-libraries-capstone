APHIS works to safeguard American agricul- ture by keeping destructive foreign pests anddiseases out of the United States. Should anexotic disease threaten U.S. borders, it’sAPHIS’ role to combat the threat and pre-vent an outbreak. By ensuring the health andwell-being of animals and plants nationwide,APHIS helps improve agricultural productiv-ity and competitiveness and contributes tothe national economy and the public health. APHIS’ dedicated workforce strives to meet the needs of an ever-expanding customerbase. We use state-of-the-art technology tokeep up with trends in agriculture and inter-national trade as well as other pertinentissues. All of our work enhances the UnitedStates’ ability to buy and sell agriculturalproducts in the international marketplace,fortiﬁes our abundant, safe, and diverse foodsupply, and contributes to the health of U.S.public and private lands.Global Trade Agreements Several global trade agreements help APHIS to carry out its mission, the mostimportant of which are the North AmericanFree Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and theWorld Trade Organization (WTO) Sanitaryand Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement, the suc-cessor to the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT). Both have helped theUnited States become more competitive inthe international trade arena, especially inthe area of agriculture. This growing interest in agricultural trade has created a more visible role for APHIS andexpanded our mission to ensure that newtrade opportunities beneﬁt the United Stateswithout creating new threats from harmfulexotic pests and diseases. APHIS is delegatedas the primary negotiator for SPS-relatedtrade issues. In that role, APHIS has theresponsibility for regulating the importationof food and agricultural commodities intothe United States as well as establishing SPSrequirements that set the boundaries for safeinternational agricultural trade. The need forsuch SPS requirements is fully recognized byNAFTA and the WTO. NAFTA, a trilateral trade pact between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, went intoeffect in January 1994. The GATT was estab-lished in the wake of World War II, and itssuccessor organization, the WTO, was cre-ated in 1995 after a series of trade negotia-tions known as the Uruguay Round.Collectively, the WTO’s more than 140 mem-ber countries account for more than 90 per-cent of world trade. Decisions are madebased on the consensus of the entire WTOmembership. During NAFTA and WTO negotiations, coun- tries embarked on a historic effort to reformagricultural trade. Under both agreements,countries are required to base their SPSmeasures on scientiﬁc evidence. In short,countries are now required to scientiﬁcallyjustify their reasons for impeding the free 2APHIS in the Global Trade ArenaProtecting American agriculture is the basic charge of the U.S. Department ofAgriculture’s (USDA) Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service (APHIS).APHIS has employees stationed acrossthe country and around the world toaccomplish this mission.

ﬂow of trade. With the reductions in quotas and tariffs that are a result of WTO andNAFTA, there is a greater potential for coun-tries to use pests and diseases as artiﬁcialbarriers to trade. In order to exclude agricul-tural products presented for importation, acountry must be able to scientiﬁcally docu-ment that allowing such importation wouldcreate an unacceptable risk of introducingforeign pests or disease. To be designated asquarantine signiﬁcant, a pest or disease mustnot exist in the importing country or bepresent only in a limited area that is underofﬁcial control. NAFTA and WTO requirements for risk assessments are intended to make countries’SPS regulations more transparent and scien-tiﬁcally based. Countries also are required tobe consistent in their risk management prac-tices. Agricultural ofﬁcials cannot treat onecountry different from another when theimportation of their goods would result inthe same pest risk. It is important to note,however, that NAFTA and WTO clearly recog-nize the rights of countries to set their ownlevels of protection. Regionalization In addition, the WTO and NAFTA commitcountries to recognizing disease- and pest-free areas within a country even if a particu- lar pest or disease exists elsewhere in thenation. This concept is perhaps the most sig-niﬁcant policy and regulatory issue facingAPHIS and our trade partners. It has, how-ever, created new opportunities for theUnited States, as well as other countries thatmay have a pest in one region but be free ofit elsewhere. The concept of regionalization is founded on the longstanding idea that import require-ments should be based on geography and sci-ence rather than on politics. The politicalborders between countries and delimitingstates within a country are invisible; geo-graphic boundaries, such as mountains andrivers, are not. Pests and diseases must be able to travel in order to spread. If the path isblocked by a mountain range down the mid-dle of a country, then the disease is naturallyconﬁned to one side of that country. The states of Sonora and Yucatan in Mexico are prime examples. While other regions in Mexico still have outbreaks of classicalswine fever (CSF), the prevalence of thedisease in Sonora and Yucatan is low. Basedon the principle of regionalization and a riskanalysis, the United States accepts imports offresh (chilled or frozen) pork from Sonoraand Yucatan even though other regions ofthe country are not allowed to export pork to the United States because of the presenceof CSF . Plant health ofﬁcials refer to regionalization as “area freedom.” The name is different, butthe results are the same. When Pennsylvaniaofﬁcials discovered an outbreak of plum poxin October 1999, area freedom kept theentire State, and perhaps the entire Nation,from being quarantined. Under area free-dom, the disease, which infects stone fruit,resulted in a quarantine only in the AdamsCounty, PA, area where plum pox wasdetected. Other major U.S. stonefruit-producing areas, such as Washington, cancontinue to export peaches, apricots, plums,and almonds. Should one nation disagree with another’s trade requirements, the requirements can bechallenged through NAFTA and the WTO’sdispute settlement processes. A disagree-ment arising between Mexico, Canada, or the United States could be ﬁrst addressedthrough NAFTA. In both NAFTA and theWTO, a panel is appointed to review the situ-ation and make a ruling. If a country fails torecognize the panel’s ruling, the WTOprovides a mechanism for proceeding.

International Standards The WTO and NAFTA encourage countries to base their SPS regulations on internationalstandards. Countries are required to publishproposed regulations in order to give othernations a chance to comment before theregulations go into effect. This process isintended to reduce unnecessary variancebetween countries’ technical health stan-dards—differences that are often the causeof trade disputes. It is a top priority of APHISto work with our trading partners to developinternationally acceptable standards. We’vealready made great progress in this area withsome nations, especially Canada and Mexico. APHIS works with and recognizes a number of standards-setting organizations that helpdetermine the rules for international trade. L’Ofﬁce International des Epizooties (OIE) and Animal Health One of the most important standards-setting organizations, Paris-based OIE has morethan 150 member countries. It was started inthe 1920’s in response to the appearance ofrinderpest in Europe from Pakistan. Eachmember country has one vote and one dele-gate. Its major functions are to collect anddisseminate information on the distributionand control of animal diseases, coordinateresearch on contagious animal diseases, andstandardize rules for international trade inanimals and animal products. OIE aims to ensure that scientiﬁcally justi- ﬁed measures are used to govern interna-tional trade in animals and animal products.The WTO has designated the OIE as theinternational forum for setting animalhealth standards, reporting global animalhealth situations and status, and presentingguidelines and recommendations on animalhealth issues.International and North American Organizations for Plant Health The WTO recognizes the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) when it comesto setting plant health standards. In effectsince 1952, the IPPC is a multilateral treatythat promotes “. . . common and effectiveaction to prevent the spread and introduc-tion of pests of plants and plant products and to promote measures for their control.”The treaty is administered by the Food andAgriculture Organization (FAO) of the UnitedNations. Currently, more than 100 countriesadhere to the IPPC. In 1989, an IPPC Secretariat was created to coordinate activities for the IPPC and to sup-port the development and administration ofinternational phytosanitary standards. Giventhe importance of international standards tofuture agricultural trade, the technical andregulatory nature of plant health issuescovered by the IPPC, and APHIS’ scientiﬁcexpertise in this area, APHIS has assumedthe role of lead U.S. agency participating inactivities of the IPPC. The IPPC objectives are to develop interna- tional plant health standards, promote theharmonization of plant quarantine activitieswith emerging standards, facilitate the dis-semination of phytosanitary information,support plant health assistance to developingcountries, and resolve disputes. The North American Plant Protection Organization (NAPPO)—a regional plantprotection organization of the IPPC createdin 1976—coordinates the efforts amongCanada, the United States, and Mexico toprotect their plant resources from the entry,establishment, and spread of plant pestswhile ensuring the free ﬂow of trade betweenthe three nations. APHIS employees are fre-quently assigned to NAPPO committeescharged with reviewing technical standardsor reviewing new methods for pest control. 4APHIS in the Global Trade ArenaIt is a top priority of APHIS to workwith our tradingpartners to developinternationallyacceptablestandards. We’vealready made great progress in this area withsome nations,especially Canadaand Mexico.

For example, APHIS employees worked with NAPPO to develop guidelines for the releaseof nonnative organisms to control weeds. In addition to establishing plant quarantine standards, NAPPO also has developed a pestrisk analysis (PRA) standard. PRAs are gener-ally done for every agricultural commodityentering the United States. The PRA identi-ﬁes foreign pests that could harm U.S. agri-culture and the level of risk related to aparticular commodity. By adhering to thePRA standard developed by NAPPO, theUnited States, Mexico, and Canada can all beassured they’re using the same approach toevaluate pest risks. Codex and Free Trade Areas for the Americas The Codex Alimentarius Commission for food safety standards is the third interna-tional standards-setting organization recog-nized by the WTO. Jointly managed by theWorld Health Organization and the FAO,Codex, established in 1963, facilitates worldfood trade by establishing international stan-dards based on accepted scientiﬁc knowl-edge. Codex deals with subjects such as foodadditives, pesticide residues, and food label-ing. Codex expert committees are composedof representatives from government regula-tory agencies, such as USDA’s Food Safetyand Inspection Service, the international sci-entiﬁc community, and industry. The OIE, IPPC, NAPPO, and Codex have earned prominent roles in determining thesubstance, direction, priorities, and out-comes of SPS requirements. Domesticgroups have grown increasingly aware ofthese organizations and the importance oftheir activities, resulting in increased inter-est and expectations concerning the develop-ment, establishment, and amendment ofinternational standards, particularly fromthe standpoint of dispute resolution.In addition to working with such standards- setting organizations as the OIE, IPPC, andCodex, the United States is also involved inthe proposed negotiation of Free Trade Areasfor the Americas (FTAA). In January 1995,the United States and 33 governments fromCentral and South America and theCaribbean established the foundation for theFTAA, making a joint declaration of theircommitment to the hemispheric integrationof economics and trade by 2005. FTAA hasthe potential of accelerating greater intra-hemispheric trade, particularly in agricul-ture, given the signiﬁcant role thatagriculture plays in the economies of mostLatin American and Caribbean countries.The FTAA initiative reﬂects current U.S.trade policy aimed at deepening our traderelations with newly emerging or developingeconomies of our hemisphere. As a result of WTO and the pending FTAA, Latin America has evolved into an importantregion in terms of new markets for U.S.agricultural goods. APHIS has played aninstrumental role in establishing traderelationships with these countries. APHIS in the Global Trade Arena 5

Asia–Paciﬁc Economic Cooperation Another example of U.S. efforts to broaden commercial relations beyond Europe andCanada is APHIS’ participation in the Asia–Paciﬁc Economic Cooperation (APEC). APECwas established in 1989 to promote coopera-tion in trade and other economic issues.What started out as an organization with12 member countries has nearly doubled insize to encompass countries as diverse asAustralia, Brunei, and China. As a member ofAPEC, the United States attends regularmeetings to discuss such issues as trade lib-eralization, technology transfer, investment,energy, and other topics of mutual interest.It was not until 1995, however, that APECmembers agreed to address agriculturaltrade. At this time, a group of agriculturaltechnical experts was formed to discussissues, including biotechnology and quaran-tine and pest management. APHIS recognizes the countries in the Paciﬁc Rim region as strategically importantagricultural markets and plays a key role inmeetings of the APEC agricultural technicalexperts. In recent years, APHIS has workedhard to develop technical working relation-ships with such nations as Japan, SouthKorea, and China. These relationships havebeen instrumental in creating new marketsfor U.S. agricultural commodities. APHISwas successful in March 2000 with helpingto open up the Chinese market to U.S. citrus.Besides being economically signiﬁcant, thisagreement also helps pave the way for futuremarket opportunities.Without the creation of the WTO and NAFTA, such trade relationships would notbe possible. It’s a principal role of APHIS tomake sure the United States and our tradingpartners adhere to the SPS rules set forth bythe WTO and NAFTA as well as the otherrelevant standards-setting organizations.While trade agreements have helped to openup new markets for the United States andother countries, APHIS must ensure thatU.S. agriculture is protected in all endeavorsand that agricultural imports from foreigncountries do not create new pathways forpests. APHIS’ role in the global marketplacewill continue to increase as the United States expands current trade relationships and establishes new partnerships withdeveloping countries.
