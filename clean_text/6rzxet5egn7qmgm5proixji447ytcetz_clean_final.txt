Q4. p. 15 Section 3.1 states “All services provided mu st be authorized on an ISP.” Will the services be only for the mother or also for the infant?

Is the vendor fiscally responsible for routine and emergency medi cal care? R6. No. Q7. p. 16 Section 3.3 B states that vendors must “provi de basic living skills training a minimum of 1 hour daily.” Can these ski lls be taught by the foster parent? Does the infant have to be in child care d uring the training or can the infant be present in the home and even included as part of the training (i.e. how to manage household tasks while giving proper s upervision to an infant) R7. Yes to both. Q8. p. 17 Section 3.3 D states that the vendor needs to “ensure the child’s involvement in at least one extra-curricular activi ty.” Who is responsible for the cost of child care during that time since it is not an activity listed under Section 3.3 K? R8. See R4. Q9. p. 17 Section 3.3 H states that the vendor must “ma ke at least monthly contact with the youth’s therapist.” Is it possibl e that the youth could be seen by one of the vendor’s staff therapists? R9. An ISP team decision. Q10. p. 17 and elsewhere in the RFP it refers to “All se rvices billed as Medicaid Rehab services must be in compliance with Chapter 1 05 of the Medicaid Rehab Manual and are not to exceed the daily caps.

If the foster parent provide s child care for the infant can he/she be reimbursed, in addition to the per di em, for that responsibility? R12. If the foster parent is providing the daycare then it is considered internal staff. If an outside Vendor has to be paid the 75% would be the responsibility of DHR. Q13. p.20 Section 4.2.5.2. If the vendor experienced no audit findings from its auditors the past 3 audits is it satisfactory to DH R to submit the audit letter that basically just states that the audit was condu cted according to generally accepted auditing standards and that the financial statements present the financial position of the vendor fairly in all mate rial respects? R13. Yes. Q14. p. 21 Section 4.2.5.3.5 states that, as part of the discharge policy, the vendor is “to include provisions of “step down” to a less restrictive environment.” If the mother is placed in foster care, is there the e xpectation that the mother will be moved to Independent Living or similar arra ngement and would that be the responsibility of the vendor? R14. An ISP team makes the decision where the child will move and when it is not the responsibility of the Vendor. Q15.

If we must specify the count ies does it mean we are unable to accept placement of the child not loc ated in those counties? R15. Vendors may specify “statewide” slots and no n eed to specify all 67 counties. Q16. Basic Residential Services #2009-100-12: 4.2.5.4.3, TLP #2009-100-11: 2.5.4.3; Mothers and Infants #2009-100-10: 4.2.5. 4.3: & Moderate #2009- 100-08: 4.2.5.4.3 – “Vendor must comply with all he terms and conditions of…..Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, the Am ericans with Disabilities Act, etc.” – What if we are “in process” with compliance with th e Rehabilitation Act of 1973?
