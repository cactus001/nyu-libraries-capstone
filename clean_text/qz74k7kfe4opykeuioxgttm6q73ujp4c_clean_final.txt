2 Published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Ocean Service Office of Coast Survey www.NauticalCharts.NOAA.gov 888- 990-NOAA What are Nautical Charts? Nautical charts are a f undamental tool of marine navigation. They show water depths, obstructions, buoys, other aids to navigation, and much more. The information is shown in a way that promotes safe and efficient navigation. Chart carriage is mandatory on the commercial ships that carry America’s commerce. They are also used on every Navy and Coast Guard ship, fishing and passenger vessels, and are widely carried by recreational boaters. What is a Booklet Chart? This BookletChart is made to help recreational boaters locate themselves on the water. It has been reduced in scale for convenience, but otherwise contains all the information of the full -scale nautical chart. The bar scales have also been reduced, and are accurate when used to measure distances in this BookletCha rt. See the Note at the bottom of page 5 for the reduction in scale applied to this chart. Whenever possible, use the official, full scale NOAA nautical chart for navigation. Nautical chart sales agents are listed on the Internet at http://www.NauticalCharts.NOAA.gov . This BookletChart does NOT fulfill chart carriage requirements for regulated commercial vessels under Titles 33 and 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Notice to Mariners Correctio n Status This BookletChart has been updated for chart corrections published in the U.S. Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency Weekly Notice to Mariners, and, where applicable, the Canadian Coast Guard Notice to Mariners. Additional chart corrections have been made by NOAA in advance of their publication in a Notice to Mariners. The last Notices to Mariners applied to this chart are listed in the Note at the bottom of page 7. Coast Pilot excerpts are not being corrected. For latest Coast Pilot excerpt visit the Office of Coast Survey website at http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/nsd/searchbychart.php?chart=160 (Selected Exc erpts from Coast Pilot) Griffin Point (70°03.6'N., 142°52.4'W.) is a low sandspit that projects out from the mainland. A mile WNW of the point is Oruktalik Entrance , a narrow barrier passage through which a depth of about 5 feet can be taken into Oruktalik Lagoon. The barrier islands off Griffin Point continue SE for 3 miles; thence to Pokok Bay are 25 - to 30 -foot bluffs fronted by narrow, steep sand beach except for the last 1.5 miles. Small boats can navigate very close to the beach between Griffin Point a nd Pokok Bay. Pokok Bay , 17 miles SE of Martin Point, is about 1 mile across. Bars extend out from both sides of the entrance. Depths are about 7 feet in the entrance and 10 to 12 feet in the bay proper. The entrance should be approached from the W, but ca re must be taken to stay off the sandbar that makes out from the NW side. The bay has good holding bottom and good protection from ice and winds. Tundra -covered Humphrey Point (69°58.3'N., 142°30.9'W.), on the SE side of Pokok Bay, has a low bluff and a na rrow sand beach. SE of Siku Point are low barrier islands that cover in many places at high water. The seaward sides of the islands are irregular, and small boats must stay well offshore. Angun Lagoon , behind the barrier reef between Humphrey Point and Angun Point , 4 miles to the SE has depths of 10 to 11 feet. There is a 10-foot bluff at Angun Point. The lagoon entrance, 1 mile NW of Angun Point, is 75 to 100 yards wide and has a controlling depth of 8 feet. The barrier islands are subject to change; entra nce must be made with caution. Beaufort Lagoon , with depths of 5 to 12 feet in the middle, extends about 14 miles SE behind the barrier reef from Angun Point to Siku Point. The SE part of the lagoon from the delta of Aichilik River to Siku Point has not be en surveyed but the entrances are known to be very shallow and subject to change. The principal entrance to the lagoon is a narrow channel with a depth of 2 to 5 feet about 1.8 miles SE of Angun Point; caution is advised. Nuvagapak Lagoon , with depths of 8 to 10 feet in the middle, is S of Beaufort Lagoon and extends SE to the delta of Aichilik River from Nuvagapak Point, a high tundra 1 mile back of the reef and 3.5 miles SE of Angun Point. Egaksrak Lagoon , S of Beaufort Lagoon between the delta of Aichili k River and Siku Point, has not been surveyed.
