DEPA RTMENT OF COMMERCE Patent and Tradema rk Office 37 C FR Part 1 [Docket No.: 2005–P–067] RIN 0651–AB94 Changes to Pract ice for the Exami nation of Claims in Patent Applications COMMENTS SUBMITTED BY JOH N JAMES MCGLEW The USPTO is responding to the appar ent difficulty in providing qua lity examination at the ra te applica tions are be ing filed. The solution proposed attempts to limit claims examined. Refer ence is made to the g rouping of cla ims by the B oard of Appea ls. Howeve r, such g rouping is not the same as what is being proposed. The proposal is limiting the claims considered. This is arbitrar y and does not ha ve any relationship t o the nee ds of the par ticular situation, namely the require ments as to the invention prese nted. The USPTO has a n effective sy stem at prese nt, namely char ging for cla ims in ex cess of twenty or charging for independent claims in excess of three. This presents a relationship between cost and the extra exami nation work. The idea that this system is to be discarded is unsettling a s it indi cates that the USPTO does not car e about the f ees a nd simply wants to lower the workloa d. This appea rs to be shortsig hted and to be c learly the wrong approa ch. The USPTO should at least maintain the tra dition of ex amining twe nty claims including three independe nt claims. This claim number is believe d to come fr om what has be en traditionally neede d for most ca ses, to eff ectively prese nt the application for examination. W here more c laims are ne eded, the applicant should pay . Howeve r, cla ims should not be ig nored. The filing f ee should be set to cover the costs. I f the ba cklog is increa sing a nd costs are rising, the fee can r eflect this and the appr opriate e fforts should be made for building up the Examining Corps. The fe e for extra claims should be linked to the extra costs. Instead of focusing on building up the Examining Corps the proposed changes essentially seek to limit the depth and extent of prosec ution and examination. R esourc es should be dire cted toward e xamination. A g ood Ex amining Corps is a na tional resourc e. If the ne w applica tion backlog is gr owing , the USPTO has fa ced this problem be fore. The tra ditional approac h of growing the USPTO and building up the Examining Corps pr ovides more c ertainty than ra tioning examination. It could be said that be sides the g rowing backlog of ca ses, there is another linked problem, namely political pressure focused on numbers rather than quality of exami nation. This is particular ly a proble m with there be ing no link betwe en re venue f rom fee s and the funds available to maintain the Ex amining Corps. The real thing that nee ds to be cha nged is to hire and train more Examiners and to m ake the USP TO a place where technically trained people want to work. Examiners must feel that ther e is a sig nificant purpose to what they do and be r ewarded financ ially and by a sense of job well ac complished. The stag gering rate at which Examiners have le ft in rec ent y ears points to not only a proble m of pay but also a problem of work

environment. The rules should not be changed as proposed. The USP TO proposal is too drastic with the re sult unknown. The USPTO needs to be pa tient. New tec hnologie s should sti ll have a significant positive impact on costs and efficiency, as new systems b ecome more familiar. With electronic filing now more use r friendly , there will be time saving s for the U SPTO and the applicants. F oreig n office searches c an neve r be g iven full faith and c redit (be cause of law differ ences and cla im differe nces) . Howeve r, systems that present the U S examiner w ith all prior art considered in r elated ma tters will have a positive effe ct as to ef ficienc y. Shrinking a nd stabiliz ing the backlog is possibl e. More resour ces should be dir ected now towar d the Examining Corps. John J ames McG lew Registered Patent Attorne y McGlew and Tuttle, P.C.
