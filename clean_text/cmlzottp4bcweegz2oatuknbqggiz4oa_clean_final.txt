Quigley Honors Holocaust Remembrance Day Thursday, 19 April 2012 11:49 WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Representative Mike Quigley (IL-05) honored Holocaust Remembrance Day, which began at sundown yesterday and continues until sundown this evening. “During this Holocaust Remembrance Day, we must never forget what happened during one of the darkest chapters of history,” said Rep. Quigley. “The memory does not dissipate with time, not for me, and certainly not for the hundreds of thousands who suffered and lost loved ones during the Holocaust. It is a solemn reminder of the history Jewish people carry each day and why our commitment to the state of Israel is so important.” During a trip to Poland in January , Rep. Quigley, along with Senator Mark Kirk (IL), visited the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum in Poland, where he laid a wreath in front of the execution wall. PHOTO : Rep. Quigley (r) and Sen.
