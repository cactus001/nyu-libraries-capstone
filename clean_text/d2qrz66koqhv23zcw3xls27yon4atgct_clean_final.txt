ITS Handbook (ITS-HBK-2810.02-01) ­ Security Assessment and Authorization ­ 1	� Introduction and Background 1	­ NASA requirements for protecting the security of NASA information and information systems are derived from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance. Information System Owners (ISOs) and other personnel responsible for the protection of NASA information or information systems shall follow NIST guidance in the proper security categorization ( Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199, Standards for Security Categorization for Federal Information and Information Systems ), and in the selection and implementation of information security controls ( FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems and NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations), in a manner consistent with the Risk Management Framework ( NIST SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems ). 2	­ This handbook augments NIST guidance by providing NASA-specific requirements, procedures and recommendations, where applicable. NASA-specific guidance does not negate NIST guidance, unless explicitly stated. 3	­ NASA Policy Directive (NPD) 2810.1, NASA Information Security Policy , NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 1, Security of Information Technology , and the collection of 2810 Information Technology Handbooks (ITS - HBK) satisfy the policy and procedure controls of NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations . 4	­ NPR 2810.1, Security of Information Technology, designates this handbook as a guide of NASA’s Security Assessment and Authorization (CA) information security controls. 5	­ The terms “shall” and “may” within this handbook are used as defined in ITS-HBK-0001, Format and Procedures for IT Security Policies and Handbooks. 6	­ The Security Assessment and Authorization control family relates to the activities and requirements surrounding the routine testing of security controls, the continuous monitoring of system security posture, and the ongoing risk-based decisions to approve or deny the use of a system. Officials within the NASA community are responsible for continuously ensuring the effectiveness of security control implementations throughout the life cycle of a system. Moreover, in light of an ever-changing security landscape, designated NASA officials should always be prepared to determine the impact of a system’s operation on the success of the NASA mission. 7	­ Applicable Documents • NPD 2810.1, NASA Information Security Policy • NPR 2810.1, Security of Information Technology • ITS-HBK-0001, Format and Procedures for IT Security Policies and Handbooks • ITS-HBK-2810.02-02, Security Assessment and Authorization: FIPS 199 Moderate & High Systems • ITS-HBK-2810.02-03, Security Assessment and Authorization: FIPS 199 Low Systems • ITS-HBK-2810.02-04, Security Assessment and Authorization: Continuous Monitoring – Annual Security Control � Assessments � • ITS-HBK-2810.02-05, Security Assessment and Authorization: External Information Systems • ITS-HBK-2810.02-06, Security Assessment and Authorization: Extending an Information System Authorization to Operate Process and Templates • ITS-HBK-2810.02-07, Security Assessment and Authorization: Information System Security Plan Numbering Schema • FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems • FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems • NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems • NIST SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems • NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations 4

The Section, and Parameter columns are intended to help navigate various NIST SP 800-53 security controls for easier application of the organizationally defined values; these columns are defined as follows: • Section: Values in this column indicate whether an organizationally defined value is in the main body of the control (Main), or part of one of the control’s enhancements (E1, E2, etc). • Parameter: Sometimes, a specific Section may have multiple organizationally defined values. In those instances, the bracketed number Parameters indicate which organizationally defined value (numbered sequentially) is being referenced. In the case of nested organizationally defined values, a series of bracketed numbers is used. 800 53 Reference FIPS 199 Categorization Family # Name Section Parameter Type Description Low Moderate High CA 01 Security Assessment and Authorization Policies and Procedures Main [1] Frequency Policy and procedure review. 1/Year 1/Year 1/Year CA 02 Security Assessments Main [1] Frequency Review of controls for need, and correctness of implementation.
