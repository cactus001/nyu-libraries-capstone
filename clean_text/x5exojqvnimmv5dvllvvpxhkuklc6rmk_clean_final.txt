C-125-B/C-125-C: Revised Proposed Successor-in-Interest Order 2 1 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728water rights holders in the Walker River Basin.1 In their respective subproceedings, the Plaintiff Parties have engaged in extensive service effort s on these water rights ho lders over a number of years. This Order addresses several overlapping service issues that have emerged from these efforts and are common to both subproceedings. Having reviewed and considered the record concerning service in these subproceedings, and the related filings and arguments of counsel, the Court has concluded that, with regard to defendants who have been served, service of the pleadings in these actions must have a defined end point and the Plaintiff Parties should be re lieved of the duty (1) to track such defendants perpetually, (2) to re-serve them if and when th ey acquire additional water rights in the same subproceeding, or (3) to serve suc cessors-in-interest to water ri ghts if and when defendants who have been served transfer any of these rights. In the interest of ensuring that service will have an end point, this Order addresses the treatment and finality of service with respect to defendants who transfer their claims to water rights afte r having been served, defendants who have been served and acquire additional claims to water ri ghts at issue in the same subproceeding, and the obligations of named defendants who transfer a claim to water right prior to service. This Order also addresses the treatment of successors-in-interest to clai ms to water rights following the death of a defendant who has been served. NOW THEREFORE, the Court FINDS and ORDERS as follows: 1 To date, for example, the United States reports that it has served over 3,800 persons and entities pursuant to this Court’s Case Management Order, (C-125-B Doc. 108), and Mineral County reports that it has served over 1,000 Walker River Decree water rights holders, (C-125-C Doc. 496).

Treatment of Successors-in-Interest As a Result of an Inter Vivos2 Transfer: The Court finds that after litigation has been commenced, the substitution or joinder of a successor-in-interest is governed by Federal Ru le of Civil Procedure 25 (“Fed. R. Civ. P. 25”). Hilbrands v. Far East Trading Co. , 509 F.2d 1321, 1323 (9th Cir. 1975); Fischer Bros. Aviation, Inc. v. NWA, Inc. , 117 F.R.D. 144, 146 (D. Minn. 1987) (citing Froning's, Inc. v. Johnston Feed Serv. , 568 F.2d 108, 110 (8th Cir. 1978)); P P Inc. v. McGuire , 509 F. Supp. 1079, 1083 (D.C.N.J. 1981) (citing 7A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1958 (1972)). Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(c) governs the substitution of successors-in- interest that are the result of an inter vivos transfer and provides in relevant part that “[i]f an interest is transferred, the action may be continued by or against the original part y unless the court, on motion, orders the transferee to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(c). “The most significant feature of Rule 25(c) is that it does not require that anything be done after an interest is tr ansferred. The action may be continued by or against the original party, and the judgment will be bindi ng on his successor-in-interest even though he is not named.” In re Bernal , 207 F.3d 595, 598 (9th Cir. 2 000) (citing 7C Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1958 (2d Ed.1986)); see also Luxliner P.L. Export Co. v. RDI/Luxliner, Inc. , 13 F.3d 69, 71 (3d Cir.1993); P P Inc. v. McGuire , 509 F. Supp. at 1083 (citing Froning's, Inc. , 568 F.2d 2 Inter vivos means among the living. Transfers that occur because a served defendant has died are addressed below Case 3:73-cv-00128-RCJ-WGC Document 2 Filed 02/23/11 of 9

Thus, where a defendant has been served in a subproceeding and subsequently sells or otherwise conveys a wate r right or portion of a wate r right subject to that subproceeding, a successor-in-interest need not be re-served, but will be bound by the results of this litigation. Once a defendant has been served in a s ubproceeding, the burden of keeping track of inter vivos transfers of the defendant’s water right s in that subproceeding and substituting the defendant’s successors-in-interest properly is born by the defendant and its successor(s)-in-interest. The action will contin ue in the name of the served defendant until such time as the served defendant and any successor(s)-in-interest file an agreement and motion seeking the substitution of th e successor(s)-in-interest for the served defendant and the Court appr oves that substitution. If a defendant who has been served in a s ubproceeding subsequently sells or otherwise conveys a water right or a portion of a wate r right subject to that subproceeding, that defendant and its successor(s)-in-interest may move for substitution pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(c). If the Court approves the substitution of a su ccessor-in-interest for a served defendant in a subproceeding, the action will continue agai nst the successor-in-in terest, who will be treated as a served defendant for the pende ncy of the subproceeding and shall be bound by the requirements of this Order and a ll prior and subsequent Orders in that subproceeding. in Section II.

C-125-B/C-125-C: Revised Proposed Successor-in-Interest Order 5 1 23456789 If a defendant who has been served in a s ubproceeding subsequently acquires additional water rights that are subject to that subproceed ing, the prior service on the defendant shall be effective as to all wate r rights held by that defenda nt, including any rights acquired subsequent to service. The Court has approved the attached forms (Attachments A and B) for use by defendants and their successors-in-interest in subp roceedings C-125-B and C-125-C, respectively, under the above circumstances. Attachments A and B set forth a joint motion by which both the current defendant and its successor( s)-in-interest may identify the rights transferred and indicate their agreement that the successor(s)-in-interest be substituted into the applicable subproceeding for the water rights addressed. These forms are not the exclusive means by which successors-in-interest may be substituted into this action. II. Treatment of Successors-in-Intere st As a Result of a Death: The Court finds that Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(a) gove rns substitution of successors-in-interest as a result of a death and provides, in relevant part: “If a pa rty dies and the claim is not extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper party. A motion for substitution may be made by any party or by th e decedent’s successor or representative. If the motion is not made within 90 days afte r service of a statement noting the death, the action by or against the decedent must be dism issed.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(a)(1). If no such notice or suggestion of death is made on the record, the case may proceed to judgment with the original named parties. 4 James Wm.

Cir. 1985); Rende v. Kay , 415 F.2d 983, 985-86 (D.C. Cir. 1969); Kessler v. Southeast Permanente Med. Group of NC, P.A. , 165 F.R.D. 54, 56 (E.D.N.C. 1995) (citing 7C Charles A. Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1955 (1986 and Supp.1995)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(a)(3) (service require ments for a statement noting death). Any statement noting the death of a defendant must be filed in all appli cable subproceeding(s). In other words, if a decedent is only a defendant in subproceed ing C-125-B, the notice need only be filed in that case. If, howeve r, the decedent is a defendant in C-125-B and C-125-C, the notice must be filed in bot h subproceedings. A notice filed in one subproceeding shall not be construed as “servi ce of a statement noting the death” in the other subproceeding for purposes of complyi ng with this Order or FRCP 25(a). Should a death be formally noted on the record by service of a statement noting the death that is filed in the appropriate subproceeding( s), the Tribe and United States, in the case of C-125-B defendants, or Mi neral County, in the case of C-125-C defendants, or any other party or the decedent’s representative a nd/or successor(s)-in-inte rest shall move for substitution of the proper succes sor-in-interest within 90 days of such notice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(a). The 90-day period may be extended pursuant to Rule 6(b), which provides the Court the discretion to enlarge this period. Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b) 1963 amendment advisory committee’s note to 1963 amendment; Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(1)(1) advisory committee’s note to 1963 amendment. Absent service of a statement noting the de ath in a subproceeding, the case may proceed against the original named parties in that subproceeding and will bind any and all successors-in-interest. If a successor-in-interest is alr eady defendant in either subpro ceeding as a joint tenant or pursuant to other joint ownership of the right(s) owned by the decedent, no action is required and the subproceeding will continue against the successor-in-interest.

Treatment of Defendants in Subproceed ing No. C-125-C Who Transferred Their Interest(s) Prior to Service: The provisions of this Section III pertain only to Subproceeding C-125-C. The approved Service Package in Subproceeding C-125-B already includes an Order – Disclaimer of Interest and form entitled Disclaimer of Interest in Wa ter Rights and Notice of Related Information and Documentation Supporting Disclaimer to address this issue. If any person or entity receiving service by mail or pe rsonal service has no interest in any water right subject to subproceeding C-125-C, that person or entity sha ll notify the Court and Mineral County in wr iting of that fact. If such a person or entity sold or otherwise conveyed ownership of all water rights subject to Subproceeding C-125-C before being served or otherwise brought into Subproceeding C-125-C, in addition to disclaim ing any interest in C-125-C, that person or entity shall include a notice providing the same succe ssor-in-interest information required to be included in a motion for substitution. The form and substance of the disclaimer and notice for C-125-C shall substantially conform to the form attached to this Order as Exhibit C and shall be sent to the Court and counsel for Mineral County. Any person or entity who files a Disclaimer of Interest using the attached form or provides information for this purpose by othe r means is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of that filing. Consequently, any pe rson or entity who files a notice regarding water rights subject to this li tigation, but retains such water rights, shall nevertheless be bound by the results of this litigation.
