Before: PAEZ a nd IKUTA, C ircuit Judge s, and B OLTON,*** Distric t Judge . Rex Lewis a ppeals the distric t court’ s orde r (1) de nying his m otion for re lief from judgm ent pursua nt to R ule 60 of the Federal Rules of C ivil Proc edure, (2) denying his m otion to m odify an asset-freezing injunc tion to a llow him to withdra w up to $15,000 a month from his IR A, (3) ruling tha t his re sidence was subje ct to e xecution unde r Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of C ivil Proc edure as a sanction for viola ting a post-judgm ent disc overy orde r, and (4) striking Le wis’s reply memorandum in support of obje ctions to a magistra te judge ’s report a nd recommendation. W e have jurisdic tion unde r 28 U.S.C . §§ 1291 a nd 1292(a )(1) because the distric t court’ s post-judgm ent orde rs either are final with the respect to the issues raised or de ny modific ation of a n injunc tion. See Nat. Re s. De f. Counc il, Inc. v. Sw. Marine Inc., 242 F.3d 1163, 1166 (9th C ir. 2001). W e affirm . The distric t court did not a buse its disc retion in de nying Le wis’s motion for relief from judgm ent unde r Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of C ivil Proc edure on the ground tha t the motion wa s untim ely. A R ule 60(b) m otion “ must be made within a reasonable time.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c )(1); see Ashford v . Steuart, 657 F.2d 1053, 1055 (9th C ir. 1981) (pe r curiam).

the interest in fina lity “great weight” because the time to appeal had passed, and the distric t court did not c learly err in finding tha t neither the “reason for de lay” nor “ the practical ability of the litiga nt to le arn earlier of the grounds re lied upon” weighed in fa vor of re asonableness. Ashford , 657 F.2d a t 1055. Furthe r, the record supports the finding tha t Lewis c ould ha ve made the argum ents advanced in his m otion for re lief from judgm ent as early as the summary judgm ent sta ge, whic h occurred years be fore he filed his R ule 60(b) m otion. As suc h, his m otion is be tter construe d as a motion for re conside ration unde r Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Proc edure, whic h wa s like wise prope rly denied as untim ely and as pre senting a merits a rgum ent tha t Lewis c ould ha ve raised earlier in the litiga tion. Fe d. R. Civ. P. 59(e ); Kona Ente rs., Inc . v. Estate of Bishop , 229 F.3d 877, 890 (9th C ir. 2000). In the alternative, the distric t court did not a buse its disc retion in de nying relief unde r Rule 60(b) on the merits. B ecause Lewis c ould ha ve made his argum ents to the distric t court be fore entry of fina l judgm ent, he did not e stablish “mistake, inadvertence, surprise , or e xcusable neglect” necessary for re lief unde r Rule 60(b)(1), a nd he did not “ establish the existence of extraordina ry circumstances whic h pre vented or re ndered him unable to prose cute an appeal” necessary for re lief unde r Rule 60(b)(6). Mac key v. Hoffman , 682 F.3d 1247, 1251 3

(9th C ir. 2012) (quoting Marte lla v. Marine Cooks & Stewards Union , 448 F.2d 729, 730 (9th C ir. 1971) (pe r curiam)). The distric t court a lso did not a buse its disc retion in de nying Le wis’s motion for re lief from judgm ent unde r Rule 60(d). B ecause the record re flects tha t Lewis could ha ve brought the pertinent contra ct language to the court’ s attention a t the time of sum mary judgm ent, the appellees’ failure to do so wa s not fra ud on the court. See Lavender v. Probe r (In re Lavender), 180 F.3d 1114, 1119 (9th C ir. 1999). The distric t court did not a buse its disc retion in de nying Le wis’s motion to modify an asset-freezing injunc tion tha t restricts him from transferring a ssets of greater than $5,000 in va lue without c ourt a pprova l. The distric t court re asonably took into a ccount e vidence that Lewis wa s dire cting his a ttorne ys to e vade post- judgm ent disc overy in a manner that thre atened to re nder the distric t court’ s judgm ent ine ffectual. Cf. Commodity Future s Trading C omm’n v . Noble Metals Int’l, Inc ., 67 F.3d 766, 775 (9th C ir. 1995) (noting tha t distric t courts should exercise their disc retion in light of whe ther “wrongdoing” has been shown). Section 21.090(1)(r)(1) of the Nevada Revised Statutes doe s not fore close the distric t court’s ruling, a s the injunc tion doe s not de clare Lewis’s IRA account subje ct to e xecution or re quire Lewis to c ontribute exempt assets to his judgm ent 4

debt.1 The unm odifie d injunc tion le aves Lewis fre e to m ake transfers of le ss tha n $5,000 without c ourt supe rvision a nd the refore does not “ fail[] to afford [Le wis] any access to funds to pa y an attorne y.” Fed. Sav . & Loan Ins. C orp. v. Ferm, 909 F.2d 372, 375 (9th C ir. 1990). The distric t court did not a buse its disc retion in im posing sa nctions unde r Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i) a nd (ii) tha t prevented Lewis from introduc ing e vidence to establish tha t his re sidence met the statutory criteria for e xemption from execution or tha t the residence was contra ctually prote cted from execution. The distric t court did not c learly err in finding tha t Lewis willfully viola ted a prior disc overy orde r by refusing to m ake necessary disclosure s regarding his inte rest in the residence, or in finding tha t Lewis repeatedly evaded and hinde red the post-judgm ent disc overy process in orde r to frustra te the judgm ent creditors’ execution. The distric t court could re asonably anticipate continue d deceptive conduc t, and “[i]t is appropria te to reject lesser sanctions whe re the court a nticipates continue d deceptive misconduc t.” Conn. Ge n. Life Ins. C o. v. New Image s of Be verly Hills , 482 F.3d 1091, 1097 (9th C ir. 2007). Le wis’s deception a nd evasion c reated a high risk of 1 To the extent Lewis c hallenges the unde rlying asset-freezing injunc tion a s inconsiste nt with se ction 21.090(1)(r)(1), we reject that argum ent as well. See Alto v. Blac k, 738 F.3d 1111, 1120 (9th C ir. 2013) (“ [A] subse quent challenge to the injunc tive relief must re st on grounds tha t could not ha ve been raised before.”). 5

prejudice to the appellees, and unde r these circumstances it wa s not a n abuse of discretion to tre at these factors a s dispositive . See Adriana Int’l C orp. v . Thoe ren, 913 F.2d 1406, 1412 (9th C ir. 1990). Finally, the distric t court did not a buse its disc retion by exercising its inherent powe r to strike Lewis’s reply memorandum in furthe r support of his objections to the magistra te judge ’s report a nd re commendation. See Ready Transp., Inc . v. AAR Mfg., Inc ., 627 F.3d 402, 404 (9th C ir. 2010). “ Broad deference is give n to a distric t court’ s inte rpretation of its loc al rule s.” Bias v . Moynihan , 508 F.3d 1212, 1223 (9th C ir. 2007). The distric t court re asonably interpreted its loc al rule s to prohibit the filing of re ply memoranda without le ave of the court. See D. Ne v. L.R . IB 3-2(a ) (2011) (providing only for obje ctions a nd oppositions to obje ctions). B ecause Lewis did not re quest and re ceive leave to file the memorandum , the distric t court did not e rr in finding tha t the memorandum had been file d in contra vention of the local rule s, the reby warranting tha t it be struc k from the docket.
