GOVERNOR ROBERT L. EHRLICH, JR. “FACE S OF MARYL AND” SPE ECH Joint Sess ion of the Mar yland Gener al Assem bly January 29, 2003 Senate Pres ident Mik e Miller ; Spea ker Mike Bu sch; Mem bers of the General Assem bly; Lt. Governor Steele; Chief Judge Bell; Judge Vau ghan; Atto rney General J oe Curran; Treasurer Nancy Kopp; Com ptroller W illiam Donald Schaef er; m embers of Congress; county executives and mayors; special gue sts; friends and fellow Marylanders: What a trem endous honor it is to be standing before you today as Maryland’s governor. I am so happy to be here – back with m y friends in the Maryland General Assem bly. There are so m any good, hard work ing people on both sides of the aisle – all eager to do what’s right for the citizens of Maryland. I served here for eight years – a trem endous experience for a young legislator. I’ll always cherish the tim e I spent here. I made great friends and benefited from great mentors. Many still serve in this body, and others have joined m y adm inistration. I experienced how the legislativ e process works, as well as th e importance of princip led cooperation. I observed and participated in serious debates about issue s that matter to e very citiz en: crime, drugs, education, healthcare, transporta tion, tort reform, the Chesapeake Bay, and juvenile justice. The Maryland General Assem bly represents ev erything that a citizen legislatu re shou ld be: diverse, colleg ial, effectiv e, inform ed and vigilant. Serving here prepared m e for the challenges and dem ands of being an effective pu blic s ervant. To all th e freshm en m embers of the Assem bly, I encourage you to savor this experience. I also encourage you to m ake the most of it. You can do that by getting to know some of the veteran m embers. Neither party has a m onopoly on talent in th is legislature. Many of the people in this room represent th e best of public service: I would like to single out seven of these l ong-serving m embers today. 1

Together these m embers have won 126 races and served a total of 225 years in this historic Assem bly. Please s tand as I call you r nam e. - Delegate W ade Kach: 28 years of service. - Delegate Joe Valla rio: 28 years of service. - Delegate Hattie N. Harris on: 30 years of service. - Delegate John Arnick: 31 years of service. - Delegate Pauline Menes: 36 years of servic e. - Senator Norm an Stone: 40 years of service. - Senate Pres ident Mik e Miller : 32 years of service. It’s appropriate to celebra te public service, and the thoughtful people who choose to serve. They sym bolize what is good and decent about th is historic citizen legislatu re, and we thank them. Maryland continues to be an intellectual force powe ring the region. W e possess exceptional institutions of higher education such as Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland. In the field of m edical resear ch, Maryland is an internationa l leader, as dem onstrated by the world-renowned Johns Hopkins Medicine, University of Maryland Medical System s, and National Institutes of Health. Further, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and the Natio nal Aquariu m in Baltimore both speak to the state’s reputa tion as a science center. The Port of Baltim ore is world fa mous, and we are the center of the biotechnology universe. Our citizens are highly educated, and our per ca pita personal incom e is the sixth highest in the na tion. As citizens of Maryland, we have a lot in whic h we can take pride. Still, there are a reas in which we can do better. We need to m ake our streets and co mmunitie s safer. Accor ding to FBI statistics, Maryland continues to be one of the most violent states in the nation. Further, the link between crim e and drugs remains unbreakable. A 2001 study perform ed at Baltim ore City’s central booking f acility found that nearly three-qu arters of arrestees tested positive for at least one drug. 2

While the need for drug treatm ent program s is high, the need is not currently being m et. Presently, th ere are 7,50 0 taxpayer-funded treatm ent program s in Baltimore City, and an estim ated 55,000 people requiring treatm ent. When it com es to the environm ent, th ere are challenges wa iting for us, too. Despite m illions of dollars invested in environm ental clean up, the health of the Chesapeake Bay is precarious. A 2002 study by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation found that the Bay’s health, which scored 27 out of 100 in 1998, achieved the sam e low score in 2002. You’ve heard m e recite a num ber of statistics. Statis tics are serious business. Sometimes, they can be downright scary. Bu t let m e ask you to set them aside for a mom ent, and consider the people behind the numbers. Many of the issues facing us seem so difficult, so intractab le, that we lose sight of the human face associated w ith th eir challenges. Sometimes we need to see – to touch – to f eel – the real im pact of these issues on the lives of citizens in order to better understand them. Sitting in fro nt of you today are five indivi duals who help us put a “Maryland face” on these issues. Listen to th eir stories; they encom pass so m any lessons that can help us achieve a better plac e to live, grow, work, and prosper. First, I’d like you to m eet Captain Bob Newberry. Captain Bob is 45 years old and li ves in Crum pton, Maryland. He has been a Marylander since 1966, when his fa mily m oved to Queen Anne’s County from Philadelphia. Captain Bob has been a waterm an since he wa s 15 years old. For him , being a waterm an means “having som ething in your blood, and never hating to go to work.” Today he fishes, crabs, harvests oysters, fa rms, and operates one of the few aquaculture farms on the Eastern Sho re. Three years ago, he took on extra wo rk as a part-tim e charter boat captain because it w as becom ing more difficult to ear n his livelihood through fishing. New regulations have harm ed his ability to do his job. A sign ificant d rop in the Bay’s oyster and crab populations are al so threatening his industry. Several years ago, the value of his av erage daily oyster catch was up to $2000. 3

--- Page 3 ---
Today, a typical catch falls within the $400 - $500 range. He fears that next yea r’s oyster ha rvest will b e the worst eve r. The blue crab is not faring m uch better. Crabs have becom e increasingly difficult to catch since the 1980s. The fem ale crab population has declined an estim ated 80 pe rcent since then, and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation reports that the risk to the re maining population is “high and increasing.” Captain Bob is not the only person w hose livelihood has suffered as a result. There are 7,000 licensed fisherm en who earn th eir livelihood from the sea in Maryland. They are res ponsible for an estim ated 1 m illion p ounds of harvest annually, repres enting $86 m illion in annual in come and 3,168 jobs. Many feel that they have been unfairly blam ed for the plight of the Bay. They note that the poor water quality has killed off underwa ter sea grasses, leaving crabs vulnerable to predatory fish. They report that the oyster populatio n is sufferin g because sh ells are no t being replenished. These hardy individuals are the stew ards of our environm ent. Many live their entire lives on its banks. They have an intim ate appreciati on of its beauty, its species, its problem s, and its v itality. It is tim e to stop blam ing them , and to sta rt listening to th em. One day, in the not too distant future, there may be no fish, oysters, or crabs unless we achieved m easurable progress in cleaning up the Bay. That m eans upgrading the 66 major m unicipal s ewage trea tment plants th at cleanse its wate rs. My capital b udget m akes a $95 m illion down paym ent in this area. That’s a good start, but we will clea rly need additiona l resources to g et the job do ne. We will nee d to secur e more dolla rs from the f ederal gov ernment in order to com plete this c ritical task. That must be a join t effort betw een the Asse mbly and this administration. The Chesapeake Bay is central to ou r iden tity. It perm eates every aspect of our econom ic, ecological, recreational life. Its he alth affects the livelihood and well being of every Maryland fa mily. 4

We’ve heard the phras e “politics end s at th e water’s edge” a lot since 9/11. I believe that sentim ent ap plies to the waters of th e Chesapeak e Bay as well. I believe that we can protect it without unduly penalizing the good pe ople who earn their livelihood from it. Now, I’d like you to m eet Adela Acosta, principal of Cesar Chavez Elem entary School in Prince George’s County. We’ve heard the phras e “no child left behind” in recen t years. Adela was the stud ent who sim ply would not allow herself to be left behind. Adela was born in Puerto Rico, and later imm igrated to New York’s Spanish Harlem . When she enrolled in kindergarten at the age of five, she found it a very scary experience. “A foreign language enveloped m e,” she woul d later write. “E nglish sounded like rocks dropping in a river. My teachers seem ed to thi nk that if they spoke to m e in a very lou d voice I would understand what they were saying.” Eventually, her teachers labeled her as learni ng impaired, and she was placed in a special education class in firs t grade. Fortunately, a social worker discovered her, and she was sent to St. Paul’s parochial school. There she learned the joy and power of reading as a m eans of comfort and escape. Her fortunes improved, but she faced other obs tacles. Her father – a heroin addict – becam e blind as the result of a beating by neighborhood bullies. Adela becam e his surrogate eyes, read ing to him , tending to his needs. In effect, she becam e his teacher. One day, she inform ed her eigh th grade teach er that she wanted to teach o ne day. The teacher advised her to g o into show busine ss because – and I quote – “yo u people are so good at it.” Fortunately, Adela decided to follow her heart instead. She went on to earn an underg raduate degree in Secondary E ducation from the University of Kansas, and a Master of Science in Edu cation Degree from the University of Kansas. She has begun doctoral studies in E ducation Le adership at Nova Sout heaste rn Univ ersity in Florid a. Today, the girl once dism issed as learning-im paired is a na tionally recog nized educator. 5

President Bush appointed her to the Comm ission on Excellence in Special Education. And First Lady Laura Bush – a form er teacher herself – nam ed her a National Role Model for Education Refor m. In 1999 she helped open Cesar Chavez Elem entary School. As principal, she presides over a diverse student body: 47 percent Hi spanic, 49 percent African Am erican, and 4 percen t white. Ninety-n ine percent of her students rece ive Title I funding. The girl whose potential was once overlooked by her teachers is now looking out for new generations of disadvantaged students. Because of Adela, no ch ild is left behind at Cesar Chavez! Adela’s exp eriences as a student and an educat or have taught her som e important lessons. She knows that social prom otion policy only hu rts kids and sends the wrong m essage to taxpayers. She knows that every student should com pete on a level playing field, and that fully funding the Thornton Comm ission’s recomm endations is cr itical to her m ission. I agree with Adela. That is why our budget increases education aid $242 m illion – includ ing $1 48 m illion u nder the Tho rnton f ormula. She and I both support the es tablishm ent of another comm ission – Thornton II – devoted to an exam ination of education policy in Maryland. Lieutenant Governor Steele will lead this im portant effort! Finally, s he supports a real ch arter school bill that will encou rage com petition in ou r public school system . Passing charter school legi slation is one of m y top priorities for this session. It is tim e for this Assem bly to ena ct a char ter schools bill with teeth – one that will give disadvantaged students the opportunity to pursu e their dream s. I ask you to do so this year. Now let m e introdu ce yo u to Keith D ay. Keith is a 45 years old fam ily m an. He and his wife Devorah live in Baltim ore. They’ve been m arried 14 years and have three children. Keith works as Assistant Manager at the Sh eraton Inner Harbor Hotel, where he was named Employee of the Year back in 2001. He is a m ember of the New Shiloh Baptist Church. 6

--- Page 6 ---
Keith’s story is sim ilar to those of tens of thousands of hard working Marylanders. But things haven’t always gone easily for Keith. For 25 years, Keith battled an addiction to heroin. His addiction was so powerful and destruc tive that he spen t three y ears living on th e stree ts of Baltim ore. His life changed when he connected with the Helping Up Mission, a faith-based organiz ation based in Ba ltimore. Each year, the m ission serves 150,000 m eals a nd provides 55,000 beds to poor citizens. However, the m ission provides m uch m ore than a warm meal and a bed. It serves hope as well. The m ission’s innovative spiritual recovery pr ogram enables addicts to find the path towards re covery, em ploym ent, and bette r life skills. The results s peak for them selves: pro gram graduates have an 80 percent chance of being employed and sober a year later. Now Keith is clean, sober, and helping people battle their own addi ctions by volunteering at in the m ission. Congratulations, Keith Gun violence – dom estic abuse – sexually tr ansm itted disease – lack of ed ucation al opportunity – overcrowding in our crim inal justice system - over-representation of minority youth in prison – all are dir ectly related to our drug culture. It cuts through every line in our society. It does not care about who you are – or what you do – the color of your skin – or the size of your bank account. It does no t discrim inate on the bas is of race, creed, or color. It makes us bleed. It des troys f amilies – an d futures. It strikes fear in the heart of every parent. I am the parent of a three-year-old – I am scared! Our budget spends nearly $136 m illion on alcoh ol and drug treatm ent pro grams – a 4.2 percent increase over last year in FY 04. 7

--- Page 7 ---
This is a good start, but we can – and m ust – do better. We m ust work together to get non-violent drug offenders out of jail and into treatm ent program s, where they belong. We m ust stress early diversion initiatives. We need to stop routinely condem ning so many young offenders to the adult crim inal justice system through incarceration and neglect. We will enc ourage f aith organiz ations of every denom ination to of fer trea tment program s. Faith-based initiatives can achieve on a ti ny budget results that the federal governm ent and state of Maryland have been unable to duplicate despite spendi ng billions of dollars. Lieutenant Governor Steele will lead this effort. It will involve every subdivision in our State – it is a priority for our adm inistration. It’s tim e to f acilita te success, and to empower the problem solvers in our society. Now, let’s m eet Michael Taylor. Michael was born in Baltim ore in 1958, and attended Hillend ale Elem entary School. When he was 12 years o ld, he was placed in the Rosewood Center. Michael spent the next three decades of his lif e locked away in institu tions. “While I was in Rosewood, I didn’t have m y freedom ,” Michael later said. “I couldn’t decorate m y room the way I wanted. I couldn’t call people on the phone without perm ission. I was not happy there.” The cost of being institutiona lized in Maryland f or 30 years is conservatively es timated at $1.6 m illion . But we can’t calcu late th e cost it ex acted on Michael’s quality of life. Michael was released from Rosewood just four years ago. H e began working for the “Living Free Cam paign” and “Stand Up a nd Speak Out” – two groups that prom ote freedom and em powerment f or the institu tionalized. On April 16, 2002, Michael did som ething he had been waiting to do his entire life. He m oved into his very own apartment. He calls his new apartm ent, located in To wson, his “Freedom Pad,” because nobody else lives there. 8

--- Page 8 ---
As Michael gained his freedom , his life started to flourish. He secured a new job with “Best Buddies of Maryland”. His activism has earned him awards from the State Independent L iving Council, Baltim ore County Commission on Disabilities, and ARC of Mary land. He also lobbies on beha lf of the disabled, so m any of you m ay know hi m already. Michael Tay lor is an American success story. He is a Maryland success story. And he is a success s tory for any individual who faces obstacles and ch alleng es in h is life. He embodies the success and wisdom of our i nvestm ent in community-based services. My 2004 budget includes im portant program s that will help people in sim ilar circum stances live with independence, digni ty, and self-sufficiency. These include: • $5.2 m illion for the Tran sition ing Yo uth Program to help you th with disab ilities graduate from school into productive living and working environm ents • $6.9 m illion to fund the Developm ental Dis abilities W aiting List to g et people th e services they need now • $3.1 m illion to respond to em ergencies faced by fam ilies in crisis, su ch as when an older parent caring for their adult child can no longer provide that care • $16 m illion to increase the wages th at pers onal care workers receive to as sist those with d isabilities to ensu re a high quality of care. • In total, funding for community services for individuals with developmental disabilities increas es by $38.3 m illion for FY 2004 Other im portant funding initiatives I have pr oposed assist Marylanders with comm unity- based initiatives, including: • For Seniors : $7.3 m illion for 1,000 addition al placem ents for the Med icaid Older Adults W aiver to m ove people out of nur sing homes and back into their hom es. • For Youth: $1 m illion f or a Juvenile Services Dr ug Court Initia tive to help Maryland ’s youth get th e drug treatm ent they need without needless ly filling up state juven ile facilities. • For people with m ental illn ess: An ove rall $66 m illion increase for FY 03 and FY 04 for the Mental Hygiene Adm inistrati on community services budget. This money will help res tore our public mental h ealth system to ensure that it cares for people in the community again. 9

• An overall $ 66 m illion increas e for FY 03 and FY 04 f or the Menta l Hygiene Adm inistration commun ity services budget This is a new day in Maryland. We must usher all Ma rylanders into the 21st Century by m oving people out of institutions and into co mmunities, where they live, lear n, work and thrive like everyone else. It is tim e to give every Marylander the tool s and opportunities to m ake their own choices. Our last guest is not with us today. Rio-Jarell T atum was the son of John S. Tatum and Roxanne Servance. They raised the kind of kid that would m ake any parent proud. Rio graduated from Baltim ore’s Polytechnic Ins titute’s rigo rous A Course in June 20 01. At Poly, he was captain of the baseball and soccer team s. People rem ember his b lazing fastball as well as seem ing inexhaustibility on the athletic field. Others recall his polite, confident, self-assured m anner. But his acad emic prowess stands ou t the m ost. He was a m ember of the National Ho nor Society, earning an incredible 3.97 grade point average. In Septem ber 2001 he entered Penn State with a full scholarship. On May 26, 2002, an arm ed robber shot Rio on a Baltim ore street. He died at Shock Traum a. I wish I’d had the chance to m eet this exceptional young m an. The things that m ade a big difference in his li fe – sports, scholarships, and fa mily – also impacted m ine. Here is a k id who did everyth ing rig ht, yet still b ecam e a victim of the gun violence sweeping our state’ s largest city. Rio’s story should be a wake-up call for all of us. As long as g un-toting crim inals roam our st reets and communities, no on e – not even the best and brightest am ong us – is saf e. That is why it is tim e to bri ng Project Exile to Maryland. During its first year in R ichmond, Vi rginia, Proj ect Exile cut violent cr ime in half. It is time we bring this successf ul program to Maryland, too. 10

Thank you, John Tatum and Roxanne Servance, for joining us here today. These are ju st a f ew of the f ascinatin g people I m et during the journey that ultim ately brought Kendel, Drew, Michael, Andrea, and I to Annapolis. As we go about the business of getting our fiscal house in order and m aking difficult decis ions ab out spendin g priorities, let’s keep in mind these, and so many other faces of Maryland w ho depend on us to protect them from injustice – provide a cleaner environm ent – guarantee a quality education – provide tem porary assistance when needed – and m ake our streets safer. We have an opportunity and an oblig ation to do great things in each of th ese critical areas. For that to happ en, we m ust fully em brace the sp irit o f cooperatio n I first encountered in these halls as a young legislator so m any years ago. That spirit has stayed with m e throughout m y public service career, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to bring it back here. Of course, we will dis agree a t times – som etimes vigorous ly. But I am conf ident the se disagre ements will no t underm ine our ability to a chieve p rogress. That is what the citizen s of Maryland deserve. Maryland faces problems that are daunting, not insurm ountable. None will s tand when confronted with the energy and enterpri se of the people in this room . I look forward to workin g closely with each of you. Together we have the chance to change Maryland. Thank you and God bless you. 11
