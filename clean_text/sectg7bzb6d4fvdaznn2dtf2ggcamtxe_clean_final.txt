Permit 23 Condition 111. 11.1.5 outlines the process by which waste sources in the IDF are modeled 24 in an ongoing risk budget and a ground water impact analysis. 25 III.11.1.1 Six months prior to IDF operations Permittees shall submit to Ecology for review, 26 approval, and incorporation into the permit, all waste acceptance criteria to address, at a 27 minimum, the following: physical/chemical criteria, liquids and liquid containing waste, 28 land disposal restriction treatment standards and prohibitions, compatibility of waste with 29 liner, gas generation, packaging, handling of packages, minimization of subsidence. 30 111.11.1.1.a All containers/packages shall meet void space requirements pursuant to 31 WAC 173-303-665(12). 32 III.11.1.1.b Compliance Schedule 33 111.1 1.1.b.i Six months prior to IDF operations, the Permittees shall submit to Ecology for review, 34 approval, and incorporation into the permit any necessary modifications to the IDF Waste 35 Analysis Plan (Chapters 3.0 of the IDF portion of this permit). 36 111.11.1.2 ILAW Waste Acceptance Criteria 37 The only ILAW forms acceptable for disposal at IDF are: (1) approved glass canisters 38 that are produced in accordance with the terms, conditions, and requirements of the WTP 39 portion of the Permit, and (2) the 50 bulk vitrification test boxes as specified in the 40 Demonstration Bulk Vitrification System (DBVS) test plans. 41 To assure protection of human health and the environment, it is necessary that the 42 appropriate quality of glass be disposed at IDF. The Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) 43 Treatment Standard for eight metals (arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, 44 mercury, selenium and silver), when associated with High Level Waste, is HLVIT 45 (40 CFR 268). Because these metals are constituents in the Hanford Tanks Waste, the 46 LDR standard for ILAW disposed to IDF is HLVIT. Conditions. 10

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I For any ILAW glass form(s) that DOE intends to dispose of in IDF, DOE will provide to 2 Ecology for review, an ILAW Waste Form Technical Requirements Document 3 (IWTRD). The IWTRD will contain: 4 111.11.I.2.a WTP ILAW Waste Acceptance Criteria 5 Ill.11.1.2.a.i A description of each specific glass formulation that DOE intends to use including a basis 6 for why each specific formulation is proposed for use, which specific tank wastes the 7 glass formulation is proposed for use with, the characteristics of the glass that are key to 8 satisfactory performance (e.g., VHT, PCT, and TCLP and/or other approved performance 9 testing methodologies that the parties agree are appropriate and necessary), the range in 10 key characteristics anticipated if the specific glass formulation is produced on a 11 production basis with tank waste, and the factors that DOE must protect against in 12 producing the glass to ensure the intended glass characteristics will exist in the actual 13 ILAW. 14 Ill.11.1.2.a.ii A performance assessment that provides a reasonable basis for assurance that each glass 15 formulation will, once disposed of in IDF in combination with the other waste volumes 16 and waste forms planned for disposal at the entire Integrated Disposal Facility, be 17 adequately protective of human health and the environment; and will not violate or be 18 projected to violate all applicable state and federal laws, regulations and environmental 19 standards. 20 Within 60 days of a request by Ecology, the Permittees shall provide a separate model 21 run using Ecology's assumptions and model input. 22 11.1.2.a.iii A description of production processes including management controls and quality 23 assurance/quality control requirements that assure that glass produced for each 24 formulation will perform in a reasonably similar manner to the waste form assumed in the 25 performance assessment for that formulation. 26 The Permittees shall update the IWTRD consistent with the above requirements for 27 review by Ecology consistent with their respective roles and authority as provided under 28 the TPA. Ecology comments shall be dispositioned through the Review Comment 29 Record (RCR) process and will be reflected in further modeling to modify the IDF ILAW 30 Chapter 3.0, Waste Analysis Plan as appropriate. 31 The initial IWTRD contained glass formulation data as required by Permit 32 Condition 111.1 l.I.2.a.i, and was submitted on December 18, 2006 (AR Accession # 33 0906020182). The performance assessment required by Permit Condition 111.1 1.1.2.a.ii, 34 and the quality assurance/quality control requirements process required by Permit 35 Condition 111.1 1.1.2.a.iii shall be submitted for Ecology review as soon as possible after 36 issuance of the Final Tank Closure and Waste Management Environment Impact 37 Statement (EIS) and receipt of underlying codes and data packages, and at least 180 days 38 prior to the date DOE expects to receive waste at IDF. At a minimum, the Permittees 39 shall submit updates to the IWTRD to Ecology every five years or more frequently with 40 the next one due June 30, 2015, if any of the following conditions exist: 41 * The Permittees submits a permit modification request allowing additional waste 42 forms to be disposed of at IDF. 43 * The WTP or other vitrification facility change their glass formulations from those 44 previously included in the IWTRD. 45 * An unanticipated event or condition occurs that Ecology determines would warrant 46 an update to the IWTRD. 47 III.11.1.2.a.iv The Permittees shall not dispose of any WTP ILAW not described and evaluated in the 48 IWTRD. Conditions. 11

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 111.11.1.3 ILAW Waste Acceptance Criteria Verification 2 111.11.1.3.a Six months prior to disposing of ILAW in the IDF, the Permittees will submit an ILAW 3 verification plan to Ecology for review and approval. This plan will be coordinated with 4 WTP, Ecology, and the Permittees personnel. This plan will outline the specifics of 5 verifying ILAW waste acceptance through WTP operating parameters, and/or glass 6 sampling. The Plan will include physical sampling requirements for batches, glass 7 formulations, and/or feed envelopes. 8 111.11.1.4 Demonstration Bulk Vitrification System (DBVS) Bulk Vitrification Waste Acceptance 9 Criteria 10 111.1 1.1.4.a Bulk Vitrification waste forms that are acceptable to be disposed of at IDF are up to 11 50 boxes of vitrified glass produced pursuant to the DBVS Research, Development, and 12 Demonstration (RD&D) Permit from processing Hanford Tank S-109 tank waste. 13 111.1 1.1.4.b If Bulk Vitrification is selected as a technology to supplement the Waste Treatment Plant, 14 the IDF portion of the Permit will need to be modified to accept Bulk Vitrification Full 15 Scale production waste forms. This modification will need to be accompanied by 16 appropriate Tri-Party Agreement (TPA) changes (per M-062 requirements) and adequate 17 risk assessment information sufficient for the Department of Ecology to meet its State 18 Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) obligations. 19 III.11.1.4.c DBVS Waste Acceptance Verification will occur on 100% of the waste packages. 20 Pursuant to the DBVS RD&D Permit, a detailed campaign test report will be produced 21 and submitted to Ecology detailing results of all testing performed on each waste package 22 that is produced. IDF personnel shall review these reports to verify that the waste 23 packages meet IDF Waste Acceptance Criteria. 24 111.11.1.4.d The Permittees shall not dispose of any waste forms that do not comply with all 25 appropriate and applicable treatment standards, including all applicable LDR. 26 111.11.1.5 Modeling -Risk Budget Tool 27 111.1 1.1.5.a The Permittees must create and maintain a modeling -risk budget tool, which models the 28 future impacts of the planned IDF waste forms (including input from analyses performed 29 as specified in Permit Conditions 111.1 1.1.2.a through 111.1 1.I.2.a.ii) and their impact to 30 underlying vadose and ground water. This software tool will be submitted for Ecology 31 review as soon as possible after issuance of Final Tank Closure and Waste Management 32 EIS and receipt of underlying codes and data packages, and at least 180 days prior to the 33 date DOE expects to receive waste at IDF. The risk budget tool shall be updated at least 34 every 5 years. The model will be updated more frequently if needed, to support permit 35 modifications or SEPA Threshold Determinations whenever a new waste stream or 36 significant expansion is being proposed for the IDF. This risk budget tool shall be 37 conducted in manner that is consistent with state and federal requirements, and represents 38 a risk analysis of all waste previously disposed of in the entire IDF (both cell I and cell 2) 39 and those wastes expected to be disposed of in the future for the entire IDF to determine 40 cumulative impacts. The groundwater impact should be modeled to evaluate fate and 41 transport in the groundwater aquifer(s) and should be compared against various 42 performance standards including but not limited to drinking water standards (40 CFR 141 43 and 40 CFR 143). Ecology will review modeling assumptions, input parameters, and 44 results and will provide comments to the Permittees. Ecology comments shall be 45 dispositioned through the Review Comment Record (RCR) process and will be reflected 46 in further modeling to modify the IDF ILAW waste acceptance criteria as appropriate. 47 11.1.5.a.i The modeling-risk budget tool will include a sensitivity analysis reflecting parameters 48 and changes to parameters as requested by Ecology. Conditions. 12

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Ill.11.1.5.a.ii If these modeling efforts indicate results within 75% of a performance standard 2 [including but not limited to federal drinking water standards (40 CFR 141 and. 3 40 CFR 143)], Ecology and the Permittees will meet to discuss mitigation measures or 4 modified waste acceptance criteria for specific waste forms. 5 III.11.1.5.a.iii When considering all the waste forms to be disposed of in IDF, the Permittees shall not 6 dispose of any waste that will result (through forward looking modeling or in real 7 groundwater concentrations data) in a violation of any state or federal regulatory limit, 8 specifically including but not limited to drinking water standards for any constituent as 9 defined in 40 CFR 141 and 40 CFR 143. 10 111.11.1.6 The Permittees shall not dispose of any waste that is not in compliance with state and 11 federal requirements as identified in Chapter 13.0. 12 111.11.I.6.a In accordance with DOE's authority under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended 13 and other applicable law, prior to disposing of any mixed immobilized low-activity waste 14 (ILAW) in the IDF, DOE will certify to the State of Washington that it has determined 15 that such ILAW is not high-level waste and meets the criteria and requirements outlined 16 in DOE's consultation with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission beginning in 1993 17 (Letter from R.M. Bernero, USNRC to J. Lytle, USDOE, dated March 2, 1993; Letter 18 from J. Kinzer, USDOE, to C. J. Paperiello, USNRC, Classification of Hanford Low- 19 Activity Tank Waste Fraction, dated March 7, 1996; and Letter from C.J. Paperiello, 20 USNRC, to J. Kinzer, USDOE, Classification of Hanford Low-Activity Tank Waste 21 Fraction, dated June 9, 1997). While the requirement to provide such certification is an 22 enforceable obligation of this permit, the provision of such certification does not convey, 23 or purport to convey, authority to Ecology to regulate the radioactive hazards of the waste 24 under this permit. 25 111.11.1.7 IDF Operational Waste Acceptance Criteria. 26 111.1 1.7.a IDF operational activities (including decontamination, cleanup, and maintenance) will 27 generate a small amount of waste. Waste that can meet IDF waste acceptance without 28 treatment will be disposed of at the IDF. All other IDF operational waste will be 29 managed pursuant to WAC 173-303-200. 30 Conditions.13

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility X. Other Environmental Permits (see instructions) A. Permit Type B. Permit Number C. Description XI. Nature of Business (provide a brief description that includes both dangerous waste and non-dangerous waste areas and activities) The Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF) is an expandable lined landfill located in the 200 East Area of the Hanford Facility. The landfill is divided lengthwise into distinct east and west cells, one for disposal of low- level radioactive waste (the east cell) and the other for disposal of mixed waste (the west cell). The cell for disposal of low-level radioactive waste is outside the scope of this permit. Mixed waste disposed at the IDF is currently limited to vitrified low-activity waste (LAW) from the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) and Demonstration Bulk Vitrification System (DBVS). Additionally, mixed waste generated by IDF operations will be disposed of in IDF. (The IDF Permit requires modification if other waste streams are proposed for disposal.) The vitrified waste form generated by both the WTP and the DBVS facilities is known as Immobilized Low Activity Waste (ILAW) .The amount shown in Section XII of 2-hectare meters (82,000 cubic meters) is the waste capacity of the initial construction. The amount will be revised as required for future expansion to accommodate the entire waste volume through an approved permit modification. D80 Mixed radioactive high level wastes stored in the Double-Shell and Single-Shell Tank System carry the characteristic dangerous waste numbers D002, and D004 through D011 .The specified technology based treatment standard for high-level radioactive waste as described in 40 CFR 268.40 (vitrification) will be used to produce the waste form that will be placed in steel canisters or steel boxes. Tank waste will meet this vitrification standard as the waste exits at the Waste Treatment Plant or Demonstration Bulk Vitrification System Facility. (Permit conditions for the WTP and DBVS require that the D001 and D003 waste codes be removed prior to the waste stream entering these facilities.) IDF operational activities (including decontamination, cleanup, and maintenance) will generate a small amount of waste. Waste that can meet IDF waste acceptance without treatment will be buried at the IDF. All other IDF operational waste will be managed pursuant to WAC 173-303-200 and either sent to a 90-day accumulation area or directly to another permitted TSD for treatment. Treated IDF operational waste will either be buried at IDF or sent to another permitted Hanford TSD for final disposition. Sol Process Code SO1 (container storage) has been included within this Part A Form in the event that storage is required before final disposal (e.g., to support the staging and confirmation process of the waste or cooling of vitrified waste if required).

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility XIV. Description of Dangerous Wastes Example for completing this section: A facility will receive three non-listed wastes, then store and treat them on-site. Two wastes are corrosive only, with the facility receiving and storing the wastes in containers. There will be about 200 pounds per year of each of these two wastes, which will be neutralized in a tank. The other waste is corrosive and ignitable and will be neutralized then blended into hazardous waste fuel. There will be about 100 pounds per year of that waste, which will be received in bulk and put into tanks. B. Estimated D. Processes Line A. Dangerous Annual C.

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 3.0 INTEGRATED DISPOSAL FACILITY WASTE ANALYSIS PLAN 2 Pursuant to WAC 173-303-300(5) this waste analysis plan (WAP) documents the waste acceptance 3 process, sampling methodologies, analytical techniques, and overall processes that will be undertaken for 4 mixed waste accepted for disposal at the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF). .Mixed waste disposed at 5 the IDF will be limited to vitrified low-activity waste (LAW) from the RPP-WTP and DBVS and mixed 6 waste generated by IDF operations. (see Chapter 1, Part A Form). Vitrified LAW generated by RPP- 7 WTP is known as Immobilized Low Activity Waste (ILAW) and generated by DBVS is known as Bulk 8 Vitrified Waste (BVW). The IDF will be located in the 200 East Area of the Hanford Facility. 9 The IDF also will receive low-level waste for disposal. Mixed waste will not be placed in the low-level 10 waste portion of the IDF. The requirements of this WAP are applicable to mixed waste and are not 11 applicable to the low-level radioactive waste. The term 'treatment, storage, and/or disposal (TSD) unit' is 12 used throughout this WAP to refer to the IDF. Activities will be performed by the IDF operating 13 organization, waste acceptance organization, or its delegated representative. 14 Although the treatment and disposal of radioactive waste (i.e., source, special nuclear, and by-product 15 materials as defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954) are not within the scope of Resource 16 Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of l976 or WAC 173-303, information is provided for general 17 knowledge. 18 3.1 Description of Unit Processes and Activities 19 The IDF will be a single, expandable disposal facility constructed to RCRA Subtitle C standards, half of 20 which is for disposal of mixed waste the other half will be for disposal of low-level waste. Initial capacity 21 for mixed waste disposal is 82,000 cubic meters of waste with an ultimate capacity of up to 450,000 cubic 22 meters of waste. Disposal capacity beyond the initial 82,000 cubic meters will require a modification to 23 the Part B Permit. The mixed waste types to be disposed in the IDF include vitrified LAW from the 24 RPP-WTP and DBVS. Additionally, mixed waste generated by IDF operations will be disposed of in 25 IDF. 26 The mission of the RCRA portion of the IDF is to provide an approved disposal facility for the 27 permanent, environmentally safe disposition of mixed waste and RCRA waste. 28 For ILAW, and BVW the container packaging and handling will be designed to maintain containment of 29 each waste type, limit intrusion, and limit human exposure at the IDF. ILAW containers will be 30 transported from the RPP-WTP to the IDF using a tractor-trailer system. BVW will be transported from 31 the DBVS staging area to IDF using a similar system. Transport of the ILAW and BVW to the landfill 32 will occur along a pre-determined route. 33 The lined landfill will have a leachate collection and removal system. The leachate collection tanks will 34 be operated in accordance with the generator provisions of WAC 173-303-200 and are not subject to this 35 WAP. 36 Additional information is located in Chapter 1.0 (IDF Part A) and Chapter 4.0 (Process Information). 37 3.2 Identification and Classification of Waste 38 The ILAW, BVW, and newly generated mixed waste will be accepted for disposal. The mixed waste 39 disposed of at the IDF is received from waste generated within IDF, and two other Hanford Facility TSD 40 units (RPP-WTP and DBVS). The following waste will not be accepted for disposal at this TSD unit: 41 * Waste is not accepted for disposal when the waste contains free-standing liquid unless all 42 free-standing liquid: 43 o Has been removed by decanting or other methods. 44 o Has been mixed with sorbent or stabilized (solidified) so that free-standing liquid is no longer 45 observed. 46 o Otherwise has been eliminated. Chapter 3.8

--- Page 44 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 o Container is very small, such as an ampoule. 2 o Container is a labpack and is disposed in accordance with WAC 173-303-161 or 40 CFR 3 264.316. 4 o Container is designed to hold free liquids for use other than storage, such as a battery or 5 capacitor. 6 There could be cases in which small amounts of residual liquids are present in mixed waste containers 7 because condensate has formed following packaging or free liquids remain in debris items (e.g., 8 pumps, tubing) even after draining. When it is not practical to remove this residual liquid, the free 9 liquid must be eliminated to the extent possible by adding a quantity of sorbent sufficient to sorb all 10 residual liquids. 11 Free liquid is determined by SW-846, Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste: Physical/Chemical 12 Method, Method 9095 (Paint Filter Liquids Test) [WAC 173-303-140(4)(b) and 40 CFR 264.314(d)] 13 only for waste that has the potential for free liquid formation. 14 * Gaseous waste not accepted for disposal if the is waste packaged at a pressure in excess of 1.5 15 atmospheres at 200C. 16 * Pyrophoric waste is not accepted for disposal. Waste containing less that 1 weight percent 17 pyrophoric material partially or completely dispersed in each package is not considered 18 pyrophoric for the purposes of this requirement. 19 * Solid acid waste is not accepted for disposal [WAC 173-303-140(4)(c)]. 20 * Extremely hazardous waste that does not meet WAC 173-303-140(4)(d) is not accepted for 21 disposal. Extremely hazardous waste that has been treated could be disposed in accordance with 22 Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 70.105.050(2), "Hazardous Waste Management." 23 * Organic/carbonaceous waste that does not meet WAC 173-303-140(4)(d) is not accepted for 24 disposal. 25 * Waste not meeting the LDR treatment standards is not accepted for disposal [40 CFR 268 and 26 WAC 173-303-140(4)]. 27 * Waste streams will be evaluated during pre-shipment review to ensure that the waste streams do 28 not contain constituents incompatible with the liner system in concentration sufficient to degrade 29 the liner. Table 1 provides a list of chemicals shown to be incompatible with the liner material at 30 100% concentrations (WHC-SD-WM-TI-714). In general, mixed waste that meets federal and 31 state treatment standards would be compatible with the TSD unit liner system. Waste accepted at 32 the IDF will be compatible with the liner. Constituents in Table I will not be accepted for 33 disposal (refer to Section 3.4.9 for waste stream compatibility). 34 3.3 Management of Waste 35 The ILAW, BVW, and newly generated wastes (see Section 3.3.1) generated during normal. operations of 36 this TSD unit are accepted at this TSD unit for disposal. The two onsite TSD units (RPP-WTP and 37 DBVS) transferring/shipping waste to this TSD unit hereafter are referred to as the 'generator' unless 38 otherwise denoted in this WAP. The waste acceptance process for transfers from the generator is 39 identified in Figure 1. 40 Written waste tracking procedure(s) are implemented to ensure waste received at the TSD unit matches 41 the manifest or transfer papers, to ensure that the waste is tracked though the TSD unit to final 42 disposition, and to maintain the information required in WAC 173-303-380. The waste tracking process 43 provides a mechanism to track waste through a uniquely identified container. The unique identifier is a 44 barcode (or equivalent) that is recorded in the Solid Waste Information Tracking System (SWITS). This 45 mechanism encompasses the waste acceptance process, the movement of waste, the processing of waste, 46 and management of the waste. Chapter 3.9

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The container identification number provides traceability between the TSD unit and the hard copy of 2 records that are maintained as part of the operating record to ensure information relative to the location, 3 quantity, and physical and chemical characteristics of the waste are available. 4 The following sections describe the process for waste acceptance and the different types of information 5 and knowledge reviewed/required during the acceptance process. The process for management of waste 6 is described in Section 3.4. 7 3.3.1 Newly Generated Waste within the IOF 8 This TSD unit generates mixed waste as a result of operational (e.g., chemical, radiological) activities. 9 These activities include, transfer functions along with inspection, decontamination, cleanup, maintenance 10 tasks and leachate collection. The IDF generated operational waste will be maintained in accordance with 11 generator provisions of WAC 173-303-200 and WAC 173-303-600(3)(d). Any newly generated waste 12 (except leachate) not meeting IDF waste acceptance criteria will be designated and sent to another 13 permitted TSD or to a 90 day accumulation area. IDF leachate will be managed in accordance with 14 WAC 173-303-200 and transferred to the Liquid Effluent Retention Facility/Effluent Treatment Facility 15 (LERF/ETF) (or other permitted TSD) for treatment. Solids or residuals resulting from IDF leachate 16 treatment may be designated/packaged and sent back to the IDF for burial or to another permitted TSD. Chapter 3.10

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 3.4 Confirmation Process 2 WAC 173-303-300(1) requires confirmation on mixed waste before acceptance of waste into a waste 3 management unit. The confirmation process consists of two parts, pre-shipment review, and verification. 4 Confirmation activities are performed in accordance with TSD unit-specific governing documentation. 5 The confirmation process is detailed in Figure 2 for ILAW and BVW. 6 3.4.1 Pre-Shipment Review 7 Pre-shipment review takes place before waste can be scheduled for transfer or shipment to this TSD unit. 8 The review focuses on whether the waste stream is defined accurately and meets the TSD unit waste 9 acceptance criteria and whether the LDR status is determined correctly. Only waste determined to be 10 acceptable for storage (see Section 3.4.1.2.2) and/or disposal is scheduled. This determination is based on 11 the information provided by the generator. The pre-shipment review consists of waste stream approval 12 and the waste shipment approval process. The following sections discuss the pre-shipment review 13 process. The information obtained during the pre-shipment review, at a minimum, includes all 14 information necessary to safely dispose of the waste. The pre-shipment review ensures the waste is 15 characterized and the data provided qualify as 'acceptable knowledge' (Section 3.4.1.4). 16 3.4.1.1 Pre-Shipment Review of Wastes 17 Pre-shipment review for ILAW and BVW waste containers will take place at RPP-WTP and the DBVS 18 staging area respectively before either type of containers can be scheduled for transfer to the IDF. The 19 review will focus on whether the waste stream is defined accurately, meets the waste acceptance criteria, 20 and the land disposal restrictions (LDR) status was determined correctly. Only waste determined to be 21 acceptable for storage (see Section 3.4.1.2.2) and/or disposal will be scheduled. This determination will 22 be based on the information provided by the generator. The pre-transfer review will consist of the waste 23 profile documentation and waste transfer approval process. The following sections discuss the 24 pre-transfer review process. ILAW and BVW containers received for land disposal will be at least 90% 25 full. The information obtained from the generator, at a minimum, will contain five elements: 26 (1) Documentation to ensure waste can be managed pursuant to the Part A, Form 3. 27 (2) Documentation to ensure the waste is not a prohibited waste in accordance with Section 3.2, 28 (3) A determination if the waste is an ignitable, reactive, or incompatible waste as defined in 29 WAC 173-303-040. 30 (4) Documentation that waste meets LDR requirements of 40 CFR 268 and WAC 173-303-140. 31 (5) Operational restrictions on acceptance of waste. 32 During the waste profile documentation process for ILAW and BVW containers, the generator will have 33 the responsibility to provide relevant information pertaining to the proper management of the waste. 34 Characterization information pertaining to the treatment of ILAW and BVW will be obtained during the 35 waste profile documentation process. 36 3.4.1.2 Waste Stream Approval Process for Wastes 37 The waste stream approval process consists of reviewing stream information supplied on a waste stream 38 profile and supporting documentation to allow receipt of the waste into the IDF. Waste stream 39 compatibility (i.e., compatibility between individual waste streams and compatibility between waste 40 streams and landfill design and construction parameters) will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. 41 Criteria for assessing and determining compatibility will be identified in either the facility Waste 42 Acceptance Criteria, Waste Analysis Plan, or other protocol or procedure as appropriate. 43 3.4.1.2.1 Waste Stream Approval for ILAW and BVW 44 During the waste profile documentation process, the IDF waste acceptance organization will obtain the 45 following information: Chapter 3.12

--- Page 48 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Description of waste generating process 2 * Characterization data 3 * Dangerous waste numbers 4 * LDR data (as specified in Section 3.4.10) 5 * Composition of ILAW and BVW including regulated constituents of concern (refer to Chapter 6 1.0 of the permit application -Part A Form) 7 The waste profile documentation process will be as follows. 8 1. Appropriate generator fills out waste profile documentation. 9 2. The IDF designated waste acceptance organization reviews the waste profile information against 10 the waste acceptance criteria for each ILAW or BVW transfer. 11 3. If discrepancies are noted, the IDF designated waste acceptance organization requests additional 12 information from the generator to address discrepancies for either: (1) inconsistent information 13 and (2) information not constituting acceptable knowledge (refer to Section 3.4.1.4.1). 14 Information (waste profile documentation) is resubmitted by the generator addressing concerns in 15 Item 3. 16 * If concerns are addressed, waste profile documentation is approved. 17 * If concerns are not addressed and met, waste profile documentation is not approved until concerns 18 are corrected. 19 3.4.1.2.2 Waste Stream Approval for Newly Generated Mixed Waste 20 The waste stream approval process for wastes generated during IDF operations (except for leachate) 21 consists of reviewing stream information supplied on a waste stream profile and supporting 22 documentation. The waste stream profile requires the following supporting documentation: 23 * Generator information (e.g., name, address, point-of-contact, telephone number) 24 * Waste stream name 25 * Waste generating process description 26 * Waste numbers 27 * Chemical characterization information (e.g., characterization method(s), chemicals present, 28 concentration ranges) 29 * Designation information 30 * LDR information including identification of underlying hazardous constituents if applicable 31 * Waste type information (e.g., physical state, adsorbents used, inert materials, stabilizing agents 32 used) 33 * Packaging information (e.g., container type, maximum weight, size). 34 Attachments could consist of container drawings, process flow information, analytical data, etc. 35 In some cases, such as variable waste streams, the waste stream profile information could be general in 36 nature. In these cases, more detailed information is gathered during the waste shipment approval process 37 on a per shipment basis. This information is reviewed against the TSD unit waste acceptance criteria to 38 ensure the waste is acceptable for receipt. If conformance issues are found during this review, additional 39 information is requested that could include analytical data or a sample to be analyzed. 40 If the waste cannot be received, the TSD unit pursues acceptance of the waste at an alternate TSD unit. 41 Once the waste meets the waste acceptance criteria, the TSD unit assigns the profile to a waste 42 specification record and establishes a waste verification frequency based on the requirements found in 43 Section 3.4.2. Profile information is re-evaluated as discussed in Section 3.4.7. Chapter 3.13

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 3.4.1.3 Waste Transfer/Shipment Approval Process 2 After the appropriate generator has received the waste profile documentation approval from IDF (refer to 3 Section 3.4.1.2.1), the generator waste transfer will be subjected to the waste transfer approval process. 4 Only those ILAW and BVW containers approved under the waste profile documentation as part of the 5 waste transfer approval process will be transferred to the IDF. During the waste transfer approval 6 process, the IDF designated waste acceptance organization will obtain the following information. 7 For each ILAW or BVW container transfer that is a candidate for disposal in the TSD unit, the generator 8 will provide the following information: 9 * Container identification number 10 * Profile number 11 * Waste description 12 * Generator information (e.g., name, address, point-of-contact, telephone number) 13 * Container information (e.g., type, size, weight) 14 * Waste numbers 15 * LDR certification 16 * Packaging materials and quantities 17 The ILAW and BVW container transfer approval process will be as follows. 18 1. The generator obtains information from existing database, operating record, or generator records 19 on each ILAW container to be transferred under the approved waste profile documentation. 20 2. Information is submitted to the TSD unit designated waste acceptance organization by the 21 generator and is reviewed for the following: 22 * Consistency with approved waste profile documentation. 23 * Consistency with waste acceptance criteria within the IDF. 24 3. If discrepancies are identified, the TSD unit designated waste acceptance organization will 25 request additional information from the generator to address any discrepancies. 26 4. Information (waste package documentation) is resubmitted by the generator addressing concerns 27 in tem 3. 28 5. If discrepancies are addressed, this information is forwarded to the TSD waste acceptance 29 organization. 30 6. If discrepancies are not addressed, transfer is not approved until discrepancies are corrected. 31 3.4.1.4 Acceptable Knowledge Requirements 32 The TSD unit ensures that all information used to make waste management decisions is based on 33 adequate characterization data as described in the following sections. The TSD unit evaluates the data to 34 ensure that the data are adequate acceptable knowledge for management of the waste. 35 3.4.1.4.1 General Acceptable Knowledge Requirements 36 One or more of the following types of information could be considered, provided that the information is 37 of sufficient quality to demonstrate compliance with applicable waste acceptance criteria: 38 * Mass balance from a controlled process that has a specified output for a specified input. 39 * Material safety data sheet on chemical products. 40 * Test data from a surrogate sample. 41 * Analytical data on the waste or a waste from a similar process. Chapter 3.14

--- Page 50 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 In addition, acceptable knowledge requirements can be met using a combination of analytical data or 2 screening results and one and/or more of the following information: 3 * Interview information 4 * Logbooks 5 * Procurement records 6 * Qualified analytical data 7 * Radiation work package 8 * Procedures and/or methods 9 * Process flow charts 10 * Inventory sheets 11 * Vendor information 12 * Mass balance from an uncontrolled process (e.g., spill cleanup) 13 * Mass balance from a process with variable inputs and outputs (e.g., washing/cleaning methods) 14 If the information is sufficient to quantify the constituents of regulatory concern and to determine waste 15 characteristics as required by the regulations and TSD unit waste acceptance criteria, the information is 16 considered acceptable. Adequate acceptable knowledge includes (1) general waste knowledge 17 requirements and/or (2) LDR waste knowledge requirements. 18 (1) General waste knowledge requirements. At a minimum, the generator supplies enough information 19 for the waste to be managed at this TSD unit (refer to Section 3.4.1.1). The minimum level of 20 acceptable knowledge consists of designation data where the constituents causing a waste number to 21 be assigned are quantified and that data address any TSD unit operational parameters necessary for 22 proper management of the waste. 23 When process knowledge indicates that constituents, which if present in the waste might cause the 24 waste to be regulated, are input to a process, but not expected to be in the waste, sampling and 25 analysis must be performed to ensure the constituents do not appear in the waste above applicable 26 regulatory levels. This requirement can be met through chemical screening. This sampling and 27 analysis are required only for initial characterization of the waste stream. 28 When the available information does not qualify as acceptable knowledge or is not sufficient to 29 characterize a waste for management, the sampling and testing methods outlined in 30 WAC 173-303-110 are used to determine whether a waste designates as ignitable, corrosive, reactive, 31 and/or toxic and whether the waste contains free liquids as applicable. If the analysis is performed to 32 complete characterization after acceptance of the waste by the TSD unit, this WAP governs the 33 sampling and testing requirements. 34 (2) LDR waste knowledge. The TSD unit operating record contains all information required to 35 document that the appropriate treatment standards have been met or will be met after the waste is 36 treated unless otherwise excepted in this section. 37 * Both ILAW and BVW will be LDR compliant waste streams prior to acceptance at the IDF. 38 Vitrification at the WTP and DBVS will facilitate LDR compliance for the majority of the 39 mixed waste disposed of at IDF. IDF operational waste will be treated as needed to meet 40 LDR at another TSD other than WTP or the DBVS 41 * This TSD unit may use analytical data as necessary to ensure that the applicable requirements 42 found in 40 CFR 268.7 and WAC 173-303-140(4) are met. Chapter 3.15

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 3.4.1.4.2 Methodology to Ensure Compliance with LDR Requirements 2 The generators are subject to LDR requirements and are required to submit all information notifications 3 and certifications described in WAC 173-303-380(1), (j), (k), (n), and (o). Mixed waste not meeting the 4 treatment standards cannot be disposed at this TSD unit. 5 The following are general requirements for certification or information notification. 6 * The waste is subject to LDR and the waste has been treated. The generator supplies the 7 appropriate LDR certification information (40 CFR 268). 8 * The waste is subject to LDR and the generator has determined that the waste meets the LDR as 9 generated. The generator develops the certification based on process knowledge and/or analytical 10 data and supplies the appropriate LDR certification information necessary to demonstrate 11 compliance with the LDR treatment standards of 40 CFR 268 and WAC 173-303-140. State-only 12 LDRs do not require this type of certification. 13 When demonstrating that a concentration-based LDR treatment standard has been met, a representative 14 sample of the waste must be submitted for analysis. This sample could be taken by the treatment facility 15 or the generator and is required to comply with the LDR treatment standards contained in 40 CFR 268.40 16 and 268.48 for underlining hazardous constituents. 17 3.4.2 Verification 18 Verification is an assessment performed by this TSD unit to substantiate that the waste received is the 19 same as represented by the analysis supplied by the generator for the pre-shipment review. Verification 20 for ILAW and BVW containers will contain one element, a 100% container receipt inspection. 21 Physical/chemical screening will not be performed on the ILAW or BVW containers. Waste is not 22 accepted by the TSD unit for disposal until the required elements of verification have been completed, 23 including evaluation of any data obtained from verification activities. All conformance issues identified 24 during the verification process are resolved in accordance with Section 3.4.3. Verification activity results 25 will be documented by the IDF designated waste acceptance organization. 26 Sampling and analysis for non-vitrification mixed waste (e.g., treatment residues from treatment of IDF 27 leachate that are returned to IDF for disposal) will not occur at the IDF but will occur at another permitted 28 TSD. 29 3.4.2.1 Container Receipt Inspection 30 Container receipt inspection is a mandatory element of the confirmation process. 31 3.4.2.1.1 Container Receipt Inspection for ILAW and BVW 32 The ILAW and BVW container receipt inspection will be performed by IDF designated waste acceptance 33 organization. The following criteria will be evaluated during container receipt inspection: 34 * Number of containers 35 * Size of containers 36 * Labels 37 * Container integrity 38 Discrepancies identified during the container receipt inspection will be communicated to generator. 39 Discrepancies will be resolved before the containers are unloaded. Once the discrepancies are resolved, 40 the ILAW containers will be unloaded and disposed. Should discrepancies remain unresolved after 41 30 days, Ecology will be notified and daily walk around inspections conducted. 42 3.4.2.2 Physical Screening Process 43 The ILAW and BVW containers are not required to be physically screened because the generator verifies 44 the waste meet the waste acceptance criteria for IDF. Chapter 3.16

--- Page 52 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 3.4.2.3 Chemical Screening Process 2 Chemical screening is a verification element for containerized mixed waste. The ILAW and BVW 3 containers are not required to be chemically screened because the generator verifies the waste meet the 4 waste acceptance criteria for IDF. 5 3.4.3 Waste Acceptance 6 Initial acceptance of waste occurs only after the confirmation process described in Section 3.4 is 7 complete. Conformance issues identified during the confirmation process are documented and managed 8 in accordance with Section 3.4.1.2.2. Conformance issues that must be corrected before waste acceptance 9 include the following: 10 * Waste that is not identified in the Part A, Form 3 (Chapter 1.0). 11 * Waste does not match approved profile documentation. 12 * Designation, physical, and/or chemical characterization discrepancy. 13 * Incorrect LDR paperwork. 14 * Packaging discrepancy. 15 * Manifest discrepancies as described in WAC 173-303-370(4). 16 For waste shipments with unresolved conformance issue(s) that exceed 90 days, this TSD will notify 17 Ecology at least once per calendar quarter.

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 3.4.4 Selecting Waste Analysis Parameters 2 The ILAW and BVW containers will be managed without the need to perform sampling and analysis at 3 the TSD. No parameters will be required to be identified. 4 5 Table 2. Parameters and Rationale for Physical Screening Parameter Method* Rationale for selection Nondestructive examination Field method Confirm consistency between waste and shipping documentation. *Procedures based on manufacturer's recommended methodology unless otherwise noted. When regulations require a specific method, the method is followed. SW-846, Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, latest edition, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. WAC 173-303, "Dangerous Waste Regulations 6 7 3.4.5 Selecting Sampling Procedures 8 Any required sampling and analysis of the ILAW and BVW containers will be performed at the generator 9 before the containers are closed. Sampling and analysis for IDF operational mixed waste will not occur at 10 the IDF but at another Hanford TSD. 11 3.4.6 Selecting A Laboratory, Laboratory Testing, and Analytical Methods 12 Any required sampling and analysis of the ILAW and BVW containers will be performed before the 13 containers are closed at the RPP-WTP and DBVS respectively. No Laboratory, laboratory testing or 14 analytical methods will be required to be identified. 15 3.4.7 Selecting Waste Re-Evaluation Frequencies 16 The re-evaluation (repeat and review) frequency for ILAW to review a waste generating process and 17 associated waste profile documentation is every two years, or more often if conditions in 18 WAC 173-303-300(4)(a) arise. Since BVW will be generated over a shorter time period, frequency for 19 review will be every six months. 20 When a waste generating process and associated waste profile documentation is re-evaluated, IDF 21 personnel or designated waste acceptance organization could request the generator to do one or more of 22 the following: 23 * Verify the current waste profile documentation is accurate. 24 * Supply new waste profile documentation. 25 When a waste profile is re-evaluated, the TSD unit could request the organization generating the waste to 26 do one of the following: 27 * Verify the current waste profile is accurate. 28 * Supply a new waste profile. 29 * Submit a sample for parameter analysis. 30 3.4.8 Special Waste Analysis Procedural Requirements 31 Special procedural requirements for the IDF will include procedures for ignitable, reactive, and 32 incompatible waste, and provisions for complying with federal and state LDR requirements. This section 33 discusses any special process requirements for receiving mixed waste at this TSD unit. Chapter 3.19

--- Page 55 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 3.4.9 Procedures for Ignitable, Reactive, and Incompatible Waste 2 Waste stream compatibility (i.e., compatibility between individual waste streams and compatibility 3 between waste streams and landfill design and construction parameters) and waste stream ignitability will 4 be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Criteria for assessing and determining compatibility and ignitability 5 will be identified in either the facility Waste Acceptance Criteria, Waste Analysis Plan, or other protocol 6 or procedure as appropriate. Should these wastes be accepted, appropriate administrative and engineering 7 controls will be implemented as necessary. 8 This TSD unit does not accept reactive waste (refer to Section 3.2 and Section 3.4.1.1). The TSD unit 9 ensures that reactive waste is not accepted at this TSD unit in the following manner. 10 * Pre-shipment review will identify whether the waste is reactive based on the definition contained 11 in WAC 173-303-040. 12 * If analysis of the characterization information leads to a conclusion that the waste is a reactive 13 waste, the containers, or waste will not be accepted. 14 The types of prohibited waste not accepted at this TSD unit as listed in Section 3.2. 15 3.4.10 Provisions for Complying With Federal and State Land Disposal Restriction 16 Requirements 17 State-only and federal LDR requirements restrict the land disposal of certain types of waste subject to 18 RCRA and RCW 70.105, "Hazardous Waste Management", as amended. Waste managed on the Hanford 19 Facility falls within the purview of these LDRs per 40 CFR 268 and WAC 173-303-140. The treatment 20 standards for mixed waste disposed at IDF are based on the dangerous waste numbers accepted as 21 documented on the IDF Part A as well as additional information necessary for identifying treatability 22 groups etc. 23 The IDF will not perform sampling and analysis to determine compliance with treatment standards 24 contained in 40 CFR 268. Any sampling and analysis results required to demonstrate compliance with 25 concentration-based treatment standards contained in 40 CFR 268.40 will be obtained by IDF waste 26 acceptance organization from the generator, during the waste profile documentation process to meet the 27 requirements of 40 CFR 268.7(c)(2). Sampling and analysis results will be placed into the unit-specific 28 portion of the Hanford Facility operating record. Other LDR records are identified in 29 WAC 173-303-380(1)(m) and will be obtained from the generator, by IDF personnel as part of either the 30 waste profile documentation process or the waste transfer approval process. The treated waste must meet 31 all applicable LDRs to be accepted for disposal at the IDF. IDF will obtain the LDR certification from 32 the treatment unit. 33 Mixed waste constituents that are subject to LDRs are identified in 40 CFR 268.40 by reference in 34 WAC 173-303-140(2), the extremely hazardous waste disposal requirements for DOE facilities contained 35 in RCW 70.105.050(2), and the state-only LDRs contained in WAC 173-303-140(4)(b)-(d). The mixed 36 waste must meet certain treatment standards, as specified in 40 CFR 268.40, RCW 70.105.050(2), and 37 WAC 173-303-140(4)(b)-(d), if the waste is to be land disposed. Any waste requiring LDR treatment 38 must be treated prior to acceptance into the IDF. 39 State-only LDRs for mixed waste will be met in the following manner: 40 * Extremely hazardous waste disposal requirements in RCW 70.105.050(2) concerning "all 41 reasonable methods" will be met by the treatment performed to meet 40 CFR 268, 42 WAC 173-303-140(4)(b)-(d), and DOE requirements for disposal. If no treatment is required to 43 meet 40 CFR 268, WAC 173-303-140(4)(b)-(d), or DOE requirements, no treatment is required 44 to dispose of extremely hazardous waste at the IDF. 45 * Special requirements for bulk and containerized liquids in WAC 173-303-140(4)(b) are identical 46 to the landfill requirements contained in 40 CFR 264.314. Chapter 3.20

--- Page 56 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I For mixed waste, including the provisions when to perform the paint filter test, these 2 requirements are described in Section 3.2 of the WAP. 3 * Solid acid waste requirements in WAC 173-303-140(4)(c) can be met through knowledge of the 4 treatment process. Sampling and analysis following treatment is not required to meet this state- 5 only LDR. Disposal of treated solid acid waste still displaying the WSC2 characteristic can 6 occur only when the waste is treated to reduce the harmful properties or characteristics of the 7 waste. 8 * Organic/Carbonaceous waste prohibition requirements in WAC 173-303-140(4)(d) do not apply 9 to the Hanford Facility because the Hanford Facility is operating under 10 WAC 173-303-140(4)(d)(iii), in accordance with a sitewide 1,609 kilometers (1,000-mile) 11 inapplicability certification. Sampling and analysis is not required to determine the 12 organic/carbonaceous content of a mixed waste. 13 * Ecology allows treatment of Organic/Carbonaceous waste in lieu of meeting the inapplicability 14 certification requirements WAC-173-303-140(4)(d)(iii) through macro-encapsulation for 15 hazardous debris only. 16 3.4.11 Off-Specification Waste 17 Off-Specification ILAW or BVW is waste not meeting the waste acceptance criteria as described in 18 Section 3.4, Confirmation Process. ILAW or BVW streams determined to be off-specification may be 19 temporarily stored in the RCRA lined portion of the IDF pending resolution of discrepancy or return to 20 generating TSD as long as these wastes meet LDR. ILAW and BVW may be temporarily stored in the 21 RCRA lined portion of the IDF, provided the temperature administrative control limit is not exceeded, 22 until sufficiently cool for disposal. 23 3.5 Waste Tracking 24 The IDF will monitor and record the placement of waste packages. At the time of final placement of each 25 package, the position and serial number of the package will be logged. 26 3.6 Recordkeeping 27 Recordkeeping requirements that will be applicable to this WAP are as follows: 28 * Confirmation records described in Section 3.4 will be maintained in accordance with 29 Condition II.I.1.b of the Hanford Facility RCRA Permit, Dangerous Waste Portion (Ecology 30 2001). 31 * Waste profile documentation described in Section 3.4.1.2.1 will be maintained in accordance with 32 Condition II.l.1 j of the Hanford Facility RCRA Permit, Dangerous Waste Portion. 33 * LDR records described in Section 3.4.10 will be maintained in accordance with 34 WAC 173-303-380(1)(m) in the IDF unit-specific portion of the Hanford Facility operating 35 record. 36 3.7 References 37 Ecology, 2001, "Hanford Facility RCRA Permit, Dangerous Waste Portion", Washington State 38 Department of Ecology, Olympia, Washington as amended. 39 SW-846, Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste: Physical/Chemical Method, latest edition, Office of 40 Solid Waste, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. 41 WHC-SD-WM-TI-714, High-Density Polyethylene Liner Chemical Compatibility for Radioactive Mixed 42 Waste Trenches, 1995, Westinghouse Hanford Company, Richland, Washington. 43 Chapter 3.21

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4.0 PROCESS INFORMATION 2 This chapter discusses the processes that will be used to dispose waste in the IDF and includes a 3 discussion of the design and function of the following: 4 * Container 5 * Disposal landfill 6 * Leak detection system 7 * Leachate collection and removal system 8 * Secondary leak detection system 9 Note that the SLDS is not a design requirement of WAC 173-303-665, however DOE is adding the design 10 feature pursuant to its authority under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) and not for the purposes of 11 compliance with the dangerous waste regulations. Therefore, information regarding the design, 12 construction, and operation of the secondary leak detection system is provided in this application as 13 information only. Pursuant to AEA, DOE has sole and exclusive responsibility and authority to regulate 14 the source, special nuclear and by-product material component of radioactive mixed waste at DOE-owned 15 nuclear facilities. Source, special nuclear and by-product materials, as defined by AEA, are not subject to 16 regulation under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) or the Hazardous Waste Management 17 Act, by the State of Washington and are not be subject to State dangerous waste permit, orders, or any 18 other enforceable instrument issued there under. DOE recognizes that radionuclide data may be useful in 19 the development and confirmation of geohydrologic conceptual models. Radionuclide data contained 20 herein is therefore provided as a matter of comity so the information may be used for such purposes. 21 Waste stream compatibility (i.e., compatibility between individual waste streams and compatibility 22 between waste streams and landfill design and construction parameters) will be assessed on a case-by- 23 case basis. Criteria for assessing and determining compatibility is identified in the Waste Acceptance 24 Criteria, Waste Analysis Plan, or other protocol or procedure as appropriate (Chapter 3.0, for further 25 discussion of waste stream compatibility). 26 Process Code SO1 (container storage) has been included within this permit, in the event that storage is 27 required before final disposal (e.g., to support the confirmation process of the waste or cooling of vitrified 28 waste if required). Waste failing the confirmation process (Chapter 3.0) will be identified as off- 29 specification and may require storage prior to disposal. Only off-specification waste or vitrified waste 30 requiring cooling (due to process heat) may be stored in the lined portion of the IDF pending disposition. 31 To maintain operational flexibility, off-specification containers and vitrified waste requiring cooling 32 could be left on the transport vehicles at the IDF until disposal can occur but may be off-loaded into the 33 lined portion of the IDF pending final disposal provided the temperature administrative control limit is 34 not exceeded. Off-specification waste and vitrified waste requiring cooling will be separated from other 35 waste via tape, ropes, chains, or other cordon mechanism. 36 4.1 Containers 37 All mixed waste accepted for disposal at the IDF will be packaged in standard containers 38 [U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and/or DOE], unless alternate packages are dictated by the 39 size, shape, or form of waste (49 CFR 173) (e.g., metal boxes), and self-contained bulk waste. 40 4.1.1 Description of Containers 41 Mixed waste disposed at the IDF is limited to vitrified low-activity waste (LAW) from the RPP-WTP and 42 DBVS. Additionally, mixed waste generated by IDF operations will be disposed of in IDF. 43 The RPP-WTP and DBVS containers are designed specifically for the vitrified low activity waste form. 44 Nominal RPP-WTP container dimensions will be 122 centimeters base outside dimension, 45 107 centimeters top by 230 centimeters in length, with a wall thickness of 0.357 centimeter with a 46 container volume of 2.55 cubic meters. Chapter 4.5

--- Page 64 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The DBVS container dimensions are approximately 2.4 meters wide by 3.1 meters tall and 7.3 meters 2 long and a container volume of 54 cubic meters. The vitrified low activity waste will be compatible with 3 the containers, stainless steel for RPP-WTP and carbon steel for DBVS. Before receipt at the IDF, 4 containers will be closed by the generator. 5 Due to the radioactivity and remote handling of the RPP-WTP immobilized waste containers, 6 conventional labeling of the vitrified immobilized waste containers will not be feasible and an alternative 7 to the standard labeling requirements will be used. This alternative labeling approach will use a unique 8 alphanumeric identifier that will be welded onto each immobilized glass waste container. The welded 9 "identifier" will ensure that the number is always legible, will not be removed or damaged during 10 container decontamination, will not be damaged by heat or radiation, and will not degrade over time. 11 The identifier will be welded onto the shoulder and sidewall of each immobilized glass container at two 12 locations 180 degrees apart. Characters will be approximately 2 in. high by 1.5 in. wide. The identifier 13 will be formed by welding on stainless steel filler material at the time of container construction. This 14 identifier will be used to track the container from receipt at the RPP-WTP, throughout its subsequent path 15 of shipment and disposal at the IDF. 16 Each identifier will be composed of unique coded alphanumeric characters. This unique alphanumeric 17 identification will be maintained within the plant information network, and will list data pertaining to the 18 waste container including waste numbers, and the major risk(s) associated with the waste. 19 Mixed waste generated through waste operations at IDF will be packaged based on the size of the waste, 20 with the most common container being galvanized or aluminized 208-liter containers. 21 The container packaging and handling for the IDF are designed to maintain containment of the waste, 22 limit storage intrusion, and limit human exposure to mixed waste. Unusual sized containers such as 23 vitrified LAW packages will be handled by using cranes or other appropriate equipment. 24 Operations personnel will inspect each container to confirm appropriate documentation and compliance 25 with the waste acceptance criteria before the container is placed in the IDF (refer to Chapter 3). 26 If containerized mixed waste must be opened (i.e., for confirmation sampling, repackaging, etc.), the 27 container typically would be removed to an onsite treatment and/or storage unit or other approved 28 location before being opened. The container would be sealed before being returned to the IDF. 29 4.2 Leachate Collection Tanks 30 The aboveground leachate collection tank supports the lined IDF landfill. The leachate collection tank 31 will be operated in accordance with the generator provisions of WAC 173-303-200 and 32 WAC 173-303-640 as referenced by WAC 173-303-200. 33 For informational purposes, the following is provided for an understanding of the operation of the 34 Leachate Collection Tank. Procedures will be written to manage the leachate in accordance with 35 WAC 173-303-200. The presence of leachate in the tank will be detected with instrumentation within the 36 two stilling wells. The level instrument within the first stilling well monitors the depth of leachate in the 37 tank. A second stilling well will have instrumentation for high-high and low-low alarm set-point trips. 38 The leachate will be removed from the tank using a transfer pump. 39 4.3 Landfills 40 The following addresses the IDF lined landfill. 41 4.3.1 List of Wastes 42 IDF will receive mixed and/or dangerous waste. 43 Waste will be accepted in containers (e.g. drums, boxes, larger containers). 44 Waste streams acceptable at the IDF facility fall within the range of dangerous waste numbers identified 45 in Chapter 1.0, Part A Form.

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4.3.2 Liner System Exemption Requests 2 This permit documentation does not seek an exemption to liner system requirements. 3 4.3.3 Liner System, General Items 4 This section provides a general description of the liner system to be used for the IDF lined landfill. 5 The liner system was designed to prevent migration of leachate out of the lined landfill during the active 6 life of the landfill. The Active Life will consist of the operational period and the closure/postclosure 7 period. The liner system was designed to meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 8 requirements, as identified in RCRA Subtitle C requirements for hazardous waste disposal facilities 9 (40 CFR 264), technical guidance documents (e.g., EPA 1985), and WAC-173-303-665. In addition, the 10 liner system incorporates the following general functional requirements: 11 * Range of Operating Conditions--year-round operation, withstand construction, and long-term 12 stresses. 13 * Degree of Reliability--function safely and effectively throughout operating and 14 closure/postclosure period with minimum maintenance. 15 * Intended Life--operational phase plus closure/postclosure monitoring phase. 16 4.3.3.1 Liner System Description 17 The landfill liner system will comply with WAC 173-303-665 requirements for dangerous waste landfills. 18 Figure 4.2 shows a typical design and includes the following components (from top to bottom). 19 * Operations layer: minimum 0.9-meter thick of native soil. This layer provides a working surface 20 for equipment, protect the liner from mechanical damage, and prevent freezing of the underlying 21 low-hydraulic conductivity soil layer. (Hydraulic conductivity is a measure of how rapidly a 22 material can transmit water and is based on specific ASTM testing requirements.) 23 * Leachate collection and removal system (LCRS) contains a minimum 0.3-meter-thick drainage 24 gravel layer with a hydraulic conductivity of at least 1 x 10-2 centimeter per second (sometimes 25 including perforated drainage pipes). A nonwoven separation geotextile is located between the 26 operations layer and the drainage gravel layer to minimize sediment (fine-soil) migration into the 27 LCRS. A nonwoven cushion geotextile is located between the drainage gravel and the primary 28 geomembrane to protect the primary geomembrane. 29 The LCRS liners collect and convey leachate to the LCRS sump for removal and include the following 30 components. 31 * Primary geomembrane liner: this liner consists of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) because of 32 its excellent resistance to expected chemicals (Chapter 1.0), nominal 60-mil thickness (54-mil 33 minimum), which is textured (to improve stability against sliding). The geomembrane acts as a 34 moisture barrier. Located immediately above the primary geomembrane the LCRS includes a 35 perforated pipe that helps collect and guide water into the leachate collection sump. The 36 perforated pipe is located along the centerline of the cell and provides high-flow path water to the 37 primary collection sump. 38 * Primary geosynthetic clay liner (GCL): the GCL consisting of a high-swelling sodium synthetic 39 mat containing bentonite with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 x 10' centimeter per second or less. 40 This layer acts as an additional primary moisture barrier directly under the primary 41 geomembrane. 42 The leak detection system (LDS) is similar to the LCRS except the composite drainage net (CDN) 43 replaces the primary gravel layer, the geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) is placed directly under the secondary 44 geomembrane liner only under the LDS sump and the perforated pipes are not be needed because very 45 high flow capacities are not be required. Chapter 4.7

--- Page 66 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I The purpose of this system is to collect any leachate that leaks through the primary liner system and 2 convey the leachate to the LDS sump for removal. The LDS also serves as a secondary LCRS. The LDS 3 liners will collect and convey leakage to the LDS sump and include the following components: 4 * Secondary geomembrane liner: same as primary geomembrane liner. 5 * Secondary geosynthetic clay liner: same as primary geosynthetic clay liner. 6 * Admix liner: a minimum 0.9-meter-thick layer of compacted soil/bentonite admixture with a 7 hydraulic conductivity of 1 x 10-7 centimeter per second or less. The bentonite is high-swelling 8 sodium bentonite. This layer acts as an additional moisture barrier directly under the secondary 9 geosynthetic clay liner in the LDS sump area and the secondary geomembrane outside the LDS 10 sump area. 11 * The secondary leak detection system (SLDS) consists of operations layer type fill for a 12 foundation of the LDS admix layer, drainage gravel with a hydraulic conductivity of at least I x 13 10-2 centimeter per second adjacent to a perforated pipe, a composite drainage net (CDN) and 14 tertiary geomembrane. A nonwoven separation geotextile is located between the operations layer 15 type material and the drainage gravel to minimize sediment (fine-soil) migration into the SLDS 16 piping. The purpose of this system is to provide access to the area immediately below the LDS 17 sump area. The SLDS collects liquids resulting from construction water and potentially, liquid 18 from other sources. The SLDS liners will convey collected liquids to the SLDS piping for 19 monitoring and/or removal. (Note that the secondary leak detection system is not a design 20 requirement of WAC 173-303-665, however DOE is adding the design feature pursuant to its 21 authority under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) and not for the purposes of compliance 22 with the dangerous waste regulations. Therefore, information regarding the design, construction, 23 and operation of the secondary leak detection system is provided in this application as 24 information only. Pursuant to AEA, DOE has sole and exclusive responsibility and authority to 25 regulate the source, special nuclear and by-product material component of radioactive mixed 26 waste at DOE-owned nuclear facilities. Source, special nuclear and by-product materials, as 27 defined by AEA, are not subject to regulation under RCRA or the Hazardous Waste Management 28 Act, by the State of Washington and are not be subject to State dangerous waste permit, orders, or 29 any other enforceable instrument issued there under. DOE recognizes that radionuclide data may 30 be useful in the development and confirmation of geohydrologic conceptual models. 31 Radionuclide data contained herein is therefore provided as a matter of comity so the information 32 may be used for such purposes). 33 4.3.3.1.1 Operations Layer 34 The purpose of the operations layer is to protect the underlying liner components from damage by 35 equipment during lined landfill construction and operation. This layer also protects the admix layer from 36 freezing and desiccation cracking. 37 Previous research and experience has shown that desiccation cracks can occur under geomembrane liners 38 when either the liner is not in close contact with the compacted admix or when the liner is subjected to 39 wide temperature fluctuations (Corser and Cranston 1991). The operations layer acts as a weight to keep 40 the geomembrane in contact with the admix, thereby reducing the potential for water vapor to form in an 41 underlying airspace. The operations layer also acts as an insulating layer, together with the dead air space 42 trapped in the underlying drainage layers. 43 The operations layer material typically consists of onsite granular soil that is reasonably well graded. The 44 material has a maximum particle size limit of 5.1 centimeters or less, to facilitate protection of the 45 underlying layers. 46 4.3.3.1.2 Leachate Collection and Removal System 47 The LCRS is located below the operations layer and provides a flow path for the leachate flowing into the 48 LCRS sump. Chapter 4.8

--- Page 67 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Between the operations layer and the underlying drainage gravel, a geotextile layer functions as a filter 2 separation barrier. The geotextile prevents migration of fine soil and clogging of the drainage gravel. On 3 the lined landfill floor the drain gravel is a minimum 0.3-meter-thick layer of washed, rounded to 4 subrounded stone, with a hydraulic conductivity of at least I x 10-2 centimeter per second. In addition, a 5 perforated high-density polyethylene drainage pipe placed within the drainage gravel accelerates leachate 6 transport into the LCRS sump during high precipitation events. On the lined landfill floor, the drain 7 gravel layer is underlain by a geotextile cushion resting on the primary high-density polyethylene 8 geomembrane. The geotextile provides additional protection for the primary geomembrane on the floor 9 of the landfill. 10 On the lined landfill sideslopes, the LCRS has a composite drainage net (CDN) layer composed of a 11 geonet (which is a network of HDPE strands, interwoven and bonded to form a panel that provides a 12 drainage pathway for fluids), with a layer of geotextile thermally bonded to each side. This CDN layer 13 has a transmissivity of at least 3 x 10-' meters squared per second. The CDN is used on the sideslopes to 14 avoid problems associated with placement of clean granular material on slopes, thereby minimizing the 15 potential for damaging the underlying liner system. 16 4.3.3.1.3 Primary Geomembrane Liner 17 The primary geomembrane liner acts both as an impermeable leachate barrier and as a flow surface, 18 routing leachate to the primary sump. High-density polyethylene was used because of its high resistance 19 to chemical deterioration. Generally, textured (roughened) geomembrane is used to maximize shear 20 strength along adjacent interfaces and to reduce the potential for sliding of the liner system. 21 4.3.3.1.4 Primary Geosynthetic Clay Liner Layer 22 A primary geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) consists of a mat of bentonite placed between two geotextiles. 23 The GCL is installed immediately beneath the primary high-density polyethylene liner on the floor of the 24 lined landfill only. The purpose of this liner is to provide extra protection in the case of deterioration 25 (such as stress cracking) of the primary geomembrane where operations will continue for several years. 26 The.in-place hydraulic conductivity of the GCL is I x 10-' centimeter per second or less, exceeding the 27 WAC hydraulic conductivity requirement for the secondary soil liners. The upper surface of GCL 28 provides a smooth uniform surface on which to place the overlying geomembrane liner. 29 4.3.3.1.5 Leak Detection System 30 The LDS provides the flow path for leachate flowing into the LDS sump. The following is a description 31 of the system to be used in the IDF landfill. 32 The LDS has a CDN drainage layer on the floor, and a CDN drainage layer on the sideslopes. The CDN 33 consist of a layer of geotextile thermally bonded to each side of the geonet. These materials and their 34 configuration is similar to the LCRS described in Section 4.3.3.1.2, except for the absence of a drainage 35 gravel layer and a perforated drainage pipe system on the floor of the lined landfill. The LDS will 36 channel leachate that penetrates the primary liner system through the CDN into the leak detection sump. 37 The LDS serves as a secondary LCRS for the IDF. Leachate collected in the secondary sump will be 38 measured to determine the leakage rate through the primary liner. 39 4.3.3.1.6 Secondary and Tertiary Geomembrane Liner 40 The secondary geomembrane liner, located underneath the LDS, is placed directly against the secondary 41 compacted admix liner, except in the LDS sump area which includes a geosynthetic clay liner between 42 the secondary geomembrane liner and the secondary compacted admix liner. For information only, the 43 teriary geomembrane liner for the SLDS is placed directly against subgrade as per Section 4.3.3.1.8. The 44 secondary and teriary geomembrane liners are similar to the primary geomembrane described in 45 Section 4.3.3.1.3. The secondary geosynthetic clay liner material is similar to the primary geosynthetic 46 clay liner described in Section 4.3.3.1.4. Chapter 4.9

--- Page 68 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4.3.3.1.7 Secondary Admix Liner 2 The secondary admix liner has a minimum 0.9-meter-thick compacted soil/bentonite admixture located 3 immediately beneath the secondary high-density polyethylene liner, as required by WAC 173-303-665. 4 The secondary admix liner typically consists of silty sand from local borrow sources mixed with a 5 nominal 12 percent sodium bentonite, by dry weight. The in-place hydraulic conductivity of the admix 6 liner is 1 x 10' centimeter per second or less, consistent with WAC requirements for secondary soil 7 liners. The upper surface of the secondary admix liner is trimmed to the design grades and tolerances. 8 The surface was rolled with a smooth steel-drum roller to remove all ridges and irregularities. The result 9 is a smooth uniform surface on which to place the overlying geomembrane liner. 10 4.3.3.1.8 Subgrade/Liner System Foundation 11 The lined landfill in the IDF is founded in undisturbed native soils or material compacted to at least 95% 12 of a standard proctor maximum density (determined by ASTM D698). The liner system foundation is 13 discussed in further detail in Section 4.3.4. 14 4.3.3.1.9 Access Ramp 15 The lined landfill has an access ramp outside the lined portion of the landfill, minimizing damage to the 16 liner system from vehicle traffic into the lined landfill. As the landfill expands the access ramp will be 17 reconstructed to the south of each expansion in the landfill. The access ramp design could vary as the 18 landfill expands. 19 4.3.3.1.10 Landfill Expansion 20 The initial phase of the IDF liner was complete at the north end of the landfill. As shown in Figure 4.1, 21 construction of the initial IDF phase completed the liner system on the north sideslope and the excavated 22 portions of the landfill floor, east sideslope, and west sideslope. The dashed line of Figure 4.1 across the 23 south edge of the landfill floor denotes the southern extent of the landfill liner. The liner system will be 24 installed to extend approximately 15 meters beyond the estimated toe of slope of the first phase waste 25 placement. This extension will also allow waste haul vehicles to be staged or unloaded over a lined area. 26 Termination detail for the south edge of the liner system is found in Appendix 4A, drawing H-2-830840. 27 The south sideslope of the first phase of IDF is not lined to allow future expansion of the IDF. At the 28 south end of the cells is a storm water berm/ditch with an infiltration area, which will capture clean runoff 29 from the unlined south sideslope before it runs onto the lined landfill. The landfill floor slopes up 1% 30 from north to south to allow adequate leachate collection capacity for a 25-year storm event. Each future 31 liner construction project will connect to the south edge of the previously constructed liner and operations 32 systems and extend the disposal area further to the south. With the expansion of the IDF in subsequent 33 phases, access ramps for the previous phase will be destroyed and new ramps built on the south edge of 34 the landfill. 35 4.3.3.2 Liner System Location Relative to High Water Table 36 The water table is located approximately 90 to 100 meters below the ground surface in the IDF. It is 37 anticipated that the deepest point of the liner system is no greater than 20 meters below ground surface. 38 Consequently, the liner systems is at least 69 meters above groundwater. The liner systems will not be 39 affected by the water table because of this large elevational difference. 40 4.3.3.3 Loads on Liner System 41 The liner system experiences several types of stresses during construction, operation, and 42 closure/postclosure periods. The following sections discuss the types of stress and analytical methods 43 used to design the IDF liners. 44 4.3.3.3.1 Liner Stress 45 The geosynthetic liner components experience some stress particularly during installation and before 46 placing waste in the lined landfill but also during the entire lifecycle. Chapter 4.10

--- Page 69 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The high-density polyethylene liner is temperature sensitive, expanding, and contracting as liner 2 temperatures increase and decrease. Thermally induced stresses could develop in the liner if deployment 3 and anchoring occur just before a significant decrease in the liner temperature. The operations layer is 4 sufficiently thick to ensure liner stress remains below the yield strain and stress. Administrative 5 procedures will prevent loading and backfilling of waste exceeding applicable thermal limits due to recent 6 vitrification processes to avoid potential liner damage. 7 The drainage gravel has the potential to produce localized stress on the geomembrane liner during gravel 8 placement with construction equipment. The geotextile cushion placed at the base of the drainage gravel 9 protects the underlying geomembrane. A puncture analysis was performed to select a sufficiently thick 10 cushion geotextile. This analysis incorporated expected construction vehicle ground pressures and design 11 drainage gravel gradation listed in the construction specifications. If required, engineering controls such 12 as independent foundations will be installed to minimize liner stress involved with large package disposal. 13 On the landfill sideslopes, tension induced by liner-component load transfer is not anticipated, because 14 the liner interface effective shear strength angles are higher than the sideslope angles. The liner 15 component interface strengths were determined by laboratory direct shear tests. Both static and dynamic 16 stability analyses were performed, using standard methods, design accelerations, and factors of safety. 17 Stress on the geomembrane in the anchor trench also was evaluated during detailed design. Wind uplift 18 and thermal expansion and contraction could cause stress in the geomembrane during construction. 19 However, these stresses are not be a problem, because the stress is relatively low as compared to the 20 tensile strength of the liner. In addition, these stresses are minimized by using sand bags to control liner 21 position during liner panel placement and welding, as well as keeping the anchor trench open until the 22 liner is stabilized with overlaying fill material. Placement of overlaying fill material is controlled to limit 23 stress buildup in the liner. The stress is not present after construction, because of the weight and 24 insulating properties of the operations layer. 25 4.3.3.3.2 Stress Resulting From Operating Equipment 26 Operations equipment provides a design load case on the IDF liner, which was analyzed as part of the 27 IDF design (Appendix 4A). The analyses show that the 0.9-meter-thick operations layer dissipates stress 28 produced by the operating equipment and is sufficient to protect the IDF liner system. 29 4.3.3.3.3 Stress from Maximum Quantity of Waste, Cover, and Proposed 30 Closure/Postclosure Land Use 31 When the lined landfill is full and the cover system is in place, the liner system will experience a static 32 load from the overlying waste, backfill, and cover materials. No significant increase in stresses on the 33 liner system is anticipated from closure/postclosure land use. The maximum design load of material 34 overlying the liner system includes an allowance for the cover system. Analyses include puncture 35 protection of the geomembrane by the cushion geotextile, and decrease in transmissivity of CDN drainage 36 layers. Materials were specified based on the ability of the materials to perform adequately under 37 closure/postclosure loading conditions. 38 Dynamic stress on the liner system will result primarily from ground accelerations during seismic events. 39 Both static and dynamic analyses were performed on the subgrade and liner components based on the 40 finished configuration of the empty landfill. Under closure/postclosure conditions, the waste, backfill, 41 and cover materials will tend to buttress the liner system, resulting in greater stability relative to the 42 operational phase. All of the analyses verified adequate stability for the IDF. 43 4.3.3.3.4 Stresses Resulting From Settlement, Subsidence, or Uplift 44 The subgrade settlement produced by waste loading essentially will be elastic because of the 45 coarse-grained, noncohesive, and drained nature of the soil. The subgrade rebounded during the 46 excavation phase of construction and will settle as the landfill is filled. The compacted admix liner will 47 consolidate under waste loads. The total settlement will be a combination of the subgrade elastic and the 48 admix consolidation settlements. Chapter 4.11

--- Page 70 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I These settlements were analyzed with standard methods during detailed design of the lined landfill. In 2 general, differential settlements will be expected to occur primarily across the lined landfill sideslopes as 3 the thickness of waste decreases from maximum to zero. The geosynthetic liner components were 4 analyzed, the anticipated strains likely will not produce any appreciable stresses in the liner system. 5 The potential for subsidence-induced stress is believed to be negligible based on the following 6 information: 7 * The soils underlying the IDF tend to be coarse-grained soils, sands, and gravels, in a relatively 8 dense configuration that will not be subject to piping effects that could transport soil resulting in 9 subsidence. 10 * The groundwater level is deep, at least 69.6 meters below the base of the lined landfill, and will 11 not affect bearing soils. 12 * No natural voids, or man-made mining or tunneling has been noted. If the groundwater level was 13 lowered substantially and consolidation occurred in the aquifer, local site-specific subsidence 14 would be negligible because of the depth of the groundwater below the lined landfill. 15 The potential for stresses resulting from uplift on the liner system also is expected to be negligible. The 16 seasonal groundwater level is very deep, and higher-elevation perched groundwater likely will not 17 develop because of the absence of aquitards in the coarse-grained Hanford formation underlying the IDF. 18 The coarse-grained nature of the Hanford formation also promotes rapid, primarily vertical, infiltration, 19 which means it is unlikely that infiltration from outside the lined landfill boundary would be transported 20 laterally underneath the landfill liner. Gas pressures similarly are unlikely to develop because of the 21 absence of any organic material that could generate significant subsurface gas (from organic material 22 decomposition) and the coarse-grained, highly permeable sands and gravels underlying the landfill. 23 4.3.3.3.5 Internal and External Pressure Gradients 24 Pressure gradients across the liner caused by liquids or gases will be expected to be negligible. Internal 25 pressures due to liquids will be controlled by the leachate collection and removal system. Because 26 leachate will be removed from the flat 50-foot by 50-foot LCRS sump in a timely manner, there will be 27 minimal liquid head on the liner (less than 30.5 centimeters according to WAC regulations). Gas 28 generated internally is expected to be minimal because waste is inorganic and non-reactive. However, 29 any pre-closure internally generated gas will be vented through either the waste or the leachate collection 30 system. The closure cover design will consider gas venting. 31 External pressures on the liner system is expected to be minimal. Gas pressures will be negligible 32 because the subgrade soil contains no gas producing materials and is highly permeable, readily venting 33 any potential gas to the atmosphere. External pressure from liquids is not anticipated because of the deep 34 groundwater table and the highly permeable foundation soils. 35 4.3.3.4 Liner System Coverage 36 The liner system covers all soils underlying the lined landfill and extends over the crest of the sideslopes 37 into the anchor trench (Figure 4.2, Detail 3). 38 4.3.3.5 Liner System Exposure Prevention 39 No geosynthetic or admix components of the liner system are exposed to the atmosphere. The minimum 40 0.9-meter-thick operations layer covers the entire lined landfill surface. This layer serves both as a 41 physical protective barrier and as thermal insulation, protecting the admix layer from desiccation and frost 42 damage. 43 Excessive erosion, such as gullying, will be repaired by replacing the eroded soil. Dust suppression 44 agents will be used to prevent excessive wind erosion on the landfill sideslopes. The dust suppression 45 agents will bind the surface of the operations layer and will minimize wind entrainment of soil. Chapter 4.12

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4.3.4 Liner System, Foundation 2 The following sections discuss the foundations beneath the liner systems. 3 4.3.4.1 Foundation Description 4 At the IDF, the Hanford formation consists mainly of sand dominated facies with lesser amounts of silt 5 dominated and gravel dominated facies. Where sands are present, these sands are underlain by the 6 Hanford formation. Here, the Hanford formation has been described as poorly sorted pebble to boulder 7 gravel and fine to course grained sand, with lesser amounts of interstitial and interbedded silt and clay. 8 The two geologic units pertinent to the IDF lined landfill are summarized as follows. 9 Recent eolian sand: The sand is light olive gray in color and has a density that is loose at the surface but 10 becomes compact with depth. The sand has a fine to medium grain size and includes little to some 11 nonplastic silt-sized fines. The deposit is homogeneous except for a distinguishable layer of volcanic ash 12 in some locations. 13 Glaciofluvial flood deposit: This deposit has well graded mixtures of sands and gravels with trace to little 14 nonplastic silt-sized particles. The gravel content can vary with depth, and the deposit can become 15 predominantly gravel. This coarse-grained deposit is part of the Cold Creek Bar, which was formed 16 during the Pleistocene Epoch by glacial outburst flooding. 17 4.3.4.2 Subsurface Exploration Data 18 Geological site investigations were used to support the detailed design of the landfill. The investigations 19 consisted of a review of historical data, including well logs (Chapter 5.0), exploratory borings, and 20 surface pit samples data. Because the foundation soils are relatively consistent over broad areas, the need 21 for additional borings and geophysical investigations will be determined on a case-by-case basis. If 22 boreholes are drilled, penetration test data will be collected to determine the strength of the foundation 23 materials in situ. 24 4.3.4.3 Laboratory Testing Data 25 Laboratory testing will be performed on the surface soil samples and borings, both from the lined landfill 26 site and from potential borrow source locations as follows. Testing will be performed to classify soils, 27 provide input parameters to verify engineering analyses, and for preparing material and construction 28 specifications. The following tests will be performed on the soil samples: 29 * Visual classification (ASTM D2487)--to classify soils 30 * Natural moisture content (ASTM D2216)--for input to engineering analyses and preparing 31 construction specifications 32 * Particle size analysis (ASTM D422 or D1 140/C136)--for classification and input to engineering 33 analyses 34 * Moisture-density relationships (ASTM D698 or D1557)--for preparing compaction specifications 35 Laboratory testing will be performed according to the most recent versions of ASTM methods or other 36 recognized standards. Additional tests will be performed as needed. 37 4.3.4.4 Engineering Analyses 38 The subgrade will be required to support the liner system and overlying materials (waste, fill, and cover) 39 without excessive settlement, compression, or uplift that could damage the liner system. This section 40 describes the design approach used to satisfy these criteria. 41 4.3.4.4.1 Settlement Potential 42 The subgrade settlement produced by waste loading essentially will be elastic because of the 43 coarse-grained, noncohesive, and drained nature of the soil. The subgrade will rebound during the 44 excavation phase of construction and will settle as the landfill is filled. Chapter 4.13

--- Page 72 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I An elastic settlement analysis using standard methods was performed and results indicate the magnitude 2 of the total and differential settlement is within performance limits. 3 4.3.4.4.2 Bearing Capacity 4 The bearing capacity of the subgrade soil will need to support structures such as leachate collection tanks. 5 The construction specifications typically will require that the upper portion of the subgrade soil and all 6 structural fill be moisture conditioned and compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum standard 7 Proctor dry density (ASTM D698). Maximum allowable bearing capacities for foundations have been 8 established using standard geotechnical methods. Bearing capacities for the types of soils expected at the 9 IDF typically are greater than the maximum expected loads from the support structures. 10 4.3.4.4.3 Stability of Lined Landfill Slopes 11 The lined landfill was constructed in eolian sand and the underlying coarse-grained Hanford formation. 12 In granular, cohesionless, and drained soils such as these, the stability of the slope will be related 13 primarily to the maximum slope angle. Both veneer and global stability analyses were performed to 14 determine both static and dynamic sideslope stability. Results demonstrate adequate stability for the IDF 15 throughout its design life. 16 4.3.4.4.4 Potential for Excess Hydrostatic or Gas Pressures 17 Because the seasonal high-water level is at least 69 meters below the base of the deepest lined landfill, no 18 external hydrostatic pressure will be expected from this source. Because of the coarse-grained nature of 19 the foundation soils, any infiltration of surface water around the perimeter of the lined landfill will be 20 expected to travel primarily downward. Therefore, infiltration should not cause substantial pressure on 21 the exterior of the liner system. Internal hydrostatic pressure from leachate will be negligible because the 22 leachate will be removed from the lined landfill to limit head on the liner. 23 Gas pressure exerted externally on the liner system is expected to be negligible, because no 24 gas-generating material (i.e., organic material) is expected in the foundation soils. If any gas were 25 generated below the liner system, little pressure buildup would occur because of the unsaturated 26 coarse-grained nature of the foundation soils, which would vent the gas to the atmosphere. Internal gas 27 pressure buildup will not be anticipated, because wastes are generally inorganic and have low gas 28 generating potential, and the leachate collection system will be vented to the atmosphere and dissipates 29 any gas. 30 4.3.4.4.5 Seismic Conditions 31 Potential hazards from seismic events will include faulting, slope failure, and liquefaction. Disruption of 32 the lined landfill by faulting is not considered a significant risk because (1) no major faults have been 33 identified at the IDF (DOE/RW-0 164) and (2) only one central fault at Gable Mountain on the Hanford 34 Site shows evidence of movement within the last 13,000 years. The potential for slope failure is 35 considered low, because granular materials typically have high strengths relative to the maximum 36 sideslope angles expected for the lined landfill. Liquefaction will occur in loose, poorly graded granular 37 materials that are subjected to shaking from seismic events. Saturated soils will be most susceptible 38 because of high dynamic pore pressures that temporarily lower the effective stress. During this process, 39 the soil particles will be rearranged into a denser configuration, with a resulting decrease in volume. The 40 foundation materials at the IDF is not considered susceptible to liquefaction because the materials are 41 well graded granular soils that are unsaturated and relatively dense. 42 The IDF support building (not sited within the TSD boundary) will be located in Zone 2B as identified in 43 the Uniform Building Code (ICBO 1997). 44 4.3.4.4.6 Subsidence Potential 45 In general, subsidence of undisturbed foundation materials would be the result of dissolution, fluid 46 extraction (water or petroleum), or mining. The potential for subsidence will be negligible at the IDF 47 based on the following. Chapter 4.14

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * The soils underlying the IDF are coarse-grained sands and gravels, in a relatively dense 2 configuration, which are not subject to piping that can cause transport of soil and resulting 3 subsidence. 4 * The groundwater level is deep, at least 69 meters below the base of the lined landfill, and does not 5 affect bearing soils. 6 * The soil and rock types below the IDF are not soluble. 7 * No mining or tunneling has been noted. If the groundwater level was lowered substantially and 8 consolidation occurred in the aquifer, local site-specific subsidence would be negligible because 9 of the depth of the groundwater table below the lined landfill. 10 4.3.4.4.7 Sinkhole Potential 11 Borings in and around the IDF have not identified any soluble materials in the foundation soils or 12 underlying sediments. Consequently, the potential for any sinkhole development is negligible. 13 4.3.5 Liner System, Liners 14 The following sections discuss the individual components of the IDF liner systems. 15 4.3.5.1 Synthetic Liners 16 As described in Section 4.3.3, the synthetic liners act as an impermeable barrier for leachate migration 17 (Figure 4.2). The synthetic liners consist of high-density polyethylene material that make the liners 18 resistant to chemical deterioration. Section 4.3.3 describes the synthetic liner system in detail. 19 4.3.5.2 Synthetic Liner Compatibility Data 20 During detailed design of the lined landfill, the composition of the expected leachate was estimated. 21 Expected leachate composition was based on known waste composition, process information, leachate 22 from other operating lined landfills, and similar sources of data. Leachate constituents were compared to 23 manufacturers' chemical compatibility data for synthetic liner components. In addition, the results of 24 previous chemical compatibility testing and studies were evaluated against leachate composition. 25 Information gained from this evaluation was used to select a liner that will be compatible with the 26 expected leachate. 27 Compatibility testing for leachate tank liner material is planned for construction. An immersion test 28 program is included in the technical specifications for the tank liner (anticipated to be XR-5 material). 29 The immersion-testing program will require the construction general contractor to submit tank liner 30 samples to the design engineer for immersion testing as part of the submittal and certification process for 31 the tank. Immersion testing will follow EPA 9090A (and ASTM) test protocols. 32 During landfill operation, the compatibility of waste receipts with the liner will be ensured. The 33 compatibility of the waste constituents with the liner material will be established by laboratory testing if 34 determined to be necessary, based on waste type and concentrations. Such tests will follow EPA 35 Method 9090A or other appropriate methods. Test results will be evaluated using statistical methods and 36 accepted criteria (based on past projects and agency acceptance) for liner/leachate compatibility. 37 4.3.5.3 Synthetic Liner Strength 38 As discussed in Section 4.3.3.3, the liner system will experience loads from several sources. During the 39 detailed design process for the landfill, the strength of liner system materials was evaluated against these 40 loads. The analysis indicated an adequate factor of safety for liner system materials. 41 Seams in geomembranes is a critical area; however, correct installation methods make the seams stronger 42 than the surrounding material. Detailed installation and testing requirements will be included in the 43 construction quality assurance plan (Section 4.3.7.3) to ensure that the liner is constructed properly. In 44 addition, methods will be established to demonstrate adequate seam strength is achieved during 45 installation. Chapter 4.15

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Seaming requirements for the geotextiles and CDN: These materials were overlapped sufficiently to 2 provide complete area coverage, and relatively light seams were used to hold the panels in position during 3 construction, seam strength requirements for these materials will be negligible. 4 4.3.5.4 Synthetic Liner Bedding 5 The primary geomembrane liner is in contact with the GCL and geotextile cushion underlying the 6 drainage gravel. 7 The secondary geomembrane liner is in direct contact with the compacted admix layer. This type of 8 subgrade is typical for flexible geomembrane liners. 9 With respect to the drainage gravel and operations layers, the geomembranes are protected by overlying 10 geotextile cushion or CDN layers. These geotextiles were designed to provide adequate protection during 11 construction and operation to withstand the loads discussed in Section 4.3.3.3. 12 4.3.5.5 Soil Liners 13 The IDF landfill is lined with a minimum (0.9-meter thick) layer of compacted soil/bentonite mixture 14 (admix) under the secondary geomembrane liner. This layer has an in-place hydraulic conductivity of 15 less than 1 x 10' centimeter per second. The soil component of the admix is silty fine sand or similar 16 material from areas near the IDF. Approximately 12 percent bentonite by dry weight was added to the 17 fine soil to achieve sufficiently low hydraulic conductivity; however, the percent might vary. 18 4.3.5.5.1 Material Testing Data 19 Laboratory testing will be performed on soil liner materials to confirm input parameters for engineering 20 analyses and for refining material and construction specifications. 21 Before constructing the lined landfill, a full-scale test fill of the admix material will be conducted. The 22 primary purpose of the test fill will be to verify that the specified soil density, moisture content, and 23 hydraulic conductivity values will be achieved consistently using proposed compaction equipment and 24 procedures. In-place density will be measured using both the nuclear gauge (ASTM D2922) and sand 25 cone (ASTM D1556) methods. In-place hydraulic conductivity will be determined from a two-stage 26 infiltration from a borehole (ASTM D6391). Admix hydraulic conductivity will be estimated from 27 thin-wall tube samples (ASTM D1587) obtained from the test fill and tested in the laboratory (ASTM 28 D5084). Details of the test fill are presented in the Construction Quality Assurance Plan (Appendix 4B). 29 During construction, field density (e.g., ASTM D2922, D2167, and/or DI556) and moisture content 30 (ASTM D2216) will be measured periodically. Thin-wall tube samples (ASTM D1587) will be taken at 31 regular intervals and will be tested for hydraulic conductivity (ASTM D5084). Additional details of field- 32 testing during construction will be presented in the Construction Quality Assurance Plan. 33 Dispersion and piping in the admix are not considered likely because the hydraulic conductivity, and thus 34 the flow velocity, will be very low, making it difficult to move the soil particles or otherwise disrupt the 35 soil fabric. In addition, the admix will be well graded, so the component particles will tend to hold each 36 other in place. Therefore, testing for these characteristics will not be necessary. 37 4.3.5.5.2 Soil Liner Compatibility Data 38 As discussed in Section 4.3.5.2, expected leachate composition was determined as part of detailed landfill 39 design. The results of previous chemical compatibility testing and studies were evaluated against leachate 40 composition to determine the effect of leachate on soil liner composition or hydraulic conductivity. The 41 tests followed the procedures of ASTM D5084 (flexible wall parameter) and considered the effects of 42 radiation on the soil liner materials. 43 4.3.5.5.3 Soil Liner Thickness 44 The IDF was designed to operate to minimize the leachate head over the liner systems. Chapter 4.16

--- Page 75 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Design of the primary liner system included an additional clay layer (the primary GCL layer, which was 2 previously described in Section 4.3.3.1) underlying the primary HDPE geomembrane to further minimize 3 liner leakage from the primary liner. Note that only a single geomembrane is required under WAC 173- 4 303 for the primary liner. 5 Calculations evaluated the effectiveness of the primary soil liner as a barrier to leachate. Leakage 6 analyses were performed for the primary liner system using EPA's Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill 7 Performance (HELP) Model (Schroeder et al. 1997). Estimated leakage rates were compared to the 8 Action Leakage Rate (ALR, which is defined in WAC 173-303-665[8] as "the maximum design flow rate 9 that the leak detection system ... can remove without the fluid head on the bottom liner exceeding 10 1 foot"), and were determined to be much lower than the ALR. This demonstrates the benefit of the GCL 11 included in the primary bottom-lining system, which provides a composite lining system and minimizes 12 actual leakage through the bottom primary lining system. 13 Overall, the IDF is designed to actively convey and collect leachate from the liner areas of the facility to 14 minimize leachate buildup over the liners. Leachate is conveyed to the LCRS and LDS sumps for active 15 removal from the facility. In addition, the LCRS sump area has been designed with a 6-inch-deep sump 16 trough where the LCRS pumps are positioned to minimize the area of the sump that has a permanent 17 liquid level (below the pump intake/shutoff elevation). Both the LCRS and LDS sump pumps will be 18 operated throughout the Active Life of the facility and into the post-closure period until leachate 19 generation has essentially ceased. By actively removing leachate from the IDF, head buildup is 20 minimized, which in turn minimizes leakage through both the primary and secondary liner systems. 21 4.3.5.5.4 Soil Liner Strength 22 The expected loads on the liner system are discussed in Section 4.3.3.3. Significant stresses in the soil 23 liner that were considered include (1) stresses from the weight of the liner system, (2) stresses on the 24 interface with the overlying materials, and (3) stresses during construction. 25 Stresses will be present on the sideslopes from the weight of the operations layer and soil liner itself. 26 Using material properties determined from laboratory testing, the stability of the soil liner was evaluated 27 under both static and dynamic loading conditions. Standard methods of slope stability analysis were 28 used. Interface strengths were found to provide adequate veneer stability for the liner system. Interface 29 strength is the shear strength that occurs between layers of liner materials at their interface boundary, as 30 established by ASTM test methods. 31 The primary concern during construction will be bearing failure caused by the weight of overlying soil 32 components of the liner system (e.g., drainage gravel on the floor) and the construction equipment used to 33 spread these materials. Strength parameters developed from laboratory testing and standard analytical 34 methods were again used to determine that adequate stability and bearing capacity exist for the IDF liner 35 system. 36 4.3.5.5.5 Engineering Report 37 An engineering report was prepared for the lined landfill as part of the definitive design document 38 package. The report describes the design of the liner system and includes supporting calculations. 39 The critical systems IDF Design Report is provided in Appendix 4A. The final IDF design report was 40 prepared under the supervision of a professional engineer registered in Washington State. 41 4.3.6 Liner System, Leachate Collection and Removal System 42 The purpose of the leachate collection and removal system is to provide sufficient hydraulic conductivity 43 and storage volume to collect, retain, and dispose of, in a timely manner, fluids falling on or moving 44 through the waste. The primary leachate collection and removal system provides the preferential path 45 along which the leachate flows into the primary sump. The secondary leachate collection and removal 46 system (also called the leak detection system) is located between the primary and secondary 47 geomembranes. The secondary leachate collection and removal system provides the preferential path 48 along which any fluids leaking through the primary liner system flow to the secondary sump. Chapter 4.17

--- Page 76 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The collected leachate will be pumped to a leachate collection tank, screened and/or sampled, and 2 transferred to a permitted treatment and disposal unit. 3 4.3.6.1 System Operation and Design 4 The lined landfill operates in a way that ensures the bottom liner is maintained as dry as possible, and the 5 head on the top liner does not exceed 30.5 centimeters measured above the flat 50-foot-by-50-foot LCRS 6 sump HDPE liner. In extreme conditions (i.e., in excess of a 25-year storm event), the head on the top 7 liner could exceed 30.5 centimeters for short durations. The operating methodology, described in the 8 following paragraphs, ensures that liquids on the bottom liner are removed continuously before liquids 9 could accumulate and exceed 30.5 centimeters for the design storm event. 10 Both leachate collection systems operate either manually or automatically. When operated automatically, 11 liquid level sensors will cycle the pumps on and off, in response to rising and falling leachate levels. The 12 leakage rate through the top liner will be calculated to demonstrate that the leakage rate is less than the 13 'action leakage rate'. Data to support the leakage rate calculations will be obtained either from the flow 14 totalizer in the secondary leachate collection pump discharge line or from the liquid level gauges. 15 Collected leachate from the secondary leachate collection system is pumped to the leachate collection 16 tank. 17 The design of the primary and secondary leachate collection systems is described in Section 4.3.3.1. 18 System geometry was completed and material specifications were developed during the detailed design 19 process. The leachate collection and removal system design will comply with WAC 173-303 20 requirements and applicable guidance. 21 Each sump has a thick layer of gravel designed to provide high hydraulic conductivity and storage 22 capacity. Leachate is removed from the sumps by a pump installed in sideslope riser pipes. Pressure 23 transducers monitor leachate level in the sumps and provide appropriate signals to the pump control 24 system. All pumps and transducers are removable for maintenance, calibration, and related activities. 25 4.3.6.1.1 Primary System 26 The base of the leachate collection and removal system is defined by the primary geomembrane. On the 27 floor of the lined landfill, the primary geomembrane is overlain by geotextile cushion, and the granular 28 drainage layer. The granular drainage layer drains to the primary sump and a perforated pipe is located 29 along the centerline of the cell to increase flow capacity to the primary sump. Geotextile layers at the top 30 of the leachate collection and removal system prevent migration of fine soil particles into the gravel or 31 geonet, thus prevent clogging. On the sideslopes, a CDN layer is over the geomembrane. The CDN 32 includes bonded geotextiles on both sides of a geonet that increase the interface shear strength. Because 33 of construction difficulties in placing a 30.5-cm thick gravel layer on 3:1 sideslopes, no drainage gravel 34 was placed on the sideslopes. 35 The leachate collection and removal system is covered by the operations layer. The layer is a minimum 36 0.9-meter thick, and provides protection for the underlying liner and drainage materials. The operations 37 layer covers both the landfill floor and the sideslopes. 38 The leachate collection and removal system was designed to accommodate the 25-year, 24-hour storm, as 39 required by WAC regulations. However, the EPA recognizes the need to store temporarily leachate from 40 such rare events (EPA 1985). Should a storm event that exceeds the 25-year, 24-hour storm event occur, 41 the leachate collection and removal system sump was designed to store temporarily leachate at a depth 42 greater than 30.5 centimeters, as opposed to the alternative of constructing an excessively large leachate 43 collection tank. 44 The leachate collection and removal system sump is equipped with two sump pumps. One pump is a high 45 capacity pump capable of rapid removal of large volumes of leachate, and is suitable for the transfer of 46 batch quantities of leachate, and can handle the larger volumes of leachate anticipated from the 25-year, 47 24-hour storm event. The other pump is a low-capacity submersible pump located in the base of the 48 sump. The sump pumps are located in a sump trough. Chapter 4.18

--- Page 77 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The sump trough was designed to contain the leachate below the intake of these pumps, within the 2 smallest possible area, to minimize the residual leachate volume after each pumping cycle. The pumps 3 are fabricated from stainless steel or other corrosion resistant material. 4 4.3.6.1.2 Leak Detection System 5 The base of the LDS is formed by the secondary geomembrane. The leak detection system is similar to 6 the LCRS, except that the perforated collection pipe is not included. The perforated pipe is not be needed 7 because high flow capacity is not required for the low leachate volumes. 8 The LDS drains to the LDS sump, which is located immediately below the LCRS sump. Because of the 9 low volumes, the LDS is equipped with only one low-capacity submersible pump to meet 10 WAC 173-303-665(8)(a). 11 4.3.6.1.3 Response Action Plan 12 In compliance with regulatory requirements, a response action plan (Appendix 4C) was prepared for the 13 lined landfill. In accordance with EPA guidance, the action leakage rate was calculated as "the maximum 14 design flow rate that the leak detection system can remove without the fluid head on the bottom liner 15 exceeding 30.5 centimeters" (EPA 1992). If the action leakage rate were exceeded, DOE will do the 16 following: 17 * Notify the appropriate regulatory authority in writing of the exceedence within 7 days of the 18 determination. 19 * Submit a preliminary written assessment to the appropriate regulatory authority within 14 days of 20 the determination, on the amount of liquids, likely sources of liquids, possible location, size, 21 cause of any leaks, and short-term actions taken and planned. 22 * Determine to the extent practicable the location, size, and cause of any leak. 23 * Determine whether waste receipt should cease or be curtailed, whether any waste should be 24 removed from the unit for inspection, repairs, or controls, and whether the unit should be closed. 25 * Determine any other short-term and/or long-term actions to be taken to mitigate or stop any leaks. 26 * Within 30 days after the notification that the action leakage rate has been exceeded, submit to the 27 appropriate regulatory authority the results of the analyses specified in the following paragraphs, 28 the results of actions taken, and actions planned. Monthly thereafter, as long as the flow rate in 29 the leak detection system exceeds the action leakage rate, DOE will submit to the appropriate 30 regulatory authority, a report summarizing the results of any remedial actions taken and actions 31 planned. 32 The leachate will be analyzed for RCRA constituents as appropriate. A procedure will be in place to 33 address details of analysis (i.e., analyses, constituents, test methods, etc.). If the analytical results on 34 leakage fluids indicate that these constituents are present, and if the constituents can be traced to a 35 particular type of waste placed in a known area of the lined landfill, it might be possible to estimate the 36 location of the leak. In addition, waste packages might not undergo enough deterioration during the 37 active life of the landfill to permit escape of the contents; the leachate might be clean or the composition 38 too general to show a specific source location. 39 If the source location cannot be identified, large-scale removal of the waste and operations layer to find 40 and repair the leaking area of the liner would be one option for remediation. However, this risks 41 damaging the liner. In addition, waste would have to be handled, stored, and replaced in the landfill. 42 Backfill would need to be removed from around any waste packages to accomplish this. If the waste 43 packages were damaged during this process, the risk of accidental release might be high. For these 44 reasons, large-scale removal of waste and liner system materials will not be a desirable option and will 45 not be implemented except as a last resort. Chapter 4.19

--- Page 78 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I The preferred alternative will depend on factors such as the amount of waste already in the landfill, the 2 rate of waste receipt, the chemistry of the leachate (i.e., is it clean?), the availability of other disposal 3 units, and similar considerations. Therefore, no single approach will be selected at this time. If 4 necessary, an interim solution could be implemented while the evaluation and permanent remediation 5 were performed. Examples of potential approaches include the following. 6 * The surface of the waste could be graded to direct run-off into a shallow pond. The surface 7 would be covered with the low-hydraulic conductivity layer (geomembrane). Precipitation would 8 be pumped or evaporated from the pond and would not infiltrate the waste already in the lined 9 landfill. Waste would be placed only during periods of dry weather, and stored at other onsite 10 TSD units at other times. This type of approach also could be used to reduce leakage 11 immediately after the action leakage rate was exceeded, while other remediation options were 12 evaluated. 13 * Partial construction of the final closure cover could begin earlier than planned. This would 14 reduce infiltration into the lined landfill, and possibly reduce the leakage rate if the cover were 15 constructed over the failed area. 16 * A layer of low-hydraulic conductivity soil could be placed over the existing waste, perhaps in 17 conjunction with a geomembrane, to create a second 'primary' liner higher in the lined landfill. 18 This new liner would intercept precipitation and allow its removal. 19 * A rigid-frame or air-supported structure could be constructed over the landfill to ensure that no 20 infiltration occurs. Although costly, this approach could be less expensive than constructing a 21 new landfill. 22 In general, the selected remediation efforts will be progressive. Those remediation methods that are 23 judged the least difficult and the most cost effective will be used first. If these efforts are not effective, 24 more difficult or expensive options would be used. 25 4.3.6.2 Equivalent Capacity 26 The CDN drainage layers used will be available commercially and will have equivalent flow capacity to a 27 30.5-centimeters layer of granular drainage material with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 x 10-2 centimeter 28 per second. 29 4.3.6.3 Grading and Drainage 30 In accordance with EPA guidance, all areas of the lined landfill floor (except the sump bottoms) are 31 graded at a slope of at least 2 percent towards the centerline of each cell. The centerline of each cell has a 32 1 percent slope lengthwise towards the sump, to facilitate drainage and avoid ponding on the liners. 33 Grading tolerances have been established to ensure proper slope is maintained. 34 4.3.6.4 Maximum Leachate Head 35 The maximum head on the primary liner is less than 30.5 centimeters, except for rare storm events as 36 discussed in Section 4.3.6.1 and the LCRS sump trough. The sump was sized and designed to provide 37 adequate surge storage to prevent leachate build up on the primary liner. 38 4.3.6.5 System Compatibility 39 The primary and secondary leachate collection and removal systems is composed of inert geologic 40 materials (sand and gravel), high-density polyethylene, and other geosynthetic materials such as 41 polypropylene. As described in Section 4.3.5.2, the geosynthetics were evaluated for compatibility with 42 the expected leachate. To ensure that the geosynthetics used in the lined landfill are similar chemically to 43 those evaluated, manufacturers will be required to submit quality control certificates and other 44 manufacturing information on all materials. 45 Chapter 4.20

--- Page 79 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Before a new waste constituent, not previously analyzed (based on a dangerous waste number), is allowed 2 in the lined landfill, the waste constituent will be evaluated for compatibility with the liner (e.g., identified 3 in 9090A test results or other appropriate testing methods, etc.). Other materials could contact the 4 leachate, for example: 5 * HDPE and Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping will be used. 6 * Polyvinyl chloride and other plastics in miscellaneous uses. 7 * Leachate tank will use a chemically resistant flexible geomembrane liner system. 8 Compatibility of these materials with the expected leachate was considered in the landfill liner system 9 design. Compatibility of these materials will be of lesser concern, because items that consist of these 10 materials will be located entirely within the containment area. Failure of these items would not result in a 11 dangerous waste release, and the materials would be replaced or repaired. 12 4.3.6.6 System Strength 13 Stability of drainage layer, strength of piping, and prevention of clogging are discussed in the following 14 sections. 15 4.3.6.6.1 Stability of Drainage Layers 16 As described in Sections 4.3.3.3 and 4.3.5.3, the stability of the liners and leachate collection and removal 17 systems on the sideslopes was evaluated as part of detailed design (Appendix 4A). To provide 18 sufficiently high shear strengths at the interfaces between geosynthetic components, textured 19 geomembranes and thermally bonded CDNs are used. 20 Bearing capacity of the drainage and sump gravels is expected to be adequate, based on typical strength 21 values for granular materials. 22 The transmissivity of the drainage layers under the combined load of the waste and cover was addressed 23 in the design and will be adequate to support leachate removal. 24 4.3.6.6.2 Strength of Piping 25 The drainpipes in the primary drainage and sump gravel and sideslope riser pipes are high-density 26 polyethylene pipe. During detailed design, the required wall thickness of the pipe was determined 27 according to the manufacturer's recommendations and standard analytical methods used by the piping 28 industry (Appendix 4A). In these analyses, the ultimate load (derived from the estimated weight of the 29 waste and cover) was used, the allowable deflections were limited to 5 percent, and conservative values 30 for soil modulus and lateral confinement were assumed. 31 4.3.6.7 Prevention of Clogging 32 The geotextiles that separate the drainage layers from adjacent soil layers was selected based on the 33 ability of the geotextiles to retain the soil and to prevent the soil from entering the leachate collection and 34 removal systems. In addition, the amount of fine material in the drainage and sump gravels was limited 35 by specification to less than a few percent, and is not expected to cause clogging problems (Appendix 36 4A). Because the waste disposed in the lined landfill will be required to satisfy LDR 37 (RCW 70.105.050(2), WAC 173-303-140, and 40 CFR 268), the amount of organic material is minimal, 38 and consequently biologic clogging will not be a problem. 39 4.3.7 Liner System, Construction and Maintenance 40 Details relating to the liner system construction and maintenance are discussed in the following sections. 41 4.3.7.1 Material Specifications 42 Material specifications are provided in the following sections for each of the materials used in the liner 43 system. Chapter 4.21

--- Page 80 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4.3.7.1.1 Synthetic Liners 2 As described in Section 4.3.3.1, both the primary and secondary geomembrane liners consist of 3 high-density polyethylene. As described in Section 4.3.3.1.4, the primary barrier also contains a 4 geosynthetic clay liner placed on the floor area only. Detailed specifications were prepared for the lined 5 landfill as part of the design process. 6 4.3.7.1.2 Soil Liners 7 As described in Section 4.3.3.1, the soil liner consists of imported bentonite (expansive clay) blended 8 with fine soil deposits on or next to the IDF. The fine soil was free of roots, woody vegetation, rocks 9 greater than 2.54 centimeter in diameter, and other deleterious material. The bentonite content is 10 dependent on the characteristics of the fine soil. Mixing was performed under carefully controlled 11 conditions in a pugmill or other approved alternatives. The admix was placed and compacted to achieve 12 an in-place hydraulic conductivity of I x 10-7 centimeter per second or less. The final surface of the soil 13 liner was rolled smooth before placing the overlying geomembrane. Additional specifications were 14 prepared for the lined landfill as part of the design process. 15 4.3.7.1.3 Leachate Collection and Removal System 16 Drainage and sump gravel consisted of hard, durable, rounded to subrounded material. The gravel was 17 washed and the amount of fine material (i.e., passing the number 200 sieve) was limited to a few percent. 18 The hydraulic conductivity of the gravel is I x 102 centimeter per second or greater. Additional 19 specifications were prepared as part of the design process. 20 For geotextiles and geonets, the composition, thickness, transmissivity, unit weight, apparent opening 21 size, strength, and other properties were determined during detailed design based on results of engineering 22 analyses, experience, and industry standard approaches. 23 4.3.7.2 Construction Specifications 24 Construction requirements for major components of the lined landfill are summarized in the following 25 sections. 26 4.3.7.2.1 Liner System Foundation 27 The excavated subgrade surfaces was moisture conditioned and compacted as required to achieve the 28 specified compaction before placing the admix layer. 29 4.3.7.2.2 Soil Liners 30 The soil and bentonite was blended thoroughly and moisture conditioned so that the admix is uniform and 31 homogeneous throughout. The admix layer was placed in loose lifts and compacted so that the 32 compacted lift meets the requirements of the Construction Quality Assurance Plan. Each new lift of 33 admix was kneaded into the previously placed lift. The methods for admix preparation, type of 34 compaction equipment, number of passes, and other details of the placement process was determined by 35 constructing a test fill section before placing admix in the lined landfill. 36 4.3.7.2.3 Synthetic Liners 37 To protect the overlying geomembranes, the admix surface is smooth and free of deleterious material. In 38 all cases, the high-density polyethylene liner was deployed with the length of the roll parallel to the slope. 39 Adjacent panels were overlapped and thermally seamed using fusion or extrusion methods. Seams were 40 inspected continuously using air pressure tests. A vacuum box was used in areas where air pressure tests 41 cannot be used (e.g., extrusion weld areas). Destructive seam tests (ASTM D4437) (peel and adhesion) 42 were performed on samples taken at regular intervals. Placing the overlying geosynthetic layers when 43 practicable will protect the geomembranes. Chapter 4.22

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4.3.7.2.4 Leachate Collection and Removal Systems 2 Drainage and sump gravel was placed and spread carefully over the underlying geosynthetics using 3 suitable equipment to prevent damage. Hauling and placing equipment will operate on a minimum 4 thickness of soil above any geosynthetic layer to avoid damage. Geosynthetic layers in the leachate 5 collection and removal system were deployed, overlapped, and joined (e.g., tying for geonets, sewing for 6 geotextiles) according to standard industry practice and the manufacturers' recommendations. Drainage 7 and riser pipes were installed in the landfill. Pipes were bedded carefully and the landfill was backfilled 8 to provide adequate lateral support. Pumps and other mechanical components are installed according to 9 manufacturers' recommendations. 10 4.3.7.3 Construction Quality Control Program 11 A construction quality assurance plan (Appendix 4B) will be used during lined landfill construction and 12 establishes in detail the following in accordance with WAC 173-303-335: 13 Program must include observations, test, and measurements to ensure: 14 * Proper construction of all components of the liners, leachate collection and removal system. 15 * Conformity of all materials used in the design. 16 4.3.7.4 Maintenance Procedures for Leachate Collection and Removal Systems 17 The accessible components of the leachate collection and removal system will be maintained according to 18 preventive maintenance methods. These methods will require periodic testing to prove that the 19 equipment, controls, and instrumentation are functional and are calibrated properly. Testing intervals will 20 be derived from applicable regulations and manufacturer's recommendations. All pumps and motors will 21 be started or bumped monthly or at intervals suggested by the manufacturer, first, to demonstrate that the 22 pumps and motors are functional and second, to move the bearing(s) so that the bearing surfaces do not 23 seize or become distorted. Instruments will be calibrated annually or at intervals suggested by the 24 manufacturer. When applicable, the preventive maintenance methods will include calibration 25 instructions. The following instruments will require annual calibration: 26 * LCRS sump level indicator 27 * LDS sump level indicator 28 Other instrumentation inside the leachate handling and storage facilities will also require routine 29 maintenance. 30 4.3.7.5 Liner Repairs during Operations 31 Because of the 0.9-meter-thick operations layer, damage to the liner system is not expected. If damage 32 did occur, the operations layer could be removed laterally as far as required. Underlying geosynthetic and 33 gravel layers will be removed until an undamaged layer is encountered. The damaged layers will be 34 repaired and replaced from the lowest layer upwards using similar methods to those employed during 35 construction. Most repairs to the geomembranes will be performed using a patch, which will be placed, 36 welded, and tested by construction quality assurance personnel. 37 4.3.8 Run-On and Runoff Control Systems 38 Because of the sandy soils, small drainage area, and arid climate at the IDF, stormwater run-on and 39 run-off will not be expected to require major engineered structures. Interceptor and drainage ditches will 40 be adequate for run-on and run-off control. The 25-year, 24-hour precipitation event was the design 41 storm used to size the lined landfill systems. Beyond this, surface water evaluation is highly site-specific, 42 and appropriate analyses were performed as part of detailed design for the lined landfill. Chapter 4.23

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4.3.8.1 Run-on Control System 2 Run-on will be controlled by drainage ditches or berms around the perimeter of the lined landfill. Any 3 overland flow approaching the landfill will be intercepted by the ditches or berms and will be conveyed to 4 existing drainage systems or suitable discharge points. All the drainage ditches or berms were designed 5 to handle the peak 25-year flow from the potential drainage area. By using low channel slopes, design 6 flow velocities in the ditches will be maintained below established limits for sand channels. 7 Between the landfill crest and the perimeter road, the area will be graded to provide drainage toward the 8 perimeter road. The perimeter road will be sloped outward, at a grade of approximately 2 percent, to 9 provide drainage away from the landfill. On the outside of the perimeter road, drainage ditches will be 10 excavated to provide drainage away from the landfill. 11 4.3.8.1.1 Design and Performance 12 Design and performance details were determined for the landfill as part of the detailed design process. 13 4.3.8.1.2 Calculation of Peak Flow 14 Computation of design discharge for the drainage ditches or berms was performed using standard 15 analytical methods, such as the Rational Method or the computer program HEC- I (USACE 1981). The 16 25-year, 24-hour precipitation depth is 4.0 centimeters, based on precipitation data recorded from 1947 to 17 1969 (PNL-4622). The tributary area for each section of ditch or berm was based on local topography. 18 4.3.8.2 Runoff Control System 19 There will be no run-off from the lined landfill because the landfill will be constructed below grade. Any 20 precipitation falling on the landfill will be removed by either evapotranspiration or the leachate collection 21 and removal systems. Therefore, a run-off control system will not be needed. 22 4.3.8.3 Construction 23 The drainage ditches or berms around the lined landfill were constructed with conventional earthmoving 24 equipment such as graders and small dozers. 25 4.3.8.4 Maintenance 26 The drainage ditches or berms require periodic maintenance to ensure proper performance. The most 27 frequent maintenance activity, beyond periodic inspection, will be cleaning the ditches or berms to 28 remove obstructions caused by windblown soil and vegetation (e.g., tumbleweeds). After rare storm 29 events, regrading of the ditch bottom or repair of the berm might be required to repair erosion damage. 30 This is expected to occur infrequently; however, inspections will be conducted after 25-year storm events 31 or at least annually. 32 4.3.9 Control of Wind Dispersal 33 The IDF will use varied methods to prevent wind dispersal of mixed waste and backfill materials, 34 depending on the waste form. Methods to prevent wind dispersal include containerizing, stabilizing, 35 grouting, spray fixitants, and backfill. In other instances, the operating contractor implements a wind 36 speed restriction during handling, and immediately backfills the waste to prevent wind dispersal. 37 4.3.10 Liquids in Landfills 38 Free liquids will not be accepted except as allowed by Chapter 3.0, Section 1.2. Waste received at the 39 IDF must comply with waste acceptance requirements. 40 4.3.11 Containerized Waste 41 Containerized waste received in the IDF lined landfill will be limited to a maximum of 10 percent void 42 space. Several inert materials (diatomaceous earth, sand, lava rock) will be used as acceptable void space 43 fillers for waste that does not fill the container. Chapter 4.24

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 1.0 INTRODUCTION 2 1.1 Purpose 3 The purpose of the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF) is to develop the capability for near surface disposal 4 of Immobilized Low-Activity Waste (ILAW) waste packages from the River Protection Project-Waste 5 Treatment and Immobilization Plant (RPP-WTP). The IDF is essential in meeting the overall U.S. 6 Department of Energy, Office of River Protection (ORP) mission to store, retrieve, treat, and dispose of 7 the highly radioactive Hanford tank waste in an environmentally sound, safe, and cost-effective manner. 8 The IDF will also provide capacity for disposal of mixed low-level waste (MLLW) and low-level (LLW) 9 from the DBVS. The detailed design for the IDF Phase I Critical Systems landfill will finalize the design 10 process for the: 11 * Landfill liner system 12 * Leachate removal system 13 * Leak detection system (LDS) 14 The IDF detailed design also involves completing all design work required for an operable landfill and 15 supporting the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) Part B permitting for the IDF. 16 This Phase I Critical Systems Design Report (the Design Report) provides documentation of engineering 17 calculations, criteria, and information that have been developed as part of the IDF detailed design for 18 Phase I. Specifically, the Design Report documents the following important design information: 19 * Identifies key design requirements for the project (Section 2). 20 * Summarizes studies on site conditions and investigations that have been used in the development 21 of detailed design parameters for the critical systems (Sections 3 and 4). 22 * Presents detailed engineering analysis performed in the development of the Phase I Critical 23 Systems design and updated during construction implementation (Section 5). 24 * Provides system component descriptions, references important construction quality assurance 25 (QA) requirements, and describes important interfaces with non-critical systems (Section 6). 26 * Describes operating provisions that have influenced the development of the design including 27 waste placement requirements, operational interfaces with other Hanford facilities, and leakage 28 response action plan requirements (Section 7). 29 1.2 Scope 30 1.2.1 General 31 CH2M HILL, Inc. (Affiliate) is responsible for production of a cost-effective final design and to produce 32 critical systems detailed design documents and construction specifications to facilitate RCRA permit 33 approval of the IDF. The IDF technical requirements are found in the following documents: 34 * Immobilized Low-Activity Waste (ILAW) Project Definition Criteria, Revision I (RPP-7898) 35 * System Specifications for ILAW Disposal, Revision 3 (RPP-7307) 36 * Hanford Environmental Management Specification (DOE/RL-97-55) 37 Design products are to be prepared in compliance with the technical requirements, as well as with other 38 specific procedures that are dictated by CH2M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. (CH2M HILL) requirements 39 and outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW), Integrated Disposal Facility Detailed Design Support 40 (Rev. 2, 2003), described in more detail under Section 2 of this Design Report. The overall design work 41 includes reports, schedules, estimates, and other special services as specified in the SOW. As part of the 42 design effort, the Affiliate will perform the following global tasks: Appendix 4A. 1.15

--- Page 101 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Develop a conceptual layout and preliminary design drawings for the IDF. The IDF preliminary 2 layout will depict a single expandable landfill system, with capability for segregation of RCRA 3 regulated and non-regulated waste placement and segregated leachate management systems. 4 * Develop a detailed design that meets the requirements of the ILAW Project Definition Criteria 5 and the ILAW System Specification. 6 * Develop the construction specifications for the detailed design. 7 * Ensure that there is full technical integration between all detailed design reports prepared for the 8 detailed design of the IDF. 9 * Perform the design activities in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. 10 The design will implement the safety and health protection requirements imposed on the design by the 11 SOW and the technical baseline criteria documents, and will comply with all applicable regulatory 12 requirements for the project. It is important to note that although the design is for identified critical 13 systems of the Phase I IDF, a preliminary safety evaluation was performed for the W-520 Project that 14 identified no safety class items, including criticality safety (Conceptual Design Report for ILA WFacility, 15 CH2M HILL, May 2001). 16 The timely completion of the critical system detail design of the IDF, in compliance with the RCRA 17 permit approval process (Washington Administrative Code [WAC] 173-303-665 and 173-303-806[4][h]), 18 is a critical component of the SOW. Drawings, construction specifications, and reports needed to obtain 19 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) certification and Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) 20 approval of the IDF RCRA Part B permit is the overall goal of the project. The detailed design for the 21 initial Phase I disposal landfill and the critical systems design include the liner system, the leachate 22 collection system, and the LDS. The detailed design will produce an operable landfill design and support 23 the IDF RCRA Part B permitting. 24 1.2.2 Design Report 25 The Design Report describes the key facility components and provides the design basis and detailed 26 calculations that support the development of drawings and specifications. Key facility components that 27 are described in the Design Report include: 28 * Facility layout (location, access roads and operational ramps, survey control system). 29 * Landfill geometry (disposal volume total and per disposal unit, disposal unit dimensions). 30 * Disposal unit grading design (foundation soils contour, lower admixture layer contour, operations 31 layer cover contour). 32 * Grid point listing (grid point number, location, and elevation for all grid points required for 33 construction of the IDF). 34 * Geosynthetic material design (primary geomembrane, secondary geomembrane, geotextile, and 35 geocomposite drainage layer). 36 * Leachate collection and removal system (LCRS) and LDS design (sump design, removal system 37 design-LCRS and LDS, leachate level monitoring system design, transfer pump as required to 38 meet WAC-173-303-665(2)(h)(ii) to ensure that the leachate depth over the liner does not exceed 39 12 inches). 40 * Leachate temporary storage tank system design (tank volume, tank design, tank materials/ 41 leachate compatibility, tank coating, tank secondary containment system), including electrical and 42 power requirements necessary to support the leachate removal systems. 43 * Pump controls and instrumentation design (control, operations, monitoring, and control building 44 design). 45 * Operational storm water management design. Appendix 4A.1.16

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Backfill placement requirements and process (minimize void space, minimize subsidence of 2 waste, placement and material requirements to ensure there are no adverse effects on the waste 3 packages). 4 * Other facility designs identified as necessary to support the project completion. 5 The Design Report includes design calculations that are prepared in accordance with the requirements of 6 procedure HNF-IP-0842 Vol. 4, Section 3.6 (July 30, 2002). Important calculations that are documented 7 include: 8 Stability (liner side slope [each liner layer based on interface strength], requirements for verification for 9 critical interface strengths, fill placement ramp, global stability of the overall design, and other relevant 10 stability analysis). 11 Seismic analysis (side slope and global embankment stability under seismic loading, and seismic design 12 of structures) 13 Bearing capacity (liner sub-grade soils and other relevant bearing capacity analysis) 14 Total settlement, differential settlement, and uplift analysis (foundations soils, compacted admixture 15 layers, total settlement, top slope drainage evaluation, subsidence and sinkhole potential, uplift potential, 16 and other relevant settlement analysis). 17 Admix liner analysis (liner admixture bearing capacity, admix liner specifications, desiccation cracking, 18 and other relevant liner admixture analysis). 19 Geomembrane liner analysis (liner tension caused by thermal contraction/ expansion, anchor trench 20 pullout analysis, puncture resistance, potential stress cracking, leachate compatibility, chemical and 21 radiation resistance, mechanical degradation from operational traffic, and other relevant geomembrane 22 analysis). 23 Drainage layers analysis (geotextile analysis and selection, geocomposite selection, drainage gravel 24 selection analysis, and other relevant drainage analysis). 25 LCRS/LDS analysis (clogging prevention in LCRS, design of leachate collection sumps, design of high 26 capacity and low capacity leachate removal pumping systems, design of leachate storage tank and 27 secondary containment system, leachate depth monitoring system, design of leachate system control 28 building, leachate compatibility of components in the LCRS, and other relevant leachate analysis). 29 Leachate system earth loading analysis (LCRS and LDS slope riser pipes, LCRS collection pipe, leachate 30 transfer pipes, and other relevant system loading analysis). 31 Surface stormwater analysis (operations in-cell stormwater management, operations runon/runoff water 32 management, site stormwater collection/evaporation management system, and other relevant storm water 33 analysis). 34 Leachate production analysis (average annual leachate production, peak daily leachate production, 35 leachate tank storage capacity, leachate transportation truck capacity, and trip frequency) 36 Action leakage rate (ALR) analysis (the maximum design flow rate that the secondary leachate collection, 37 detection, and removal system can remove without the fluid head on the bottom liner exceeding one foot; 38 calculation and justification of the maximum leachate infiltration rate through the primary liner system; a 39 response action plan in case the maximum ALR is exceeded during operation of the IDF). 40 Updates to calculations that have occurred through the construction process, either during independent 41 quality reviews of tank systems, in response to contractor's requests for information, or changes 42 implemented during construction have been attached to the original calculations in the appendices. 43 Compliance matrices have been developed to demonstrate detailed design compliance with the applicable 44 sections of the regulations (WAC 173-303) and with project-specific specifications, criteria, reports, 45 codes, and standards. Appendix 4A.1.17

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Updates to the matrices that have resulted from the completion of construction activities and associated 2 documentation are also provided. These matrices are presented in the Design Report in Appendix A. 3 1.3 Authorization 4 After careful consideration and evaluation, CH2M HILL elected to self-perform the IDF Phase I Critical 5 Systems design. As such, the design is being performed as an inter-company work assignment by the 6 Affiliate under the direction of CH2M HILL. CH2M HILL was authorized to self-perform the work by 7 the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of River Protection (ORP), in a letter dated December 9, 2002. 8 CH2M HILL's Prime Contract Number with the ORP is DE-ACO6-99RL 14047. The inter-company 9 work assignment is Contract 12317, Release 22, dated November 7, 2002. 10 1.4 General Facility Description 11 The IDF will consist of an expandable lined landfill located in the 200 East area on the Hanford Facility 12 (HF). The landfill will be divided lengthwise into two distinct cells, one for disposal of low-level waste 13 (LLW) and the other for disposal of mixed waste. The mission of the IDF will include the following 14 functions: 15 * Provide an approved disposal facility for the permanent, environmentally safe disposition of 16 ILAW packages that meets the environmental requirements and is approved by the DOE and 17 Ecology. 18 * Receive ILAW from River Protection Project (RPP) tank operations and dispose this waste 19 onsite. Receive waste from the DBVS and dispose this waste onsite. 20 * A more detailed discussion of waste types and the necessary storage volumes for these wastes is 21 provided in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. 22 * The IDF will be constructed on 25 hectares of vacant land southwest of the Plutonium Uranium 23 Extraction Facility (PUREX) Plant in the 200 East Area. The IDF will consist of a lined landfill 24 that will be constructed in several phases. The landfill will be segregated into a RCRA permitted 25 cell and a non-RCRA permitted cell. The scope of this permit is limited to the western cell of the 26 landfill where the RCRA waste will be stored and disposed. The landfill is designed to 27 accommodate four layers of vitrified LAW waste containers separated vertically by 0.9-meters of 28 soil. 29 * This initial construction will start at the northern edge and the size is approximately 223 meters 30 East/West by 233 meters North/South by 14 meters deep. At this initial size, IDF disposal 31 capacity is 82,000 cubic meters of waste. Subsequent construction phase(s) will require a 32 modification to the Part B Permit to be constructed after waste placement has progressed in the 33 landfill to the point that additional disposal capacity is needed. This approach minimizes the 34 open area susceptible to collection of rainwater and subsequent leachate 35 * The landfill is currently estimated at full build out to be up to 446 meters wide by 555 meters in 36 length by up to 14 meters deep. The RCRA regulated portion of the landfill would be half of that 37 at approximately 223 meters wide by 555 meters long by up to 14 meters deep providing a waste 38 disposal capacity of up to 450,000 cubic meters. 39 * Both cells will have a RCRA C-compliant liner system that consists of an upper primary liner 40 overlying a lower secondary liner. The upper liner will consist of a composite geomembrane 41 liner and geosynthetic clay liner system on the bottom area, and a single geomembrane on the 42 side slope. The secondary liner will consist of a composite geomembrane, overlying a 43 3-foot-thick soil admix liner. A LCRS and a LDS will overly the primary and secondary liner 44 system, respectively. A Secondary Leak Detection System (SLDS) will be located below the clay 45 liner, beneath the LDS sump. 46 * The IDF also will include a less than 90-day accumulation area of leachate for storage in two 47 tanks, one per landfill half. The leachate storage tanks will be located at the north end, in close 48 proximity to the lined landfill. Appendix 4A. 1.18

--- Page 104 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Each tank will be protected by secondary containment (double-lined tanks). Leak detection will 2 be provided by monitoring of the secondary containment. The collected leachate will be stored 3 and sampled before transfer to an onsite Treatment Storage and Disposal (TSD) unit or offsite 4 TSD facility. The less than 90-day storage leachate collection tank will be operated in 5 accordance with the generator provisions of WAC 173-303-200 and WAC 173-303-640, as 6 referenced by WAC 173-303-200. The overall side development plan is shown in Figure 1-2. 7 * The landfill will be constructed in several phases. Starting at the northern edge, approximately 8 one-third of the total length of the landfill will be constructed in Phase I. This will include the 9 leachate collection system and 90-day accumulation tanks. The subsequent phases will be 10 constructed after waste has been placed in the landfill and additional disposal capacity is needed. 11 This approach will minimize the amount of open area susceptible to collection of rainwater and 12 subsequent leachate. 13 * Before disposal, all waste will meet land disposal restriction requirements Revised Code of 14 Washington 70.105.050(2), WAC 173-303-140, and 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 268, 15 incorporated by reference in WAC 173-303-1401. 16 * Future landfill development and configuration within the IDF will be subject to change as 17 disposal techniques improve or as waste management needs dictate. Additional IDF landfill 18 development beyond the 62 acres will be subject to an approved permit modification, in 19 accordance with the HF RCRA Permit (Ecology, 2001). 20 * Public access to the IDF will be restricted. Figure 1-3 depicts the normal transportation routes 21 within the 200 East Area. Trucks typically will be used to transport waste to the IDF and will 22 range in size from heavy-duty pickups to tractor-trailer rigs, depending on the size and weight of 23 the load. In some cases, special equipment (such as transporters) will be used for unusual or 24 unique loads. When special equipment is used, a prior evaluation will ensure that the equipment 25 does not damage the roadways. 26 * Approximately 60 personnel will traverse this roadway, in personal vehicles in three shifts per 27 24 hours per week.

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 2.0 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS 2 Minimum design requirements for the IDF Phase I Critical Systems Design were provided by CH2M 3 HILL in the SOW for Requisition # 92859, Integrated Disposal Facility Detailed Design Support, 4 Revision 2, February 18, 2003. The IDF Phase I Critical Systems Design has been performed in 5 compliance with all applicable design requirements, defined in Sections 2.1 through 2.7, and these 6 requirements are: 7 * Washington State Dangerous Waste Regulations (WAC 173-303) 8 * System Specification for Immobilized Low-Activity Waste Disposal System, Revision 3 9 (RPP-7307) 10 * ILAW Project Definition Criteria for Integrated Disposal Facility, Revision 1 (RPP-7898) 11 * Hanford Site Environmental Management Specification, Revision 2 (DOE/RL-97-55) 12 * Design Loads for Tank Farm Facilities (TFC-ENG-STD-06, REV A) 13 * Technical baseline documents listed in Section 3.1 of the SOW 14 * Applicable national codes and standards 15 2.1 Washington State Dangerous Waste Regulations 16 The Washington State Dangerous Waste Regulations (WAC 173-303) implement Subtitle C of Public 17 Law 94-580, the RCRA in the State of Washington. By conforming to the requirements of 18 WAC 173-303, the design of the IDF Phase I Critical Systems also complies with the federal hazardous 19 waste requirements contained in 40 CFR 264, Standards for Owners and Operators ofHazardous Waste 20 Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities. Appendix A. I provides a compliance matrix of where the 21 applicable WAC 173-303 requirements are addressed in the IDF Phase I Critical Systems detailed design 22 documents, or are addressed in documentation developed as a result of facility construction. 23 2.2 System Specification 24 The System Specification for Immobilized Low-Activity Waste Disposal System, Revision 3 (RPP-7307) 25 contains the Level 1 system requirements for the Immobilized Low-Activity Waste Disposal System, of 26 which the IDF is a part. Appendix A.2 provides a compliance matrix of where the applicable Level 1 27 system requirements are addressed in the IDF Phase I Critical Systems detailed design documents, or are 28 addressed in documentation developed as a result of facility construction. 29 2.3 Project Definition Criteria 30 The ILAWProject Definition Criteria for Integrated Disposal Facility, Revision I (RPP-7898) contains 31 the design criteria for the IDF, including requirements flow-down from RPP-7303, System Specification 32 for ILAWDisposal System, and DOE/RL-97-55, Hanford Site Environmental Management Specification. 33 Appendix A.3 provides a compliance matrix of where the applicable design criteria are addressed in the 34 IDF Phase I Critical Systems detailed design documents, or are addressed in documentation developed as 35 a result of facility construction. 36 2.4 Hanford Site Environmental Management Specification 37 The Hanford Site Environmental Management Specification (site specification), Revision 2 38 (DOE/RL-97-55) documents the top-level mission technical requirements for work involved in the 39 Richland Operations Office, Hanford Site cleanup and infrastructure activities, under the responsibility of 40 the DOE Office of Environmental Management. It also provides the basis for all contract technical 41 requirements. Section 3.3.2, 200 Area Materials and Waste Management of the site specification contains 42 the requirements for receiving and onsite disposal of ILAW from RPP tank operations. The documents, 43 orders, and laws referenced in the site specification represent only the most salient sources of 44 requirements. As such, the site specification is assumed to have no significant measurable requirements 45 that would directly affect the IDF Phase I Critical Systems design. Appendix 4A.1.21

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 2.5 Design Loads for Tank Farm Facilities 2 The Design Loads for Tank Farm Facilities (TFC-ENG-STD-06, REV A) defines the design 3 requirements for systems, structures, and components (SSCs), and provides the minimum criteria for 4 structural design and evaluation of SSCs. The standard establishes structural design loads and acceptance 5 criteria for use in designing new SSCs. Figure 1 of this standard indicates that for new SSCs, structures 6 and anchorage of systems and components are to be designed per DOE-STD-1020-02 and Section 3.0 of 7 this standard. These were used for the design of the IDF Critical Systems facilities. The IDF Critical 8 Systems facilities were defined by CH2M HILL as being Performance Category (PC)-1. The PC-i 9 requirements in this standard were used in the structural design of the facilities included in IDF Phase I 10 Critical Systems. 11 2.6 Technical Baseline Documents 12 The technical baseline documents are listed in Section 3.1 of the SOW. These documents include the 13 System Specification for Immobilized Low-Activity Waste Disposal System, ILAW Project Definition 14 Criteria for Integrated Disposal Facility, Hanford Site Environmental Management Specification, and 15 Design Loads for Tank Farm Facilities, discussed in the preceding sections. 16 2.7 National Codes and Standards 17 In addition to WAC 173-303, the system specification, project definition criteria, site specification, and 18 tank farm design loads that are discussed above, the IDF Phase I Critical Systems design was guided by 19 other applicable sections of accepted professional and industry standards.

This information was obtained primarily from the ILA WPreliminary Closure Plan for the 15 Disposal Facility (RPP-69 11) and other Hanford Site data sources. It is intended to provide a general 16 characterization of the IDF site conditions that are pertinent to the design of the IDF Phase I Critical 17 Systems. 18 3.1 Geography 19 The following paragraphs briefly describe the geography of the IDF site and are prepared from 20 information in the ILAW Preliminary Closure Plan for the Disposal Facility (RPP-691 1). 21 3.1.1 Site Location 22 The location of the IDF is on the Hanford Central Plateau, in the 200 East Area within the Hanford Site 23 boundary. The site identified for the IDF is 68 hectares (168 acres) of vacant and uncontaminated land, 24 located southwest of the PUREX plant in the 200 East Area. It is bounded on the south by 1st Street and 25 on the north by 4th Street. 26 3.1.2 Site Description 27 The IDF landfill will occupy approximately 25 hectares (62 acres) of the site identified for the facility. 28 The remainder of the site will be used for soil stockpile, leachate storage tanks, operations support 29 facilities, roads, parking areas, and open space. The IDF in Phase I will be approximately 11 hectares (28 30 acres). Phase I will be located at the north end of the IDF landfill and will include provisions for 31 expansion to the south for future phases. 32 3.2 Meteorology and Climatology 33 The following paragraphs briefly describe the climate of the IDF site and are prepared from information 34 in the ILA WPreliminary Closure Plan for the Disposal Facility (RPP-69 11), which presented summary 35 data from the Hanford Meteorological Station (HMS). Conditions at the HMS are considered similar to 36 those at the IDF site. Detailed information is available in the Hanford Site Climatological Data Summary 37 2001, with Historical Data (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, May 2002). The IDF Phase I Critical 38 Systems is designed to operate in the climatic conditions reported in that document. 39 3.2.1 Precipitation 40 The site sits within the Pasco Basin, characterized as a semi-arid region because of its low annual 41 precipitation levels. The basin receives 16 cm (6.3 inches) of annual average precipitation, with nearly 42 half occurring in the winter months. Historical records indicate that the annual precipitation has varied 43 from a low of 8 cm (3.1 inches) to a high of 30 cm (11.8 inches). Precipitation of 4 cm (1.56 inches) in 44 24 hours reportedly can be expected to occur once every 25 years. Appendix 4A. 1.23

--- Page 109 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 However, based on the Hanford Site Climatological Data Summary 2001, a value of 1.28 inches was used 2 for the 24-hour, 25-year precipitation in the IDF Phase I Critical Systems stormwater design analysis (see 3 Appendix C.9). Total annual snowfall has varied from 0.8 cm to 110 cm (0.31 to 43.3 inches), with an 4 average annual snowfall of 34 cm (24.4 inches). 5 3.2.2 Temperature 6 Temperature conditions for the site range from extremely cold during the winter months to extremely 7 warm during the summer months. Local temperatures can reach -18 degrees C (0 degrees F) during some 8 winter months. January is the coldest month, with an average temperature of -2 degrees C (29 degrees F). 9 The lowest temperature ever recorded was -33 degrees C (-27 degrees F). During some summer months, 10 daytime temperatures can exceed 40 degrees C (104 degrees F). July is the warmest month, with daily 11 high and low temperatures averaging 33 and 25 degrees C (92 and 61 degrees F), respectively. The 12 highest temperature ever recorded was 46 degrees C (115 degrees F). 13 3.2.3 Wind 14 Wind conditions can vary considerably throughout the year. The monthly average is about 10 15 kilometers/hour (6 miles/hour) during the winter and 15 kilometers/hour (9 miles/hour) during the 16 summer. Wind speeds, especially during summer storm activity, can reach many times the average 17 levels. The greatest peak gust was 130 kilometers/hour (81 miles/hour), recorded at 15 meters (50 feet) 18 above the ground at the HMS. 19 3.2.4 Relative Humidity 20 The seasonal variation in the relative humidity is considerable, according to records of the HMS. The 21 annual mean relative humidity recorded at HMS is approximately 54 percent, with the highest monthly 22 average relative humidity (80 percent) occurring in December and the lowest monthly average relative 23 humidity (32 percent) occurring in July. Daily relative humidity can change 20 to 30 percent between 24 early morning and late afternoon, except in the winter months when changes are less pronounced. 25 3.3 Ecology 26 The following paragraphs briefly describe the ecology of the Hanford Site and are prepared from 27 information in the ILA WPreliminary Closure Plan for the Disposal Facility (RPP-69 11). The site 28 consists of undeveloped land and is characterized as a shrub-steppe environment. This environment 29 contains numerous plants and animal species, adapted to the regions semi-arid climate. Because of the 30 aridity and low water-holding capacity of the soils, the productivity of both plants and animals is 31 relatively low. The IDF site exhibits many of these same general characteristics, although to varying 32 degrees. 33 3.3.1 Flora 34 The dominant plants on the Hanford Site are big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, cheatgrass, Russian thistle, and 35 Sandberg's bluegrass, with cheatgrass providing half of the plant cover. Root penetration to depths of 36 over 3 m has not been demonstrated in the 200 Areas. Rabbitbrush roots have been found only at a depth 37 of 2.4 m (8 feet) near the 200 Areas. 38 3.3.2 Fauna 39 A variety of birds and mammals inhabit the Hanford Site. The most abundant nesting birds of the shrub- 40 steppe at the site are the horned lark and western meadowlark. Significant populations of chukar and grey 41 partridge inhabit the Hanford Site. The most abundant mammals at the site are mice, ground squirrels, 42 gophers, voles, and cottontail rabbits. Larger animals include mule deer and elk. The coyote is the 43 principal mammalian predator on the Hanford Site. Appendix 4A. 1.24

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 3.4 Geology 2 3.4.1 Regional Geology 3 The 200 East Area lies on the Cold Creek bar, a geomorphic remnant of the cataclysmic, glacial related 4 floods of the Pleistocene Epoch. As the floodwaters raced across the lowlands of the Pasco Basin and 5 Hanford Site, floodwaters lost energy and began to deposit sand and gravel. The 200 Area Plateau is one 6 of the most prominent deposits. The 200 Area Plateau lies just southwest of one of the major flood 7 channels across the Hanford Site that forms the topographic lowland south of Gable Mountain. 8 Borehole data provide the principal source of geologic, hydrologic, and groundwater information for the 9 200 East Area and the IDF site. Numerous boreholes (both vadose zone boreholes and-groundwater 10 monitoring wells) have been drilled in the 200 East Area for groundwater monitoring and waste 11 management studies (Figure 3-1 shows the location of groundwater wells near the IDF site). However, 12 data are limited within the IDF site, primarily because no previous construction or waste disposal 13 activities have occurred in this part of the HF. Most boreholes in the 200 East area have been drilled 14 using the cable tool method and either a hard tool or drive barrel to advance the hole. Some boreholes 15 have been drilled by rotary and wire-line coring methods. More recently, boreholes in the area have been 16 drilled, and in five cases cored, by percussion hammer methods. Geologic logs are based on examination 17 of drill core, chips, and cuttings from these boreholes. Chip samples typically are taken at 1.5-meter (4.92 18 feet) intervals and routinely archived at the Hanford Geotechnical Sample Library. 19 3.4.2 Site Geology 20 The IDF site will be located south of the Gable Mountain segment of the Umtanum Ridge anticline and 21 about 3 kilometers (1.86 miles) north of the axis of the Cold Creek syncline, that controls the structural 22 grain of the basalt bedrock and the Ringold Formation. The basalt surface and Ringold Formation trend 23 roughly southeast-northwest parallel to the major geologic structures of the site. As a result, the Ringold 24 Formation and the underlying Columbia River Basalt Group gently dip to the south off the Umtanum 25 Ridge anticline into the Cold Creek syncline. 26 Geologic mapping on the Hanford Site and examination of drill core and borehole cuttings in the area 27 have not identified any faults in the vicinity of the IDF site (DOE/RW-0164). The closest known faults 28 are along the Umtanum Ridge-Gable Mountain structure, north of the disposal site and the May Junction 29 Fault east of the site (Figure 3-2). 30 3.4.2.1 Stratigraphy 31 The basalt and post-basalt stratigraphy for the IDF site is shown in Figure 3-3. Approximately 137 to 167 32 meters (449 to 548 feet) of suprabasalt sediments overlie the basalt bedrock at the site. 33 Basalt Bedrock. Previous studies (RHO-BWI-ST-14; Reidel and Fecht, 1994) have shown that the 34 youngest lava flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group at the 200 East Area are those of the 35 10.5 million-year old Elephant Mountain Member. This member underlies the entire 200 East area and 36 surrounding area, and forms the base of the suprabasalt aquifer. No erosional windows in the basalt are 37 known or suspected to occur in the area of the IDF site. 38 Ringold Formation. Few boreholes penetrate the entire Ringold Formation at the IDF site, so available 39 data are limited. The Ringold Formation reaches a maximum thickness of 95 meters (312 feet) on the 40 west side of the site and thins eastward. The member of Wooded Island (Figure 3-3) is the only member 41 of the Ringold Formation in the 200 East Area. The deepest Ringold Formation unit encountered is the 42 lower gravel, unit A. Lying above unit A is the lower mud, and overlying the lower mud is an upper 43 gravel, unit E. The sand and silt units of the members of Taylor Flat and Savage Island of the Ringold 44 Formation are not present at the IDF site. Unit A and unit E are equivalent to the Pliocene-Miocene 45 continental conglomerates (Reidel and Fecht, 1994). The lower mud is equivalent to the 46 Pliocene-Miocene continental sand, silt, and clay beds (Reidel and Fecht, 1994). Appendix 4A. 1.25

--- Page 111 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Only three boreholes have penetrated unit A in the area of the IDF site. Unit A is 19 meters (62 feet) 2 thick on the west side of the site and thins to the northeast. Unit A is partly to well-cemented 3 conglomerate consisting of both felsic and basaltic clasts in a sandy matrix and is interpreted as fluvial 4 gravel facies (Lindsey, 1996). There are minor beds of yellow to white interbedded sand and silt. 5 Green-colored, reduced-iron stain is present on some grains and pebbles. Although the entire unit appears 6 to be cemented, the zone produced abundant high-quality water in borehole 299-E17-21 (PNNL-l 1957, 7 1998). 8 Nineteen meters (62 feet) of the lower mud unit were encountered in one borehole at the IDF site 9 (PNNL-1 1957, 1998). The uppermost one-meter or so consists of a yellow mud to sandy mud. The 10 yellow mud grades downward into about 10 meters (33 feet) of blue mud. The blue mud, in turn, grades 11 down into seven meters (23 feet) of brown mud with organic rich zones and occasional wood fragments. 12 The lower mud unit is absent in the center of the site (northeast of borehole 299-E24-7 on Figure 3-4). 13 Unit E is described as a sandy gravel to gravelly sand. Unit E is interpreted to consist of as much as 14 15 meters (49 feet) of conglomerate, with scattered large pebbles and cobbles up to 25 centimeters (9.84 15 inches) in size in a sandy matrix. The gravel consists of both felsic and basaltic rocks that are well 16 rounded, with a sand matrix supporting the cobbles and pebbles. Cementation of this unit ranges from 17 slight to moderate. The upper contact of unit E is not identified easily at the IDF site. In the western part 18 of the study area, unconsolidated gravels of the Hanford formation directly overly the Ringold Formation 19 unit E gravels, making exact placement of the contact difficult. The dominance of basalt and the absence 20 of cementation in the Hanford formation are the key criteria used to distinguishing these 21 (PNNL-1 1957, 1998). In the central and northeast part of the area, unit E has been eroded completely. 22 Unconsolidated gravels and sands typical of the Hanford formation replace unit E. 23 Unconformity at the Top of the Ringold Formation. The surface of the Ringold Formation is irregular 24 in the area of the IDF site. A northwest-southeast trending erosional channel or trough is centered 25 through the northeast portion of the site. The trough is deepest near borehole 299-E24-21 in the northern 26 part of the site (PNNL-13652, 2001). This trough is interpreted as part of a larger trough under the 27 200 East Area, resulting from scouring by the Missoula floods. 28 Hanford formation. The Hanford formation is as much as 116 meters (381 feet) thick in and around the 29 IDF site. The Hanford formation thickens in the erosional channel cut into the Ringold Formation and 30 thins to the southwest along the margin of the channel. 31 At the IDF site, the Hanford formation consists mainly of sand dominated facies and less amounts of silt 32 dominated and gravel dominated facies. The Hanford formation has been described as poorly sorted 33 pebble to boulder gravel and fine- to coarse-grained sand, with lesser amounts of interstitial and 34 interbedded silt and clay. In previous studies of the site (WHC-MR-0391, 1991), the Hanford formation 35 was described as consisting of three units: an upper and lower gravel facies and a sand facies between the 36 two gravelly units. The upper gravel dominated facies appears to be thin or absent in the immediate area 37 of the IDF site (PNNL-12257, 1999; PNNL-13652, 2001; PNNL-14029, 2002). 38 The lowermost part of the Hanford formation encountered in boreholes at the IDF site consists of the 39 gravel-dominated facies. Drill core and cuttings from boreholes 299-E17-21, 299-E17-22, 299-E17-23, 40 299-E17-25, and 299-E24-21 indicate that the unit is a clast-supported pebble- to cobble-gravel with 41 minor amounts of sand in the matrix. The cobbles and pebbles almost are exclusively basalt, with no 42 cementation. This unit pinches out west of the IDF site and thickens to the east and northeast 43 (Figure 3-4). The water table beneath the IDF site is located in the lower gravel unit. The lower gravel 44 unit is interpreted to be Missoula flood gravels, deposited in the erosional channel carved into the 45 underlying Ringold Formation. 46 47 Appendix 4A. 1.26

--- Page 112 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I The upper portion of the Hanford formation consists of at least 73 meters (240 feet) of 2 fine-to coarse-grained sand, with minor amounts of silt and clay and some gravelly sands. 3 Holocene Deposits. Holocene, eolian deposits cover the southern part of the IDF site. Caliche coatings 4 on the bottom of pebbles and cobbles in drill cores through this unit are typical of Holocene caliche 5 development in the Columbia Basin. The southern part of the IDF site is capped by a stabilized sand 6 dune. The eolian unit is composed of fine- to coarse-grained sands with abundant silt, as layers and as 7 material mixed with the sand. 8 Clastic Dikes. A clastic dike was encountered in borehole C3828, adjacent to well 299-E17-25 at the 9 IDF site. Clastic dikes also have been observed in excavations surrounding the site (e.g., U.S. Ecology, 10 the former Grout area, the 216-BC cribs, the Central Landfill, and the Environmental Restoration 11 Disposal Facility [PNNL, BHI-01 103]). In undisturbed areas such as the IDF site, clastic dikes typically 12 are not observed because these are covered by wind blown sediments. The occurrence of a clastic dike in 13 borehole C3828 suggests that these probably are present elsewhere in the subsurface at the disposal site. 14 3.4.3 Seismology 15 The IDF will be located in Zone 2B, as identified in the UBC (DOE/RL-91-28). The analyses in 16 Sections 5.1 and 5.12 provide additional seismic detail for design of liner and structural systems. 17 No active faults, or evidence of a fault that has had a displacement during Holocene times, have been 18 found on the Hanford Site (DOE/RL-91-28). The youngest faults recognized on the Hanford Site occur 19 on Gable Mountain, over 4.5 kilometers (2.78 miles) north of the 200 East Area. These faults are 20 Quaternary of age and are considered 'capable' by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (DOE/RL-91-28). 21 3.5 Hydrology 22 The following paragraphs briefly describe the known hydrology conditions of the Hanford Site and most 23 specifically the 200 Area Plateau where the IDF site is located. These are prepared from information in 24 the ILA WPreliminary Closure Plan for the Disposal Facility (RPP-691 1). 25 3.5.1 Surface Water 26 The IDF site is within the 200 East area, which is on a plateau above the Columbia River. The Columbia 27 River runs generally to the east and swings around the site, lying about 8 miles northwest and northeast of 28 the 200 East area. The project area is significantly higher than the Columbia River and is not in the 29 river's floodplain. 30 The soils in the project area are sandy with high rates of infiltration. Most of the precipitation falling on 31 the site infiltrates into the ground, and there are no significant long-term surface water features in the 32 project area. 33 3.5.2 Groundwater 34 The geologic structure of the 200 East area is composed of multiple layers of sediments that range from 35 sand, silt, volcanic ash, and clay to coarse gravels, cobbles, and conglomerates that overlay thick layers of 36 basaltic lava. An unconfined aquifer exists in the lower part of the sedimentary sequence, overlaying the 37 uppermost basalt layer. This relatively thin aquifer intercepts infiltration from the unsaturated zone above 38 it. The aquifer under the IDF site is approximately 90 to 100 meters (300 to 330 feet) below the ground 39 surface. Therefore, the groundwater table is well below the proposed bottom of the excavation for the 40 IDF and is not expected to influence the facility. The recharge of water into the ground at the IDF site is 41 expected to be small. This condition results primarily from the low levels of annual precipitation that 42 occur in the region of the IDF as well as the rest of the Hanford Site. A more detailed description of 43 groundwater beneath the IDF, developed from various site explorations performed in the site area, is 44 presented below. 45 The unconfined aquifer under the IDF site occurs in the fluvial gravels of the Ringold Formation and 46 flood deposits of the Hanford formation. Appendix 4A.1.27

--- Page 113 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The thickness of the aquifer ranges from about 70 meters (230 feet) at the southwest corner of the site to 2 about 30 meters (98 feet) under the northeast corner of the IDF site. The Elephant Mountain Member of 3 the Columbia River Basalt Group forms the base of the unconfined aquifer (Figure 3-3). 4 The unsaturated zone beneath the land surface at the IDF site is approximately 100 meters (328 feet) thick 5 and consists of the Hanford formation. The water level in boreholes in and around the site indicates that 6 the water table is in the lower gravel sequence of the Hanford formation and at an elevation of 7 approximately 123 meters (404 feet) above sea level. The water table is nearly flat beneath the IDF site. 8 Table 3-1 gives water level information from wells near the site. The locations of the wells are shown on 9 Figure 3-1. The latest water table map shows less than about 0.1 meter (3.94 inches) of hydraulic head 10 across the IDF site (PNNL-13404, 2001). 11 The Ringold Formation lower mud unit occurs within the aquifer at the southwest corner of the IDF site 12 (299-E17-21) but is absent in the central and northern parts of the site (299-E24-7 and 299-E24-21). The 13 lower mud unit is known to be a confining or partly confining layer at places under the Hanford Site 14 (PNNL-12261, 2000), and this might be the case under the southwest corner of the IDF site. 15 Groundwater samples were collected and analyzed from above and below the lower mud unit during 16 drilling of well 299-E17-21. Chemical parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, and Eh) were different in 17 the two samples, suggesting that the lower mud is at least partly confining in the area. No contamination 18 was found above or below the lower mud. An interpretation of the distribution and thickness of this 19 stratum is shown in Figure 3-4. The surface of the lower mud unit is interpreted to dip gently to the 20 southwest (PNNL-13652, 2001). 21 Hydrographs for selected wells near the IDF site are shown in Figures 3-5 and 3-6. Hydrographs for the 22 older wells (299-E23-1, 299-E23-2, and 299-E24-7) show two maxima in the water level. These coincide 23 with the operation of the PUREX Plant that operated between 1956 and 1972 and between 1983 and 24 1988. All the hydrographs show a decline in the water table during recent years. The rate of decline is 25 between 0.18 and 0.22 meters (7.08 and 8.66 inches)/year and will take between 10 and 30 years to 26 stabilize. The reason for the decline is the cessation of effluent discharge to the PUREX Plant and to the 27 216-B Pond System, centered northeast of 200 East area. Based on hindcast water table maps (PNNL, 28 BNWL-B-360), the water table is expected to decline another 2 to 7 meters (7 to 23 feet) before reaching 29 pre-Hanford Site elevations. The cessations of effluent discharge also are responsible for changing the 30 direction of groundwater flow across much of the 200 East area. 31 Groundwater flow beneath the IDF site recently was modeled to be southeasterly (PNNL-13400, 2000). 32 This direction differs from the easterly direction, predicted by the analysis of WHC-SD-WM-RPT-241 33 and other earlier reports. The southeasterly flow direction primarily is attributable to inclusion of the 34 highly permeable Hanford formation sediments in the ancestral Columbia River/Missoula flood channel 35 in the analysis. A southeasterly flow direction is reflected in the geographic distribution of the regional 36 nitrate and tritium plumes in the south-central 200 East area (Figure 3-7) (PNNL-1 3788, 2002.). As 37 stated in PNNL-13404 (2001), the water table gradient is too low to be used for determining flow 38 direction or flow rate at the PUREX Plant cribs, immediately east of the IDF site. 39 Hydraulic conductivity directly beneath the IDF site was estimated from data collected during four slug 40 tests at well 299-E17-21 and five slug tests of 299-E24-21. The interval tested at 299-El 7-21 was the 41 upper 7.8 meters (26 feet) of the unconfined aquifer from 101.3 to 109.1 meters (332 to 358 feet) depth. 42 That portion of the aquifer is Hanford formation gravel, from 101.3 to 102.1 meters (332 to 335 feet) 43 depth, and Ringold Formation unit E gravels, from 102.1 to 109.1 meters (335 to 358 feet) depth 44 (PNNL-12257, 1999). The interval tested at well 299-E24-21 was entirely in the Hanford formation 45 gravel sequence between 95.2 and 101.3 meters (312 and 332 feet) depth. The best-fit value to the data 46 from 299-E17-21 indicated a hydraulic conductivity of about 68.6 meters (225 feet) per day 47 (PNNL- 12257, 1999), and that from 299-E24-21 suggested a hydraulic conductivity of 75 meters 48 (246 feet) per day (PNNL-13652, 2001).

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4.0 SITE INVESTIGATION AND LABORATORY TEST PROGRAM 2 This section presents a summary of the existing, current, and planned explorations for the IDF, along with 3 the laboratory test results for tests conducted during this design effort. 4 4.1 Field Explorations 5 This section discusses the existing and current soil explorations for the IDF. The generalized soil profile 6 used in the analysis and design is presented; the engineering soil properties used for design are presented 7 and discussed in Section 5 and related appendices. 8 4.1.1 Existing Explorations 9 Several field explorations have been conducted in the general area of the IDF, as discussed in Section 10 3.4.1 and presented in Figure 3-1. Figure 1-2 shows the current IDF footprint and the closest borings to 11 the planned facility. As shown in Figure 1-2, with the exception of one boring, the existing explorations 12 are all outside of the footprint of the IDF. 13 The existing field explorations at the IDF site have been conducted primarily for geologic and 14 hydrogeologic characterization on a "big picture" scale. The existing explorations provide detailed 15 information for the purposes for which they were conducted; however, from a geotechnical engineering 16 perspective, the existing borings at or near the IDF site provides only general information, as discussed 17 below. 18 Depth of Interest-In many cases, the explorations focused on providing detailed information for the 19 entire soil column above the bedrock at the IDF site (300 or more feet below ground surface [bgs]). The 20 primary depth of interest for detailed engineering and design purposes is the depth of the planned cell 21 excavation (roughly 50 feet below the existing ground surface); for a few analyses, information about the 22 material 25 to 50 feet below the base of the excavation is also important. 23 Type of Information-As intended, the existing explorations was generally focused on providing 24 information for geologic characterization purposes. This focus differs from the key items generally 25 required for geotechnical design, including Standard Penetration Testing (SPT) per ASTM requirements 26 and classification by the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) in both the field and the laboratory. 27 For coarse-grained soils (sands and gravels), that make up the bulk of the native soil profile, in situ SPT 28 in conjunction with grain-size data is the primary basis for determining geotechnical engineering 29 parameters of the soil, such as shear strength. In all cases the SPT values were either not readily available 30 or were conducted with non-standard equipment. Also, the existing grain size data and soil 31 classifications, both for field and laboratory results were based on the Wentworth scale, which differs 32 from the USCS scale at the gravel and fines divisions. These are the key division points for classifying 33 coarse-grained soils. In particular, the break point for fines contents is important in determining the 34 suitability of the excavated soils for use in the admix liner as well as for other on-site filling purposes. 35 Many of the soils within the depth of interest for the IDF are near this classification break point. 36 Proximity to the IDF-As shown in Figure 1-2, in nearly all cases the explorations were located outside 37 of the IDF footprint. The standard of practice for geotechnical engineering is to place explorations within 38 or very close to the footprint of the proposed structure, if possible. 39 There have been several geotechnically focused explorations conducted for various projects at Hanford. 40 The projects closest and/or most applicable to the IDF site are: 41 The Grout Vault project, located approximately one-half mile east of the IDF site (Dames and Moore, 42 1988). 43 The W-025 Project, a radioactive mixed-waste land disposal facility designed in accordance with RCRA 44 Subtitle C design criteria, located several miles west of the IDF site (in Area 200W, Golder Associates, 45 1995, 1994a, 1994b, and 1988). 46 The RPP-WTP, location approximately 1 mile east of the IDF site (Shannon and Wilson, 2000 and 2001). Appendix 4A.1.37

--- Page 123 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I These projects all provide geotechnical engineering information; however, the closest site is one-half-mile 2 from the IDF. The standard of care for geotechnical engineering is to either use existing geotechnically 3 based information that is at the site and/or conduct site and project specific explorations. This is to verify 4 that the soil conditions at the site are either still valid (no changes since the time of the existing 5 explorations) or are consistent with existing data. 6 4.1.2 Current Explorations 7 Due to the limits of the geotechnical specific data, a subsurface exploration plan specific to the Phase I 8 portion of the IDF was proposed. The suggested locations for the exploration are shown in Figure 1-2. 9 This exploration is currently in planning. 10 During this design effort, a limited surface sampling plan was conducted at the locations shown in 11 Figure 1-2. The surface samples were taken from the upper 2 to 3 feet of soil, primarily to provide 12 samples for admix testing (to determine if the soils were suitable as a base soil), as well as to help fill in 13 for the absence of a full exploration program at the time of this design effort. As shown in Figure 1-2, 14 samples were taken from primarily from the dune sand borrow area within the IDF footprint (SD-1 15 through SD-4) and the active sand borrow area (SD-5) to the east of the IDF footprint. One surface 16 sample (SD-6) was obtained from within the IDF Phase I limits. 17 4.1.3 Site Stratigraphy 18 In the absence of a comprehensive site and project specific geotechnical engineering data, the existing and 19 current data discussed above was reviewed to determine appropriate soil profile and geotechnical 20 parameters for use in engineering analysis and design. The stratigraphy and soil properties were generally 21 selected conservatively to account for the uncertainty in the subsurface information. The general soil 22 stratigraphy beneath the Phase I section of the IDF was assumed to be: 23 * 10 feet of Dune (Eolian) sand, overlying 24 * 50 feet of Upper Hanford sand, overlying 25 Lower Hanford sand to depth of interest. 26 It is expected that a greater depth of Dune sand exists in the southern portion of the IDF footprint (note 27 topographic change in the southern one-third of the IDF footprint in Figure 1-2). 28 The engineering properties and parameters assumed for these soil units were based on the information 29 provided in the geotechnical reports listed in the previous section. The individual values are discussed in 30 Section 5 and related appendices. 31 4.1.4 Future Explorations 32 It is recommended that a comprehensive, geotechnically focused exploration program be completed, prior 33 to construction, to verify that the assumptions made for soil stratigraphy and engineering properties are 34 valid. A more comprehensive set of explorations is currently being planned. The planned locations for 35 the additional explorations are shown in Figure 1-2, and include three explorations within the Phase I 36 footprint and one exploration in the proposed sand borrow area. 37 4.2 Laboratory Testing 38 A limited laboratory testing program was conducted, using the soils collected during the surface sampling 39 program discussed in Section 4.1.3. These samples were used to perform the index testing, admix testing, 40 and geosynthetics interface shear testing. 41 4.2.1 Index Testing 42 Index testing was performed to evaluate the basic index and classification properties of the soil obtained 43 from surface sampling program. This testing was conducted to provide data for comparison with both the 44 soils used for the W025 admix liner and also for other soils that are considered for use as the base soil for 45 the IDF project, as the final design and construction proceeds. Appendix 4A.1.38

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The laboratory testing was conducted by Soil Technology, Inc., (STI) of Bainbridge Island, Washington, 2 under subcontract to the Affiliate. Test assignment and coordination was provided by the Affiliate. Index 3 testing included the following ASTM tests: 4 * ASTM D422 -Test Method for Particle-Size Analysis of Soils (grain size and hydrometer 5 analyses) 6 * ASTM D698 -Test Method for Laboratory Compaction Characteristics of Soil Using Standard 7 Effort 8 * ASTM D 1140 -Test Method for Amount of Material in Soils Finer then the No. 200 Sieve (P200 9 Wash) 10 * ASTM D1557 -Test Method for Laboratory Compaction Characteristics of Soil Using Modified 11 Efforts 12 * ASTM D2216 -Test Method for Laboratory Determination of Water (Moisture) Content of Soil 13 and Rock 14 * Compaction characteristics were also determined for a composite of the surface soils, as 15 described in the next section. 16 4.2.2 Admix Testing Program 17 The admix testing program was developed to determine two key items: 18 * Percentage of sodium bentonite required to meet hydraulic conductivity requirements 19 * Appropriate moisture and density parameters to achieve the required hydraulic conductivity 20 Index testing of the admix soils was also conducted, as well as a consolidation test. The laboratory 21 testing was conducted by STI. Tests were run in general accordance with the following: 22 * ASTM D422 -Test Method for Particle-Size Analysis of Soils (grain size and hydrometer 23 analyses) 24 * ASTM D698B -Test Method for Laboratory Compaction Characteristics of Soil Using Standard 25 Effort 26 * ASTM D1557 -Test Method for Laboratory Compaction Characteristics of Soil Using Modified 27 Efforts 28 * ASTM D2216 -Test Method for Laboratory Determination of Water (Moisture) Content of Soil 29 and Rock 30 * ASTM D2435 -Test Method for One-dimensional Consolidation Properties of Soils 31 * ASTM D4318 -Test Method for Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit, and Plasticity Index of Soils 32 (Atterberg Limits) 33 * ASTM D5084 -Test Method for Measurement of Hydraulic Conductivity of Saturated Porous 34 Materials Using a Flexible Wall Permeameter 35 The base soil for the admix testing was created by compositing SD-I through SD-4 from the surface 36 sampling program. This composite did not include SD-5, taken at the base of the existing sand borrow 37 area (lower elevation than the other samples) that has slightly different properties than the remainder of 38 the surface samples. SD-6 was not included at the time of the admix testing because it is not within the 39 footprint of the planned borrow area. The base composite sample was labeled as COMP-1. This 40 composite was then used to create the two other soils for admix testing: 41 * COMP-2: COMP-1 base soil mixed with 8 percent bentonite 42 * COMP-3: COMP-1 base soil mixed with 12 percent bentonite 43 * Moisture and density testing was conducted on all of the composite samples. 44 Appendix 4A.1.39

--- Page 125 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I The initial hydraulic conductivity testing was conducted using eight and 12 percent bentonite (by weight), 2 based on the results of the admix testing program conducted by Golder for the W025 Project (Golder, 3 1991 b). The target laboratory hydraulic conductivity was less than 10-8 cm/sec when permeated with 4 water. Testing was not conducted with leachate, as no actual leachate exists for the planned waste at this 5 time. Golder Associates used a synthetic leachate to perform compatibility testing on the admix liner. 6 Based on these results, they increased the bentonite percentage from 8 to 12 percent, hence the use of 7 these values in these tests. Because the base soils are expected to be similar to that used by Golder for the 8 W025 landfill, and until a more refined characterization of the IDF leachate is developed, the 9 compatibility testing performed for the W025 project was considered applicable to the IDF project. 10 Hydraulic conductivity testing was performed on all samples in flexible wall triaxial cells with 11 backpressure saturation, in general accordance with ASTM D5084. An effective confining stress of 12 5 pounds per square in (psi) was applied to each test cell. Appendix B.1 includes the details for the test, 13 including the inflow and outflow data used to confirm that each test had obtained a steady-state hydraulic 14 conductivity value. 15 After the initial hydraulic conductivity testing was completed, additional samples were set up to 16 determine the range of moisture and density parameters that are expected to produce the required 17 hydraulic conductivity in the field. 18 As noted above, the samples used for the testing were gathered from the surface sampling program. Once 19 a more comprehensive exploration program is conducted within the IDF footprint, the suitability of the 20 soils within the excavation below a depth of 5 feet (upper 2-3 feet) can be examined for use as a base soil 21 for the admix. 22 4.2.3 Geosynthetics Interface Shear Testing 23 A limited soil-to-geosynthetic interface shear testing program was conducted to determine the interface 24 shear values between the operations soil and the composite drainage net (CDN), and the admix liner soils 25 and the high-density polyethylene (HDPE). These interfaces are site specific because of the unique nature 26 of the soils, hence their behavior in interface shear. The testing was conducted by Precision Geotechnical 27 Laboratories in Anaheim, California. Soil samples collected during the surface sampling program were 28 used for testing; GSE Lining Technologies, Inc. based in Houston, Texas provided the geosynthetics for 29 testing. 30 The interface shear tests were conducted in general accordance with ASTM D5321-Standard Test 31 Method for Determining the Coefficient of Soil and Geosynthetic or Geosynthetic and Geosynthetic 32 Friction by the Direct Shear Method. The tests were conducted for both low (100 to 500 psf) and high 33 (1000 to 8000 psf) normal stress levels, to account for the variation in normal stresses that will be applied 34 across the lining system in the final landfill configuration. Both the peak and residual strength values 35 were determined during testing. Additional details for the tests are presented with the test results in 36 Appendix B.2. 37 Asperity testing was also conducted on the textured HDPE geomembrane, in general accordance with 38 GRI-GM12 -Asperity Height of Textured Geomembrane. The purpose of the asperity testing was to 39 establish a baseline roughness of the texturing of the HDPE geomembrane and for future assessments of 40 the interface shear strength of other textured HDPE geomembrane products (e.g., from other 41 manufacturers). 42 Site-specific interface shear testing was not conducted for geosynthetic-to-geosynthetic (such as CDN to 43 geosynthetic clay liner [GCL]) interfaces in this phase of design, as these values are primarily a function 44 of the manufactured product properties. A database of values for geosynthetic-to-geosynthetic interface 45 testing was used to determine the appropriate interface shear values for design. During construction, the 46 actual materials used on the site will be tested as part of the construction QC/QA, to ensure that the 47 installed materials used onsite meet or exceed the interface shear strength values used in the design.

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4.3 Laboratory Test Results 2 The results of the laboratory testing programs are summarized below and presented in Appendix B.l and 3 Appendix B.2. 4 4.3.1 Index Testing 5 The results of the index testing for the surface samples are presented in Table 4-1. The test results are 6 included with the admix liner soils test results in Appendix B.1. Results of the index testing indicate that 7 the grain size analyses for near-surface soil samples from locations SD-I through SD-6 correlate well 8 with data from the W025 base soil material. The W025 base soil was a dune sand (Eolian deposits) 9 obtained from the upper 15 feet of site excavations. As discussed in Section 5.4, based on the results 10 shown below and due to the limited nature of the near surface soil samples, the base soil is limited to the 11 upper 5 feet of material excavated from the dune sand borrow area or the Phase I site excavation.

Engineering analysis components for each of these critical systems is presented in this 12 section. A general description of system components is located in Section 5.6.1, that presents the primary 13 and secondary liner systems that make up the major layers of the landfill (detailed system descriptions are 14 presented in Section 6). 15 In preparation of the IDF design, a number of design requirements and criteria as presented in Section 2 16 have been considered. Compliance with these design requirements is provided in Appendix A. The 17 specific criteria evaluated for the IDF design included: 18 * Slope stability 19 * Landfill bearing capacity 20 * Settlement and uplift analyses 21 * Admix liner 22 * Geosynthetic liner design 23 * Liner systems/leachate compatibility 24 * Drainage layer 25 * Leachate production 26 * Leachate collection system 27 * Surface stormwater Appendix 4A.1.43

--- Page 129 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Action leakage rate 2 * Building systems analyses 3 * Civil grading 4 5.1 Slope Stability 5 Slope stability for the IDF landfill was examined for liner veneer (side slope) stability, earthwork 6 stability, waste/fill global stability. The analyses for each of these cases are summarized in the sections 7 below; Appendices C.1.a through C. I.c presents the analyses and results in detail. 8 5.1.1 Liner Veneer (Side Slope) Stability 9 The veneer stability of the liner system on the side slopes was evaluated for the period prior to waste 10 filling. The analysis examined the potential for sliding of the drainage and operations layers on the liner 11 system before waste is placed. 12 The analyses were conducted using the weakest of the interface strengths of the various lining system 13 components. The interface strengths were determined from regression analyses of data gathered from 14 various sources, including site-specific test data completed to date. Based on the data (presented in 15 Appendix C. .a), the critical interface is the textured HDPE/CDN interface. Properties of the cover soil 16 (operations layer) were determined from laboratory testing to date on the materials expected to be used 17 for the operations layer. 18 Four loading conditions were examined: 19 * Dead load: self-weight of the lining system (including the first operations layer) 20 * Dead load + Equipment: self-weight of the lining system with an equipment load 21 * Dead load + Seepage: self-weight of the lining system with a seepage load (to account for fluid 22 head in the leachate collection system); seepage loads were based on results from the leachate 23 system hydraulic analyses 24 * Seismic Loading: self-weight of the lining system with seismic loading 25 The results of the analyses show that the lining system is stable for the conditions analyzed and no 26 anchorage forces are required to meet the minimum factors of safety (1.5 for dead load only; 1.3 for 27 equipment and seepage loading). A minimum interface friction of 25 degrees and cohesion of 0 psf is 28 required to meet the minimum acceptable factors of safety. The slopes are also considered to be stable 29 under seismic loading, based on comparing the calculated yield acceleration and with the design 30 acceleration values provided in the design criteria by CH2M HILL (September, 2002), using the hazard 31 classification assigned to the overall facility. 32 The critical interface friction values will be verified during construction to ensure that the system will be 33 stable. The analyses and results are presented in full detail in Appendix C. I.a. 34 5.1.2 Earthwork Stability 35 The earthwork stability analysis covered the following three cases: 36 Excavation Case: This case covers the stability of the landfill slopes immediately after excavation and 37 before placement of the lining system. Only static loading was considered since this is an interim 38 configuration that will only exist for the construction period. 39 Ramp Case: This case covers the stability of the landfill slopes and access ramp at the south end of the 40 cell, including equipment loading on the ramps. Both static and seismic loading were examined, as the 41 access ramps are expected to be in use for a period of at least 10 years. 42 Dike Case: This case covers the stability of the perimeter dike (shine berm and access road) after 43 construction of the dike and before final closure of the landfill. Appendix 4A.1.44

--- Page 130 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Both static and seismic loading were examined, since the perimeter dike may be in place until the final 2 cover system is completed (greater than 10 years). 3 Properties for the native soils are based on existing information, as a site-specific geotechnical 4 engineering investigation program has not yet been completed for the IDF facility. When this 5 investigation is completed, the results of this analysis (and any others that rely on the properties of the 6 native soils) will be verified. Geometry used in the analyses is based on the civil plans (generally 3H:1V 7 slopes with a few short 2H:1V slopes). 8 The results of the analyses show that the planned configurations of the landfill are stable under static 9 loading (factor of safety [FS] greater than 1.3 and 1.5, depending on the case analyzed); the 10 configurations are also considered seismically stable based on the criteria for the Hanford site. Full 11 details on the analysis method, the input data, and the results are presented in Appendix C. I.b. 12 5.1.3 Waste/Fill Global Stability 13 This analysis examined the following conditions: 14 Phase I Full Build-Out: This case examined the stability of the waste mass in full build-out of the Phase 15 1 waste cell. The critical stability examined was the waste sliding on the lining system. Both static and 16 seismic loading conditions were examined. 17 Final Configuration: This case examined the stability of the waste mass at the final configuration (entire 18 IDF landfill completed) along the edge of the cover system. Only static loading conditions were 19 examined, since this system is not being designed as part of the current effort. 20 Interim filling conditions and the internal stability of the waste mass were not examined. The internal 21 waste mass stability will primarily be a function of the filling methodology. Possible filling plans for the 22 waste are currently being developed. 23 For the analysis of the full build-out of Phase I, the critical interface strengths in the lining system were 24 determined in the same way as for the veneer stability (regression analyses of existing and site specific 25 testing data). A combination of peak and residual strengths were used, based on methodology currently 26 being employed in the state of the practice. A final check was also made to confirm that the use of 27 residual strengths in all locations resulted in a factor of safety greater than 1.0. 28 The results show that the system is stable for the configurations analyzed and for the interface friction 29 values available at the time of the analyses (FS greater than 1.5 in static loading and yield acceleration 30 greater than the 10,000-year event). The system also has a FS greater than 1.0 for the case of residual 31 strengths in all locations. The critical interfaces are the HDPE-CDN on the side slopes (using residual 32 strengths) and the HDPE-GCL on the base liner (using peak strengths) and the internal GCL strength 33 (using residual strengths). These results should be verified when additional site-specific test data 34 becomes available prior to and during construction. 35 Also, it should be noted that for the full Phase I build-out configuration, the most critical case appears to 36 be a failure surface that is allowed to propagate through the waste mass. As noted previously, the waste 37 mass was considered internally stable for this design effort. During final operations planning, the internal 38 stability of the waste will be examined in conjunction with the proposed waste filling plan. 39 For the final configuration with the cover in place, the preliminary geometry and assumed cover system 40 properties show that the configuration is stable under static loading (FS greater than 1.5) and the critical 41 failure does not intersect the waste mass. Stability of the final configuration under both static and seismic 42 loading should be examined in more detail as the final design develops for the final closure of the entire 43 IDF facility. 44 A full discussion of the methodology, input data, and the results is presented in Appendix C.I.c. Appendix 4A. 1.45

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 5.2 Landfill Bearing Capacity 2 5.2.1 Subgrade Soil 3 Based on the available geotechnical data from other projects (as discussed in Section 4), the strength of 4 the native subgrade soils beneath the landfill is expected to be greater than that for the operations layer or 5 any of the liner system components. Greater strengths equate to higher bearing capacities, and hence, the 6 bearing capacity of the subgrade soils within the landfill cell was not determined directly as they are not 7 the controlling factor. 8 The bearing capacity of the subgrade soils beneath the supporting structures adjacent to the landfill cell 9 was determined for the structural analyses, discussed under Section 5.12.1-Geotechnical Design 10 Parameters, and the results of the analyses are presented in Appendix C.1 l.a. 11 5.2.2 Liner Soils 12 The soil layers in the lining system include the operations layer, drain gravel, and the admix liner soils. 13 The admix liner soils will be placed beneath the geosynthetic lining system, and as such, loading on the 14 admix liner soils is limited to the allowable loads for the GCL. The allowable loads for the GCL are 15 much less than what the bearing capacity of the admix liner soils would be (the admix soils have much 16 higher strengths, particularly for bearing pressures). The drain gravel will be placed just above the lining 17 system; the shear strength and associated bearing capacity are also much greater than the GCL allowable 18 values. 19 At the time of these calculations, structures that would cause bearing pressure were not yet determined. 20 Hence, the bearing capacity for the operations soils was calculated for foundation widths from I to 10 feet 21 and for 2 different shapes (square and strip). Properties for the operations soils were based on laboratory 22 testing conducted to date; these properties will be verified during construction to ensure that the analyses 23 results are valid. 24 For a factor of safety of 3, the allowable bearing capacities for the operations layer are presented in 25 Table 5-1. Table 5-1. Operations Soil Bearing Capacities B, Foundation Width (feet) gall, square foundation (tsf) ga1, strip foundation (tsf) 1 0.20 0.33 5 1.0 1.6 10 2.0 3.3 26 As the operations plans are further developed, these values can be updated for the planned structures 27 (such as barrier walls). Details of the analyses are presented in Appendix C.2. 28 5.3 Settlement and Uplift Analyses 29 5.3.1 Settlement Analysis of Liner Foundation 30 The long term settlement of the soils supporting the geosynthetic liner system was estimated based on the 31 maximum loading expected in the landfill at the final IDF completion. The two soil units examined were 32 the admix liner soils and the native subgrade soils. For the admix soils, data from laboratory 33 consolidation testing performed on samples available at the time of the analysis were used to determine 34 the estimated settlements. Elastic methods were used to estimate the settlements of the subgrade soils. 35 As detailed in Appendix C.3, the estimated long term settlement over the lifetime of the landfill is 2.7 feet 36 under the maximum loading. 37 5.3.2 Subsidence and Sinkhole Potential 38 Subsidence of undisturbed foundation materials is generally the result of dissolution, fluid extraction 39 (water or petroleum), or mining. Subsidence is not expected to occur based on the following: Appendix 4A.1.46

--- Page 132 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * The soils underlying the IDF are generally dense, coarse-grained, and well-graded sands and 2 gravels that will not be subject to piping effects that could transport soil and result in subsidence. 3 Also, sands and gravels are generally not susceptible to dissolution. 4 * The groundwater level is deep and will not affect bearing soils. 5 * The bedrock is basalt (volcanic), which is not generally susceptible to dissolution. 6 * No mining or tunneling has been reported in the areas beneath or surrounding the site for the IDF. 7 * Borings in and around the IDF have not identified any soluble materials in the foundation soils or 8 underlying sediments. Consequently, the potential for any sinkhole development will be 9 negligible. 10 5.3.3 Uplift Potential 11 The potential for uplift of the composite liner system is very low. The seasonal high-water level is over 12 200 feet below the base of the base of the landfill cell, so no external hydrostatic pressure is expected 13 from this source. Perched groundwater is not expected to occur due to the absence of continuous 14 aquitards (such as a clay layer) within the coarse-grained native soils at the IDF site. Any infiltration that 15 does occur is expected to percolate rapidly to deeper soil layers. 16 Gas pressures are also expected to be negligible, as no gas-generating material (i.e., organic material) is 17 expected in the foundation soils. Also, the subgrade soils are coarse grained and unsaturated, so any gas 18 that might occur is expected to be rapidly dissipated. 19 5.4 Admix Liner 20 5.4.1 Mix Design 21 WAC 173-303-665(2)(h)(i)(B) requires that the lower component of a composite bottom liner be 22 constructed of compacted soil material with an in-situ hydraulic conductivity no greater than 10-7 cm/sec. 23 Because of the lack of naturally occurring soils on-site that could achieve this requirement, a test program 24 was developed to determine the admixture requirements for a mixed soil design using on-site base soil 25 from either the Phase I excavation or dune sand borrow area (see Drawing H-2-830826 for location) and 26 sodium bentonite. Details of the base soil field exploration and admix testing program are provided in 27 Section 4. 28 The results of the limited field exploration for base soil samples and subsequent admix testing program 29 discussed in Section 4 show that a nominal bentonite content of 12 percent will meet the laboratory target 30 hydraulic conductivity of less than 10-8 cm/sec when permeated with water. The laboratory target was 31 established based on results of the soil liner/leachate compatibility study (Golder Associates, 1991b) for 32 the W025 landfill. Details of Golder's study are discussed in Section 5.6. The W025 study concluded 33 that the bentonite content of the admix should be increased from 8 percent (the minimum bentonite 34 percent needed to achieve the required hydraulic conductivity) to 12 percent, to provide adequate 35 resistance against high inorganic concentrations in the synthetic leachate for the W025 project. Index 36 laboratory testing on the limited field exploration at the IDF site (surface sampling) established that the 37 base soil for the IDF was similar to the W-025 project, as discussed in Section 4. Thus, until a more 38 refined characterization of the IDF leachate is developed, the compatibility testing from the W025 testing 39 is applicable to the IDF mix design. 40 Once initial hydraulic testing confirmed that an admix with 12 percent bentonite content could achieve 41 the laboratory target value, additional samples were set up to evaluate a range of moisture and density 42 parameters and their effect on hydraulic conductivity. The additional hydraulic conductivity tests were 43 performed to define moisture content-density requirements for a range of compactive energy, as outlined 44 by Daniel and Benson (1990). This data was being used to develop an "acceptable" zone of moisture and 45 density for use by QC personnel during construction. The acceptable zone for the 12 percent admix is 46 presented along with the admix design laboratory test results in Appendix B. 1. Appendix 4A. 1.47

--- Page 133 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I The acceptable zone was developed based on samples that achieved a hydraulic conductivity of less than 2 10-8 cm/sec. A lower bound of 95 percent relative compaction, based on Standard Proctor (ASTM D698) 3 compactive effort, was established to ensure adequate shear strength levels. As indicated in the technical 4 specifications (see Section 02666), the moisture-density range of the compacted admixes shall lie within a 5 trapezoidal-shaped field with the following comers: Moisture Content % Dry Density (pcf) 8 126 14 126 12 110 19 110 6 Note that the minimum dry density of 110 listed above corresponds to approximately 95 percent of the 7 maximum dry density for admix, as measured by ASTM D698. 8 5.4.2 Placement and Testing 9 The moisture-density requirements developed as part of the admix testing program will be included in the 10 specifications for the admix liner (see discussion in Section 5.4.1, and technical specifications, 11 Section 02666). The intent of the placement technical specifications is to help ensure that the admix liner 12 will meet an in-place performance specification for hydraulic conductivity of less than l x10-7 cm/sec. 13 The contractor is responsible for developing and implementing compaction means and methods that will 14 produce the required relative compaction. 15 The recommended nominal bentonite percentage (12 percent) and moisture-density parameters for the 16 admix liner have been developed with a one order of magnitude factor of safety between laboratory and 17 field values for hydraulic conductivity. The factor of safety is expected to account for two issues: (1) 18 variations in the hydraulic conductivity between the laboratory soil amendment study and full-scale 19 production, and (2) the laboratory samples were permeated with water rather than leachate, which could 20 lead to a difference in the field hydraulic conductivity. However, factors such as base soil variability at 21 the borrow source and field placement and construction are difficult to quantify until full-scale production 22 begins for the admix liner. A test pad will be constructed as part the IDF construction to model the full- 23 scale production. The purpose of the test pad is to determine acceptable processing, placement, and 24 compaction methods that will produce a low-hydraulic conductivity admix liner with an in situ hydraulic 25 conductivity of 10-7 cm/sec or less. The bentonite percentage and moisture content/density range may be 26 modified if the preconstruction testing performed on the test pad indicates an in situ hydraulic 27 conductivity greater than 10-7 cm/sec. Construction QA sampling and testing for the test pad is described 28 in the Detailed Design Cell 1 Construction QA Plan (CH2M HILL, March 2004). 29 5.4.3 Freeze/Thaw 30 Compacted soil liners, such as the IDF admix liner, are known to be vulnerable to large increases in 31 hydraulic conductivity due to freeze/thaw cycling; current data suggests that compacted soil bentonite 32 admixtures may not be as vulnerable to damage as true clay liners (Kim and Daniel, 1992; Benson and 33 Othman, 1993; Kraus et al., 1997). Existing laboratory data indicate that GCLs are less susceptible to 34 damage from freeze/thaw conditions and therefore, do not undergo increases in hydraulic conductivity 35 (Hewitt and Daniel, 1997; Kraus et al., 1997). 36 In order to provide adequate freeze/thaw protection for the admix liner and avoid potential damage to the 37 GCL a protective soil cover can be used. The thickness of the protective soil cover should exceed the 38 predicted freeze depth. For the IDF, protective soil cover is provided by the operations layer on the side 39 slope (3 feet) and the drain gravel and operation layer (4 feet total) on the bottom liner. 40 The analysis was performed on the IDF lining system operations layer to determine the freeze depth or 41 frost penetration for a probable freezing season during the 10-year expected period of waste filling. 42 Appendix 4A. 1.48

--- Page 134 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Both a 10-year return period (90 percent probability on non-exceedance) and 20-year return period (95 2 percent probability on non-exceedance) air freeze index (AFI) were used to estimate maximum frost 3 penetration depth in the operations layer. If the maximum frost penetration depth were less than the 3- 4 foot minimum thickness operations layer over the lining system, the proposed operations layer thickness 5 would be considered as adequate protection for exposure of the lining system to freeze-thaw cycles. 6 For the 10-year return AFI, the maximum freeze depth is estimated at 17 inches. For the 20-year return 7 AFI, the maximum freeze depth is estimated at 21 inches. The maximum estimated freeze depths for both 8 the 10-year and 20-year return period freezing seasons indicate that the proposed cover soil thicknesses 9 provide more than adequate protection for the underlying admix liner and GCL from potential damage 10 when subject to freeze-thaw cycles. Details of the freeze depth calculations are included in 11 Appendix C.4. 12 5.5 Geosynthetic Liner Design 13 5.5.1 Geomembrane Liner Tension Caused By Thermal Contraction 14 The HDPE geomembrane for IDF lining system will be subject to temperature-induced tensile strain from 15 expansion/contraction as the geomembrane is exposed to temperature fluctuation. 16 Strain on the liner was calculated using published values for the coefficient of linear thermal expansion 17 for HDPE geomembrane (Koerner, 1998) and applying this to the maximum slope length. The maximum 18 length is measured from the top of the slope, where liner is anchored, to the toe of the 3H:IV side slope. 19 This is a conservative approach, as using the maximum slope length results in the maximum amount of 20 expansion and strain on the liner. Additionally, a conservative temperature change of 40 degrees C 21 (104 degrees F) was used in the analysis. 22 The maximum liner strain was estimated to be less than 0.5 percent, based on a maximum temperature 23 change of 40 degrees C (104 degrees F). The estimated maximum of slack in the liner on the side slope is 24 8.6 inches. The corresponding amount of temperature induced stress is 566 psi. See Appendix C.5.a for 25 supporting calculations. 26 As shown in the technical specifications, Section 02661 (Table 1), the elongation at yield for the 27 geomembrane that will be used in the liner system is at least 12 percent, with a minimum tensile strength 28 at yield of 2,000 psi. Therefore, the maximum anticipated strains are well below the yield tensile strain 29 and stress for the HDPE geomembrane, and temperature-induced strain will have no adverse impact on 30 lining system function. 31 It should be noted that temperature-induced strain is only applicable during the construction period when 32 the HDPE geomembrane is exposed to temperature fluctuation. Once covered with 3 to 4 feet of cover 33 soils (drain gravel and operations layer), the ambient temperature at the surface of the geomembrane will 34 be more controlled and not subject to fluctuation. 35 During installation, care must be taken to allow for expansion/contraction of the HDPE geomembrane to 36 minimize the development of wrinkles that could become future stress points under soil and waste 37 loading. The technical specifications (see Section 02661) provide requirements for control of wrinkle 38 development during liner deployment, including the limitation of working when the temperature is below 39 0 degrees C (32 degrees F) or above 40 degrees C (104 degrees F) without implementing installation 40 procedures that address the environmental conditions. 41 5.5.2 Liner System Strain Due To Settlement 42 The barrier components (geomembrane and GCL) for the IDF lining system will be subject to settlement- 43 induced tensile strains as the underlying soils, primarily the admix soil liner and the subgrade soil, settle 44 over time. Strain within the lining system was calculated based on the results of the liner foundation 45 settlement calculations (see Section 5.3 for settlement of foundation soil [subgrade] and admix liner). Appendix 4A. 1.49

--- Page 135 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The strain calculation assumed that all vertical settlement was translated into strain along the liner rather 2 than just the vector component parallel to the liner. This is a conservative assumption that establishes an 3 upper bound for liner strain. 4 The maximum liner strain was estimated to be less than 0.6 percent, based on a maximum estimate of 5 2.7 feet of settlement at the base of the lining system. See Appendix C.5.b for supporting calculations. 6 As shown the technical specification (Section 02661, Table 1), the elongation at yield for the 7 geomembrane that will be used in the liner system is at least 12 percent. Based on studies of effect of 8 differential settlement on GCLs (LaGatta et al., 1997), the limiting strain was defined as the strain in 9 which an increase in hydraulic conductivity of the GCL was observed, which was taken as 5 percent. 10 Therefore, the maximum anticipated strains are well below the yield or limiting tensile strain for the 11 barrier components of the lining system (geomembrane and GCL). Settlement-induced strain from 12 foundation and admix soil settlement under maximum landfill content pressure will have no adverse 13 impact on lining system function. 14 5.5.3 Anchor Trench Pullout Resistance 15 During construction, the geomembrane could experience pullout forces caused by thermal 16 expansion/contraction or wind uplift. However, tension from thermal expansion and contraction is 17 expected to be small (see Section 5.5.1), and the geosynthetics installer can use sand bags or other 18 approved method to control wind uplift during installation. 19 After construction and placement of operation layer, the pullout forces on the geomembrane are expected 20 to be negligible, as there is no tension force on the liner. As indicated in the veneer (side slope) stability 21 analyses (see Section 5.1.1), the lining system interface strength exceeds the slope angle on the 3H: IV 22 side slope. Thus, the pullout resistance requirements for the anchor trench are to support the self-weight 23 of the geomembrane and other lining system components. Analyses for liner self-weight support 24 requirements determined that the frictional resistance between geosynthetics exceeds the liner self-weight. 25 Thus, no additional pullout resistance is needed at the anchor trench to support lining system self-weight. 26 Supporting calculations for the anchor trench design, as shown on Drawing H-2-830838, Detail 3, are 27 included in Appendix C.5.c. Based on the calculations for the configuration shown in the drawing, a 28 pullout resistance ranging from 1840 pound/foot (lb/ft) to 2440 lb/ft is estimated (depending on actual 29 mobilized interface shear strength). The required minimum tensile yield strength for 60-mil HDPE 30 geomembrane in the technical specifications (see Section 02661) is 1440 lb/ft (120 lb/in), which results in 31 the estimated pullout resistance exceeding the geomembrane tensile yield strength. This situation is due 32 primarily to the configuration of the shine berm, which helps to anchor the system. While it is generally 33 not desired for the pullout resistance to exceed the yield strength, this is not expected to be a problem at 34 the IDF, since, as discussed above, the potential causes for geomembrane tension have been addressed 35 and there is not a scenario for mobilizing tensile or pullout forces on the lining system. 36 5.5.4 Puncture Resistance 37 The primary geomembrane in the IDF will be overlain by the LCRS. For the side slope lining system, the 38 LCRS consists of a CDN (see Detail 2 on Drawing H-2-830838) that provides protection for the primary 39 geomembrane from the overlying operations layer. A separate discussion of the CDN geotextile puncture 40 resistance is provided in Section 5.7.2. For the bottom lining (floor) system, the LCRS consists of drain 41 gravel overlying the geomembrane (see Detail I on Drawing H-2-830838). A geotextile cushion will be 42 required between the drainage gravel and the geomembrane to prevent the gravel from puncturing the 43 geomembrane. An analysis was performed to determine the weight of the geotextile fabric required to 44 prevent geomembrane puncture either from operating equipment loads or from the combined static weight 45 of the waste and final cover. 46 Appendix 4A.1.50

--- Page 136 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Koerner (1998) developed a method for estimating required geotextile thickness that considers the size 2 and shape of the rock, as well as other factors that could decrease the long-term strength of the 3 geomembrane. The equation used to determine puncture resistance is based on the mass per unit area of 4 the geotextile and the protrusion height of the puncturing material. 5 Operating loads were estimated based on a melter transport trailer operating directly on the surface of the 6 first operations layer. Static loads were estimated for the post-closure condition by using the weight of 7 four layers of ILAW packages with cover soil and a 15-foot-thick closure cover, with a 2 percent grade to 8 the center of the landfill. The static load was more than two times greater than the operating load, and 9 therefore was used as the basis for the puncture analysis. Detail calculations for geomembrane puncture 10 resistance and corresponding cushion geotextile requirements are included in Appendix C.5.d. 11 The proposed design specifies that the LCRS drainage gravel will have a gradation corresponding to 12 WSDOT Standard Specification 9-03.12(4). This gradation has a maximum stone size of I inch. From 13 the curves shown in the detailed calculations, the FS for a 12 oz/yd2 geotextile loaded by 1-inch angular 14 rock is 4.5. For subrounded rock or gravel, this is more representative of the specified drain gravel, the 15 FS increases to 8.9. The specified cushion geotextile (see technical specifications, Section 02371) has a 16 nominal weight of 12 oz/sq yd, and therefore should be adequate to prevent geomembrane puncture. 17 Koerner (1998) recommends a FS greater than 3.0 for the condition of packed stones on a geomembrane, 18 such as would be the case for drain gravel over the geomembrane at the IDF. 19 5.5.5 Operational/Equipment Loading 20 The effects of loading on the GCL from construction and operational equipment and activities were 21 examined. The maximum loads from the landfill waste itself were found to produce the highest loading 22 on the geomembrane and the CDN; these materials were selected based on this maximum loading, as 23 discussed in the previous sections. 24 The cases for construction equipment loading and operational loading on the GCL were examined, 25 including the extreme loading case of the crane placing the heaviest waste loads at its maximum reach, a 26 situation which produces very high pad loads. The expected loads were compared to the calculated 27 allowable GCL bearing capacity to determine if the loads would have an effect on the GCL. The 28 allowable GCL bearing capacity was determined from classical geotechnical theory and based on 29 manufacturer's strength data. 30 The results of the analyses are presented in detail in Appendix C.5.e. For the construction loading, the 31 analyses show that the specification requirements that limit construction loading are adequate to protect 32 the GCL, based on the standard construction equipment anticipated to be used at the IDF and as examined 33 in the calculations. 34 For the operational loading cases examined, the critical condition is the crane operating under an extreme 35 condition. The minimum dunnage requirement for the crane pads is 60 square feet, or if square, a 7.7-foot 36 by 7.7-foot dunnage pad. Lower loads will require less dunnage and can be calculated as detailed in 37 Appendix C.5.e. As discussed in the appendix, dunnage requirements calculated in this way are 38 appropriate as long as the lining system is functioning as intended (i.e., no moisture in the LDS). If 39 moisture enters the LDS and the GCL becomes hydrated, the dunnage requirements will be increased by a 40 factor of approximately 2.5. 41 It should also be noted that the primary purpose of the GCL in the IDF is not as a required lining system 42 component (such as the geomembrane or the admix liner), but to "deflect" leachate from defects or 43 pinholes in the primary geomembrane over the bottom area and longer-term storage areas (such as 44 leachate sump trough), where the leachate head potential is greatest. The primary purpose of the primary 45 GCL is to reduce the actual leakage rate into the LDS in the event of leak in the primary geomembrane. 46 Given these considerations, the GCL should perform as intended under anticipated equipment and 47 operational loading. Appendix 4A.1.51

--- Page 137 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I As the operations plans for the landfill are developed, loading values can be compared to the results 2 shown in Appendix C.5.e to determine if the loads will affect the GCL. 3 5.6 Liner Systems/Leachate Compatibility 4 The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate that the liner materials proposed for the IDF landfill are 5 chemically compatible with the leachate. Certain materials deteriorate over time when exposed to 6 chemicals that may be contained in hazardous leachate. It is important to anticipate the type and quality 7 of the leachate that the landfill will generate and select compatible liner materials. Data collected from 8 other similar low-level radioactive mixed waste and hazardous waste sites were used in conjunction with 9 the anticipated IDF leachate concentrations to evaluate the allowable concentration of leachate 10 constituents that could be in contact with the IDF landfill liner components. 11 5.6.1 Lining System Description 12 Detailed discussion of the lining system design elements is provided in Section 6. A summary is 13 provided in this section to facilitate discussion with respect to the chemical and radiation resistance of the 14 lining system components. 15 Drawing H-2-830838 (Detail 1) shows the bottom liner section consisting of the following components, 16 from top to bottom: 17 * A 3-foot-thick operations layer 18 * A separation geotextile (polypropylene) 19 * A 1-foot-thick leachate gravel layer 20 * A minimum 12 oz/square yard cushion geotextile (polypropylene) 21 * A 60-mil (nominal thickness-see Section 6.3.2.1) textured primary HDPE geomembrane 22 * An internally-reinforced GCL 23 * A CDN drainage layer for primary leak detection/collection 24 * A 60-mil textured secondary HDPE geomembrane 25 * A 3-foot-thick low-hydraulic conductivity compacted admix (soil-bentonite) liner 26 For the bottom lining system, both the primary and secondary liners are a composite (geomembrane over 27 admix liner or GCL) system. The addition of a GCL in the primary liner layer provides an extra measure 28 of protection, exceeding the requirements of WAC 173-303-665(2)(h)(i), which stipulates a single 29 geomembrane for the primary liner and composite for the secondary only. This will provide an extra 30 measure of protection on the bottom flatter slopes of the IDF, where higher leachate head levels are more 31 likely. 32 Drawing H-2-830838 (Detail 2) shows the side slope liner section consisting of the following 33 components, from top to bottom: 34 * A 3-foot-thick operations layer 35 * A CDN drainage layer for primary leachate collection 36 * A 60-mil textured primary HDPE geomembrane 37 * A CDN drainage layer for primary leak detection/collection 38 * A 60-mil textured secondary HDPE geomembrane 39 * A 3-ft-thick low-hydraulic conductivity admix liner 40 The side slope lining system is a single geomembrane liner over a composite liner, meeting the 41 requirements of WAC 173-303-665(2)(h)(i). The 3H:IV side slopes for the IDF will result in little or no 42 leachate head build-up on the side slope lining system, thus eliminating the need for a lining system 43 design that exceeds the WAC requirements. Appendix 4A. 1.52

--- Page 138 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I In general, the liner system consists of two types of materials, geosynthetics and soil/bentonite mixtures 2 (admix). The geomembranes, geotextiles, and CDN are manufactured from polymeric materials, such as 3 HDPE, and polypropylene, made from synthetic polymers. The GCL consists of a bentonite layer 4 sandwiched between two polypropylene geotextiles to assist in placement and construction. The admix 5 liner is comprised mainly of silt to clay-sized particles, mixed with a silty sand base soil. 6 5.6.2 Leachate Characterization Assumptions 7 Several assumptions were made regarding the composition of the leachate concentrations and the 8 applicability of previously conducted studies for this evaluation. Specifically, the studies considered 9 directly applicable to this evaluation were: 10 * Geosynthetic and Soil Liner/Leachate Compatibility Studies for the W-025 Radioactive Mixed 11 Waste Landfill in Hanford 200 West (Golder Associates, 1991a and 1991b; TRI, 1995; and 12 WHC, 1995) 13 * Liner/Leachate Compatibility Study for the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National 14 Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) Comprehensive Environmental Response, 15 Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Disposal Facility (ICDF) (DOE-ID, 2002). 16 Using these studies is considered appropriate for the following reasons: 17 * The leachate for the IDF is expected to have similar or lower concentrations of radionuclides than 18 that used in the W025 facility study (since similar waste streams [other than ILAW] may be 19 accepted). 20 * The leachate chemistry may be of similar composition to the W025 facility study (since similar 21 waste streams [other than ILAW] may be accepted). 22 * Soils used in the W025 facility admix design are similar to those that will be used in the IDF 23 admix design and will therefore be compatible. 24 * Similar technical specifications for the geosynthetics and admix liner used in the W025 facility 25 design will be used in the IDF landfill design. 26 * A similar technical specification for a GCL used in the ICDF facility will be used in the IDF liner 27 design. 28 5.6.2.1 Synthetic Leachate Concentrations for W-025 Landfill 29 The leachate generated for the W025 evaluation reflects both the waste materials and the stabilization 30 agents used during waste preparation. Because the landfill will comply with waste acceptance criteria for 31 WAC dangerous waste and RCRA facilities (as does the IDF), organic materials are not expected to be 32 present in the waste after processing. The proposed geosynthetic materials are susceptible to damage 33 from certain organic compounds but generally are not susceptible to damage from inorganic compounds, 34 even with extreme pH values. As a result, the lack of organic materials results in a relatively benign 35 leachate. 36 The source leachate generated for the W025 studies, was primarily based on the waste treatment and 37 packaging approaches for W025. An aqueous solution of inorganic, with some organic compounds for 38 conservative evaluation, was generated, resulting in a viscous, slurry-like mixture. This mixture was 39 placed in a leaching column, and deionized water was introduced to simulate the effects of leachate 40 generation. Although no organic components were anticipated in the waste, small quantities of benzene, 41 methanol, and light machine oil were included to simulate the presence of organic compounds in the 42 waste material. 43 The source leachate generated through the leachate column process was chemically analyzed with the 44 following results: Appendix 4A.1.53

--- Page 139 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Concentrations of organics benzene and machine oil were below detection limits. Concentrations 2 of methanol were detected, but at concentrations not considered aggressive for polyester or 3 HDPE. 4 * Metals added to the waste were below the detection limits in the source leachate. 5 * Primary constituents of the source leachate were sodium cations and common inorganic anions, 6 with a pH of 9.2. 7 * Based on these results, a synthetic leachate was generated for testing purposes. The source 8 leachate formula resulted in a solution with total inorganics and dissolved salts of approximately 9 204,000 mg/L and pH of 9.2 using NaOH or HNO3, as required. 10 5.6.2.2 Simulated Irradiation Exposure for W-025 Landfill 11 Samples used to evaluate the effects of radiation were subjected to a 50,000-rad total dose of gamma 12 radiation. This dose is expected to exceed the maximum level of radiation experienced by geosynthetic 13 materials in the landfill under unfavorable conditions. Use of a total dose, rather than radiation type, is 14 considered the primary factor causing damage to polymeric materials and is considered to adequately 15 simulate actual IDF leachate conditions. Samples and leachate were irradiated together so that any 16 synergistic effects would be seen. The following samples were included in the irradiation testing: 17 * Geomembrane 18 * Geotextile 19 * Geonet 20 * Admix (soil/bentonite mixture) 21 The synthetic leachate and radiation exposure developed from the W-025 studies were used as the basis of 22 evaluation for the IDF lining system materials. Table 5-2 provides a comparison of the leachate 23 concentrations for the W-025 project with other studies for which the U.S. Environmental Protection 24 Agency (EPA) Test Method 9090 were performed on the lining system. 25 The ICDF project did not include EPA 9090 tests, however, a model for estimating leachate concentration 26 based on the waste acceptance criteria for the project was developed. The maximum leachate 27 concentrations and radiation exposure developed for the ICDF (DOE-ID, 2002) based on the anticipated 28 waste design inventory were as follows: 29 * Organics-70 mg/1 30 * Inorganics-18,400 mg/l 31 * Radiation Exposure-12,000 rads 32 Table 5-2.

EPA Test Method 9090 "Compatibility Test for Wastes and Membrane Liners" (EPA, 1992c). I A review of the studies presented in Table 5-2 leads to the conclusion that the inorganic concentration 2 developed for the W025 is somewhat conservative as it significantly higher than inorganic concentrations 3 developed for the ICDF facilities. Other than the W-025 landfill, the ICDF is estimated to be most 4 similar to the waste type to be received at the IDF of the studies included in Table 5-2. Nonetheless, the 5 liner/leachate compatibility study for the IDF is based on the W025 synthetic leachate. Further analysis 6 of the applicability of these leachate concentrations is recommended, if the conservative nature of this 7 synthetic leachate requires costly revisions to the lining system to demonstrate compatibility. 8 5.6.3 Chemical and Radiation Resistance 9 Leachate will be generated from precipitation events and from water added to the waste for dust control 10 and compaction purposes during operations. In reality, as the landfill nears the end of its operational life, 11 concentrations of contaminants will decrease with time as the leachable waste mass is reduced. During 12 the post-closure period, a robust landfill cover will significantly reduce infiltration, and the corresponding 13 volume of leachate. Soluble contaminants leached from the waste will come in contact with the landfill 14 bottom liner system during the operation period (approximately 10 years for each of the four planned 15 phases) and minimum post closure period (30 years). The geosynthetics and admix lining system 16 components may be in contact with soluble contaminants as long as contaminants are present in the 17 landfill. 18 The expected chemical make up of the leachate for the IDF landfill was determined based on previously 19 conducted compatibility studies (as discussed above) applicable to the same waste stream (the W025 20 studies), summarized as follows. 21 5.6.3.1 Geomembrane 22 HDPE geomembranes can deteriorate from contact with certain leachates, resulting in a decrease of 23 elongation at failure, an increase in modulus of elasticity, a decrease in the stress at failure, and a loss of 24 ductility. 25 Studies performed on polymer materials like HDPE show that their properties begin to change after 26 absorbing ionizing radiation between 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 rads (Koerner et al., 1990). The HDPE 27 geomembrane lining the bottom of the landfill will absorb ionizing radiation energy from the leachate 28 generated in the landfill. Energy will be absorbed during the operational life of the landfill, as long as 29 there are liquids with ionizing radionuclides in contact with the geomembranes. 30 Relevant compatibility studies on HDPE geomembranes have been performed for the W-025 Landfill 31 (Golder, 1991a; TRI, 1995; WHC, 1995). The results of these studies indicate that a HDPE 32 geomembrane will function well as a liner beneath the landfill waste. Appendix 4A.1.55

--- Page 141 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 EPA Method 9090 tests performed on HDPE geomembrane for the W-025 landfill, using the synthetic 2 leachate solution (assumed representative of IDF leachate concentrations) resulted in no evidence of 3 geomembrane deterioration. A comparison between the anticipated IDF landfill leachate 4 (W-025 Landfill) and that used in compatibility tests for other facilities is summarized in Table 5-2. 5 Geomembrane samples tested for the W-025 facility did not produce measurable changes in the HDPE 6 liner properties when irradiated for 120 days with a total dose of 50,000 rads. HDPE geomembranes are 7 manufactured with additives, such as carbon black and antioxidants, to improve ductility and durability. 8 The literature also indicates that these additives allow higher doses than standard HDPE material without 9 additives (Kircher and Bowman, 1964). The literature indicates that thin films (i.e., 0.002 inches) of 10 different types of HDPE material alone can become brittle when irradiated at doses between 4,400,000 11 and 78,000,000 rads. Studies performed using polymer materials, with carbon black and antioxidant 12 additives, show that properties typically begin to change at a total radiation dose of between 1,000,000 13 and 10,000,000 rads (Koerner et al., 1990). 14 The manufacturers of the geosynthetic products proposed for the IDF landfill have published maximum 15 allowable concentrations of various chemical compounds that can contact the HDPE geomembrane 16 without adversely affecting its performance. The most recent recommended maximum concentrations of 17 chemicals were obtained from the manufacturers of HDPE geomembrane (meeting the requirements for 18 the IDF technical specifications). A list of the manufacturers' maximum allowable concentrations for 19 specific leachate constituents for HDPE geomembrane and the GCL materials is shown on Table 5-3. 20 5.6.3.2 Geosynthetic Clay Liner (GCL) 21 The GCL underlying the geomembrane in the IDF landfill consists of processed sodium bentonite clay, 22 sandwiched between two geotextile fabrics. Sodium bentonite is an ore comprised mainly of the 23 montmorillonite clay mineral with broad, flat, negatively charged platelets that attract water, which 24 hydrates the bentonite. The swelling provides the ability to seal around penetrations, giving the GCL its 25 self-healing properties. A GCL product with Volclay-type sodium bentonite (manufactured by CETCO) 26 is specified for installation at the landfill. 27 The compatibility of GCL materials is usually demonstrated by permeating the material with leachate and 28 then determining its hydraulic conductivity. Typically, solutions with high concentrations of 29 contaminants or pure products are allowed to permeate a sample under confining pressure and the 30 saturated hydraulic conductivity of the material is determined using ASTM methods such as ASTM 31 D5084. A significant increase in saturated hydraulic conductivity (approximately one order of 32 magnitude) for a sample permeated with leachate, compared with a sample permeated with water, would 33 be an indicator of incompatibility. 34 Based on review of the published studies (Ruhl and Daniel, 1997; Shackelford, et al., 2000; and EPA, 35 1995), GCLs perform well unless exposed to high concentrations of divalent cations, very acidic or basic 36 solutions, or solutions with a low dielectric constant (such as gasoline). The leachate expected at the IDF 37 will have a pH of 9.2, which is a mid-range pH. The studies further demonstrate that, when confined 38 under a higher normal load (greater than 2000 psf) or if water is the first wetting liquid (Daniel et al., 39 1997), GCLs will perform well when exposed to high divalent cation concentrations. The GCL for the 40 IDF lining system is expected to confine under normal loads in excess of 2000 psf as soon as the first lift 41 or waste is placed. 42 No studies were identified that considered the long-term effects of radiation on the physical properties of 43 GCL materials. Since long-term studies cannot be conducted, conservative radiation limitations have 44 been employed. Low-hydraulic conductivity soils have been used at multiple DOE facilities containing 45 radioactive waste. The only known potential adverse reaction that can occur with a GCL is high heat that 46 could dry out the materials. The amount of radioactivity is expected to be low in the IDF landfill waste 47 and will not generate a significant amount of heat that can desiccate the admix liner. Also, it is assumed 48 that the ILAW packages will be cooled to ambient temperatures prior to placement with the cell. Appendix 4A.1.56

--- Page 142 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I It should be noted that the operations layer and drain gravel will provide a 3-foot buffer on the side slope 2 and a 4-foot buffer between the liner system and waste for additional thermal protection, if needed. 3 Sodium bentonite is the primary clay mineral in a GCL that produces the low hydraulic conductivity and 4 high swell potential. Exposure of sodium bentonite to liquids containing concentrated salts (such as 5 brines), or divalent cation concentrations (such as Ca++ and Mg++), reduces the swelling potential and 6 increases its hydraulic conductivity. Concentrated organic solutions (such as hydrocarbons) and strong 7 acids and bases can break down the soil, which also increases hydraulic conductivity. The physical 8 mechanism that causes these changes is a reduction of the thickness, and related absorption capacity, of 9 the diffuse double layer of water molecules surrounding the clay minerals. This results in an effective 10 decrease in the volume of the clay, since the water molecules are not attracted to the clay particles. 11 The GCL manufacturer allows the use of GCL with few restrictions on maximum chemical 12 concentrations. Leachate concentrations for the IDF landfill (based on synthetic leachate from W025) 13 have relatively high inorganics and dissolved salts. The W025 dissolved salt concentrations are above the 14 manufacturers recommended concentration of 35,000 mg/L (see Table 5-3) (CETCO, 2001). As a point 15 of reference, this concentration of dissolved salts is typical of seawater (USGS, 1989). However, the 16 dissolved salt concentrations in the IDF leachate have been characterized as primarily sodium, and the 17 synthetic leachate was comprised of entirely sodium salts, not the divalent cations such as Ca++ and 18 Mg++, as assumed by the manufacturers. As such, the impact on GCL hydraulic conductivity should be 19 less as compared to divalent cation solutions. Additionally, any effects of leachate degradation on the 20 GCL would be minimized by hydration of the GCLs' sodium bentonite with relatively "fresh" water, 21 allowing the GCL to swell initially and decrease hydraulic conductivity. 22 The rationale for use of the GCL in the IDF landfill primary liner is to "deflect" leachate from defects or 23 pinholes in the geomembrane over the bottom area and longer-term storage areas (such as the leachate 24 sump trough), where leachate head potential is greatest. The main purpose of the primary GCL is to 25 reduce the actual leakage rate into the LDS in the event of leak in the primary geomembrane (see 26 Section 5.10 and Appendix C.10). The GCL is expected to contact leachate only in the event of a leak in 27 the primary geomembrane. These leachate collection and storage areas are subject to flushing throughout 28 the active life of the landfill due to phased development and fill sequence, resulting in a more dilute 29 leachate in leakage areas prior to attaining maximum leachate concentrations. Based on these 30 considerations, the GCL and landfill liner system approach should perform as intended under the 31 anticipated conditions. 32 5.6.3.3 Admix Liner 33 The admix layer consists of onsite silty sand mixed with processed bentonite amendment, similar to that 34 used in the construction of GCLs. The swelling of sodium bentonite provides the ability to seal around 35 soil particles, giving the admix a low hydraulic conductivity and self-healing properties. The 36 compatibility of the admix layer with anticipated irradiation and leachate concentrations were evaluated 37 previously as part of the W025 landfill design (Golder Associates, 1991b). The following summarizes the 38 results of the compatibility testing for the admix layer that are directly applicable to the IDF landfill 39 admix liner, since similar materials will be used in construction. More detailed discussion of the IDF 40 admix liner design is provided in Section 5.4. 41 In the W025 study, samples of the admix were irradiated, similar to that conducted for the geomembrane 42 layer, as discussed previously. Differences between irradiated and non-irradiated samples were not 43 considered significant based on the results of testing. 44 The initial W025 admix design contained approximately 8 percent bentonite clay. Testing indicated an 45 acceptable hydraulic conductivity of this admix after hydration in fresh water. However, when hydrated 46 in leachate, some hydraulic conductivity test values were twice the allowable limit and, therefore, this 47 admix formulation was not considered acceptable. This is the same leachate chemistry assumed for the 48 IDF landfill. Appendix 4A.1.57

--- Page 143 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I It should be noted that there are two factors not considered in the W025 compatibility study (Golder 2 Associates, 199 1b) that would mitigate the impact of the synthetic leachate on the 8 percent admix 3 samples, as listed below: 4 Effective stress for samples-hydraulic conductivity tests were performed with effective stresses of 5-10 5 psi across sample (equivalent to less than one full lift of ILAW packages). It is well documented that 6 higher effective stresses will lower hydraulic conductivity and mitigate the effects of shrinking/cracking 7 in clay under attack from chemicals. In reality, by the time any leachate contacts the lining system, there 8 will be a substantial stress load on the liner that will mitigate the impacts of chemicals in leachate on the 9 admix liner. 10 First wetting liquid-W025 tests were performed using both site water and synthetic leachate as the 11 initial wetting fluid. It is well documented that if a clay soil is "attacked" by inorganics prior to 12 saturation, the increase in hydraulic conductivity will be more dramatic than if water is first permeant. 13 This was confirmed by W025 testing-there was an order of magnitude difference between samples with 14 water as first wetting liquid as opposed to leachate. It is reasonable to expect something closer to water 15 than concentrated leachate will be the first wetting liquid for the IDF admix liner. 16 Due to the results in the W025 testing showing greater than acceptable hydraulic conductivity in the 17 admix when exposed to the W025 synthetic leachate, the bentonite percentage was increased from 8 to 18 12 percent. An admix containing 12 percent bentonite clay was permeated with synthetic leachate and 19 tested with a resulting hydraulic conductivity that was 3 to 10 times lower than the maximum allowable 20 limit (10-7 cm/sec). This admix formulation was considered acceptable with respect to W025 leachate 21 compatibility and is applicable to the IDF. Thus, the technical specifications (see Section 02666) require 22 a nominal 12 percent (range from 11 to 14 percent is acceptable) bentonite by weight for the admix liner. 23 Consideration should be given to lowering the bentonite percentage upon further characterization of the 24 IDF leachate and applicability of the mitigating factors discussed above. 25 5.6.3.4 Other Materials 26 Other materials for which compatibility needs to be addressed are the CDN and geotextiles (cushion, 27 separation, and bonded to geonet of CDN). While these materials do not serve a barrier function, they 28 provide either for removal of leachate or protection of the lining system and must continue to function 29 when exposed to leachate. 30 During the W025 design, the effect of the synthetic leachate on the geonet core of the CDN and the 31 geotextiles was evaluated (Golder Associates, 1991 a). The study concluded that a geonet core comprised 32 of HDPE provided adequate chemical and radiation resistance. For geotextiles, the study concluded that 33 geotextiles made of polyester fabric were susceptible to degradation and recommended that geotextile 34 material be limited to a more chemically resistant material such as polypropylene. The technical 35 specifications for the IDF require that geotextiles be made from polypropylene (see Section 02371); thus, 36 the geotextiles used for the IDF should have adequate chemical and radiation resistance. 37 Table 5-3.

Strong acids, bases, or oxidizing compounds were not identified in the W-025 compatibility studies. 5 5.7 Drainage Layer 6 The drainage layer for the LCRS consists of three components: the separation geotextile, the CDN, and 7 the drainage gravel. Analyses for the drainage layer required evaluation of these components. 8 5.7.1 Geotextile Analyses (Separation) 9 Analyses were preformed to verify that a separation geotextile between the operations layer and leachate 10 collection drain gravel is required by evaluating natural graded filter criteria for these materials. Results 11 indicated that natural filter criteria could not be achieved, thus a separation geotextile is required between 12 the operations layer and drain gravel. Supporting natural filter calculations are included in 13 Appendix C.6.a. 14 Analyses were conducted to determine the proper apparent opening size (AOS) and permittivity of the 15 separation geotextile. Required AOS and permittivity were determined based on filter, fines retention, 16 and clogging potential criteria. Results of these analyses were used to develop the technical specifications 17 for the separation geotextile (see Section 02371). Supporting geotextile filter calculations are also 18 included in Appendix C.6.A. 19 5.7.2 CDN Selection 20 The CDN selection was based on analysis of two design issues, CDN geotextile puncture resistance and 21 CDN required transmissivity. 22 5.7.2.1 CDN Geotextile Puncture Resistance 23 The LCRS CDN layer at the IDF will be overlain by the operations layer on the 3H: IV side slope. The 24 operations layer is allowed to contain a particle size up to 2 inches in dimension. An analysis was 25 performed to determine if the geotextile bonded to geonet (to form the CDN) would be punctured by 26 particles/rocks of this size. 27 The method developed by Koerner (1998) was used to calculate the puncture resistance. Koerner's 28 method considers the size and shape of the rock, as well as other factors that could decrease the long-term 29 strength of the geotextile. The two loading conditions examined were initial placement of the operations 30 layer and the final depth of waste and closure cover. The geomembrane puncture resistance analysis (see 31 Section 5.5.4) provides the details for the load analysis for these conditions. Detailed calculations for 32 CDN geotextile puncture resistance and corresponding cushion geotextile requirements are included in 33 Appendix C.6.bl. 34 Results of the analyses indicate that the required puncture resistance is 11.2 lbs. The minimum specified 35 value for Type I geotextile (see technical specifications, Section 02371) is 65 lbs. Applying a partial 36 safety factor of 2 gives a minimum resistance of 32.5 lbs. Therefore, the proposed geotextile bonded to 37 the geonet of the CDN will resist puncture with a global safety factor of 2.9; it is adequate for resistance 38 to puncture from the overlying operations layer under the pressure of maximum landfill contents pressure. 39 Koerner (1998) recommends a minimum global safety factor of 2.0. 40 It should be noted that the results of this analysis are considered conservative because the analytical 41 method assumes only a uniform particle size and does not take the surrounding soil matrix into 42 consideration. This would effectively reduce the particle size by a considerable degree. 43 5.7.2.2 CDN Required Transmissivity 44 An additional selection criteria for the CDN is the required transmissivity (or flow rate) under design 45 loading conditions. For the IDF two cases require analysis: Appendix 4A.1.59

--- Page 145 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I LDS CDN on bottom and side slope-For this case, the critical condition is to ensure that the 2 transmissivity as required by WAC and EPA regulations (3 x 10-5 m2/sec) under the maximum load from 3 the landfill contents can be achieved. 4 LCRS CDN on side slope only-There are actually two loading conditions for the LCRS CDN on the side 5 slope. One is the open slope condition with operations layer only over the CDN, which is a low normal 6 load (1,000 psf) condition. The second is in the filled condition, which is a high normal load (15,000 psf) 7 condition. Based on the results of leachate production analyses using the Hydrologic Evaluation of 8 Landfill Performance (HELP) model (see Section 5.8), the required transmissivity for the LCRS CDN is 9 6.5 x 10-5 m2/sec for the open slope condition and 1 x 10-5 m2/sec for the filled condition. 10 For each case, the approach was to compare the required transmissivity to typical manufacturer's data 11 with test conditions (i.e., normal load and material boundary), similar to the design conditions. The 12 allowable transmissivity (<p) was determined using guidance provided by GRI standard GC-8 (2001), 13 Determination of the Allowable Flow Rate of a Drainage Geocomposite. The GRI-GC8 standard uses the 14 following equation: 15 (Pallow 9100 hr test/Reduction Factors for intrusion, creep, chemical clogging and biological clogging 16 The FS for design was then determined as follows: 17 FS (Pallow/(Prequired 18 Transmissivity data for the 100-hour test data was obtained from the manufacturer for both 200-mil and 19 250-mil thickness CDN for normal loads of both 1,000 psf and 15,000 psf. Test data was provided for a 20 number of boundary conditions including flow tests between a geomembrane and a soil, as would be the 21 case for the LCRS or LDS CDN. Test data used as the basis for the analyses are included with the 22 calculations presented in Appendix C.6.b2. 23 Based on the analyses, a higher flow, thicker (250-mil minimum) CDN is required, due to the reduction of 24 flow under the high normal loads in the final filling configuration. The technical specifications (see 25 Section 02373) provide the required index values for the geonet core of the CDN as well as the CDN 26 itself (with geotextile bonded to both sides of the geonet), based on the results of this analysis. The 27 transmissivity requirements in the technical specifications are index values and not in-service condition 28 values, as determined in this analysis. These index values are representative of testing that manufacturers 29 typically perform in production and are correlated to design conditions using the approach outlined in 30 GRI GC-8. 31 5.7.3 Drainage Gravel Selection 32 Section 02315 (Fill and Backfill) in the technical specifications requires that drain gravel meets the 33 requirements of WSDOT 9-03.12(4) for gradation. The technical specifications also require a 34 performance specification for a hydraulic conductivity greater or equal to 10-1 cm/sec. 35 Hydraulic conductivity of the specified drain gravel was estimated using two different empirical 36 relationships. The most relevant of the two estimates a minimum hydraulic conductivity of I cm/sec, 37 based on the specified gradation curve for WSDOT Gravel Backfill for Drains (9-03.12[4]). Supporting 38 calculations are included in Appendix C.6.c. 39 The minimum estimated hydraulic conductivity for the drain gravel exceeds the required (by WAC and 40 EPA regulations) hydraulic conductivity of 10-2 cm/sec by a factor or 100 to 1,000, and the performance 41 specification hydraulic conductivity of 10-1 cm/sec by a factor of 10 to 100. This exceedance makes an 42 allowance for two items: (1) it allows for the uncertainty in the empirical formulas used to predict 43 hydraulic conductivity, and (2) it also allows for the potential long-term reduction in hydraulic 44 conductivity in the drain gravel as fines from waste filling and the operations layer migrate into the gravel 45 over time. Appendix 4A.1.60

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 As part of Construction QA, testing it is recommended that samples of imported drain gravel be tested for 2 conformance with the gradation and hydraulic conductivity requirements in the technical specifications. 3 5.8 Leachate Production 4 5.8.1 Leachate Production Analyses 5 Estimates of the amount of leachate produced during the development and operation of the IDF were 6 needed to design the components of the leachate collection and conveyance system described in Section 7 5.9, and to provide information necessary when evaluating slope stability of the side slope and bottom 8 liner systems. Leachate is produced when precipitation falls within the lined area and infiltrates vertically 9 through the waste and/or bottom liner system. The amount of infiltration estimated to occur depends on 10 the hydrologic processes and the relative fraction of precipitation that results as leachate and is collected 11 by the leachate collection system. 12 The water balance components of the hydrologic process were estimated using EPA's Hydrologic 13 Evaluation of Landfill Performance (HELP) Model (Schroeder et. al., 1997), a well known standard for 14 water balance modeling. The HELP model has been widely used for evaluating hydrologic conditions 15 and is the standard model used for providing information necessary for the design of landfill systems. 16 Estimates of the water balance components of the hydrologic cycle provided by HELP include 17 precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface water runoff, vertical percolation, soil moisture storage, and 18 lateral drainage in soil layers. 19 The HELP model requires input of weather data, representing the conditions at the landfill location, soils 20 data representing the various layers of cover soils, waste materials, and soils underlying the waste layers, 21 and other design data used by the model for water balance calculations. A detailed description of the 22 model and modeling inputs are included in Appendix C.7. 23 The development of the IDF from Phase I through Phase IV was considered to determine the maximum 24 flow condition expected during development and operation of the landfill. That is, various combinations 25 of open and interim closed phases were considered and the combination calculated to produce the 26 maximum amount of leachate was chosen for analysis. The chosen combination was Phase I through III 27 under interim closure condition and Phase IV in the open condition with little or no waste present. The 28 flows from this condition were used to size the LCRS collection piping and pump systems. 29 Water balance components were taken directly from model output and a spreadsheet was used to calculate 30 the volumes of leachate by multiplying the HELP output parameter by the area of the type of system 31 modeled. For example, the lateral drainage estimated by the HELP model for the uncovered side slope 32 condition in Phase IV development was multiplied by the total side slope area to determine the total 33 volume of leachate from that area. A spreadsheet summarizing the estimated leachate flows is included in 34 Appendix C.7. 35 The following modeling results were used for various aspects of design of the IDF systems: 36 LCRS collection system-Modeling results for the peak day event were used to size the leachate 37 collection system piping that conveys flow to the LCRS systems. The peak day event, as predicted by 38 HELP and referenced herein, was a 1.6-inch precipitation event. This event is approximately 25 percent 39 higher than the 25 year, 24 hour peak day storm event of 1.28 inches (Appendix C.9), required by 40 regulations to be used when complying with the maximum 12 inches of head over the liner 41 (WAC 173-303-665, see Section 2). The spacing of the LCRS perforated collection piping and the 42 properties of the drain gravel material that convey lateral drainage flows above the bottom liner 43 geomembrane to the collection piping and LCRS sump area were checked to insure the maximum head 44 buildup above the sump area of the liner system did not exceed the maximum allowed according to 45 regulatory requirements, as outlined in Section 2. 46 LCRS pump and forcemain systems-Modeling results for the peak day event were used to size the 47 LCRS high flow pump system that conveys flow to the leachate storage tanks and truck loadout facilities. Appendix 4A.1.61

--- Page 147 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Average monthly flow rates plus one standard deviation (resulting in a conservatively-high expected flow 2 rate) was used to design the LCRS low flow pump system for pumping from the IDF during average 3 monthly conditions. 4 Leachate Collection Storage-Volumes for the peak day event and assumptions for the operational rate 5 of removal of leachate from the tanks were used to size the storage tanks. Storage tank sizing is described 6 in Section 5.9.2.2. 7 Liner system material properties and stability analyses-The lateral drainage layers of the side slope 8 and bottom liner systems were checked to insure the transmissivity of the layers was sufficient to convey 9 lateral flows and maintain less than the maximum head buildup over the liner system. The seepage height 10 above the liner was used when checking the liner system for veneer stability. 11 5.9 Leachate Collection System 12 5.9.1 Earth Loading Analyses 13 5.9.1.1 Leachate System Loading Analyses for Piping within Phase I Liner Limits 14 Loading over the leachate system piping include all layers of soil materials, wastes, and anticipated traffic 15 loading. The maximum loading occurs over the piping in the LCRS and LDS sump area, because of its 16 low elevation and the height of material-both waste and soil layers-overlying the sumps. Loading 17 calculations from the geosynthetic liner puncture resistance calculations described in Section 5.5.4 were 18 modified to represent the maximum loading in the LCRS/LDS sump area. Other pipes in the Phase I 19 area, including piping outside the sump and the side slope riser piping, will be subjected to less than the 20 maximum loading. The maximum loading is listed in Appendix C.8.a, along with the calculations for 21 pipe sizing required to withstand this anticipated pipe loading. 22 Pipe wall thickness was selected based on the maximum loading anticipated in the sump area such that 23 the pipe will not fail due to excessive deflection, wall buckling, or wall crushing. All other piping in 24 Phase I outside of the sump area was chosen with the same standard dimension ratio (SDR) to withstand 25 the maximum load. Standard analysis methods, as recommended by the manufacturer of HDPE pipe 26 made from PE3408 type resin, were used to evaluate pipe strength under loading. These standard 27 methods are based on flexible pipe design practice as applied to HDPE piping. The manufacturer's 28 recommended design analysis techniques are based on standard analysis techniques, including the Iowa 29 formula (Waste Containment Systems, Waste Stabilization, and Landfills Design and Evaluation, Sharma 30 and Lewis, 1994), with conservative factors of safety. The potential loss of strength due to the 31 perforations in the perforated collection piping was assumed non-significant, based on actual test results 32 of perforated pipe under similar load rates. The pipe material assumed is High Density Polyethylene 33 PE3408 pipe with a cell classification of 345434C or better. The flexural modulus and material strength 34 of the pipe was per manufacturer's published literature, based on this classification of pipe. 35 5.9.1.2 Leachate System Loading Analyses for Piping Outside of Phase I Liner Limits 36 Piping outside the Phase I liner area includes all underground piping between the crest pad building, 37 combined sump, leachate transfer building, storage tank, and tanker truck load out facility (see Drawing 38 H-2-830846). The civil road layout in these areas is generally configured to allow medium to light duty 39 trucks, such as would be used for operations and maintenance activities. The leachate tanker truck 40 accesses the concrete truck load pad only, and would not normally pass over any piping. However, the 41 piping outside the Phase I Liner area was designed for H-20 semi-trailer type loading to be conservative. 42 The same SDR pipe that used for the high loading within the Phase I liner limits as described in Section 43 5.9.1.1 was assumed for all piping exposed to earth and traffic loading outside of the Phase I liner limits. 44 The expected pipe loading for H-20 loading plus earth load was compared to the loading used for 45 designing the piping inside the Phase I liner limits and was found to be much lower. Since the pipe SDR 46 is sufficiently strong for the maximum loading inside the Phase I limits, it will have more than sufficient 47 strength for loading expected outside the Phase I limits. Calculations are included in Appendix C.8.a. Appendix 4A. 1.62

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 5.9.2 Leachate System Hydraulics Analyses 2 5.9.2.1 Leachate System Hydraulics Analyses 3 The leachate collection and conveyance system collects leachate that accumulates as a result of 4 precipitation landing within the footprint of the cells, and it conveys the collected leachate from the cells to a storage tank or tanker truck. Perforated collection piping in the LCRS collects and conveys leachate 6 from the bottom liner system and conveys it to a LCRS sump area in both cells. Lateral flow of leachate 7 from the side slope and bottom liner areas also is conveyed directly to the sump area through a high 8 permeability gravel layer and/or geosynthetic drainage net material. Submersible pumps in the LCRS 9 sump and contained within perforated riser pipes convey leachate to the crest pad building and directly to 10 the leachate storage tank or the tanker truck load facility. Hydraulics analysis was conducted to size the 11 gravity flow piping of the LCRS collection piping and the pump and force main system from the sump 12 area to the storage tank and tanker truck load facility. Sizing and design of leachate collection and 13 conveyance systems were based on ultimate build out of the IDF through Phase IV. That is, the 14 components installed as part of the Phase I design are sized for the ultimate configuration and flows 15 estimated through Phase IV. 16 5.9.2.2 LCRS Gravity Flow Analyses 17 The LCRS perforated collection piping was sized using standard gravity flow analysis techniques. The 18 pipe size (nominal 12-inch diameter) was chosen as double the minimum size required for cleanout of the 19 pipe to insure any accumulation of fines would not significantly restrict the flow in the pipe, even though 20 the drain gravel surrounding the pipe will have minimal fines present and geotextiles are present in the 21 lining system to further restrict the migration of any fines. The maximum flow used for sizing was the 22 maximum from the HELP predicted maximum day flow rate or the pump flow rate, based on the pump 23 chosen to convey flow out of the cell. 24 Perforations in the pipe were sized to allow flow rates much higher than the required maximum flow rate 25 out of the cell, with minimal head loss. This assumption was more conservative by virtue of the fact that 26 the main LCRS collection pipe will only collect and convey a portion of the lateral drainage flow from the 27 cell; the drain gravel and CDN will also convey a portion of the flow. Calculations are included in 28 Appendix C.8.b. 29 5.9.2.3 Leachate System Pumps and Force Mains Analyses 30 The pump and forcemain systems for conveying leachate out of the cells and into the leachate storage 31 tanks and to the tanker truck load out facility,. and the design considerations for each are described below. 32 Calculations are included in Appendix C.8.b. 33 LCRS pumps and forcemains-The LCRS pumps and forcemains convey leachate out of the cells to 34 storage tanks or the tanker truck load areas. The criteria for pumping capacity is that the maximum head 35 over the sump area of the cell will not be allowed to exceed 12 inches during the peak day event and 36 during normal operations. To meet the requirement for not exceeding the 12-inch criteria for the peak day 37 event, a LCRS high flow pump was sized to handle the expected peak day flow rate, as estimated and 38 described in Section 5.8, Leachate Production. Hydraulic analyses were conducted to size the pump and 39 forcemain piping according to standard practice to convey the maximum flow rate. 40 A LCRS low flow pump was sized to convey flow out of the cells under normal, monthly operations. The 41 criteria established for the low flow pump was to convey the average monthly flow plus one standard 42 deviation from the cells, assuming the pump could remove that amount of flow with less than continuous 43 operation. The highest value of the average month plus one standard deviation was used for the 44 maximum flow required of the pump. Under lower flow required conditions, the pump would operate 45 near this rate, depending on the system curve head loss characteristics, but would run for a shorter length 46 of time to remove the volume of leachate from the cell. 47 Appendix 4A. 1.63

--- Page 149 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 LDS pump and forcemain-The LDS pump and forcemain conveys flows from leakage through the 2 LCRS sump area, if in the unlikely event any leakage occurs, to the storage tank or tanker truck load out 3 facility. The LDS system is sized to convey the flow equal to the ALR (described in Section 5.11); 4 however, this rate is so small that the pump capacity is much higher than necessary. 5 Leachate transfer pump to truckload and forcemain-Under normal operations, leachate conveyed out 6 of the IDF will be routed to the leachate storage tank. Periodically the leachate will need to be conveyed 7 to tanker trucks for transport to an offsite water treatment facility. A transfer pump is required to move 8 water from the storage tank to the tanker truck loadout facility. The pump and forcemain were sized to 9 convey approximately 250 gallons per minute (gpm), a rate commensurate with timely loading of the 10 tanker trucks that have capacities equal to approximately 7,000 gallons. At 250 gpm, the tankers can be 11 loaded quickly, depending on the operational requirements for moving leachate and making storage tank 12 capacity available under high precipitation conditions and/or the condition when the storage tanks are at 13 or near capacity. Storage and operations considerations are described in Section 5.9.2.4. 14 Combined sump pump and forcemain-The combined sump pump and forcemain must convey flow 15 from the sump to the leachate storage tank. The flow criteria for this pump was set at approximately the 16 same flow as the leachate transfer pump. This is based on the worst case scenario of the leachate transfer 17 pump accidentally being left on when the tanker truck is filled, causing the full 250 gpm flow to overflow 18 the truck, collect on the pad, and drain into the combined sump. Under less than maximum flow 19 conditions, the pump would cycle when any leakage from other systems connected to the sump pump 20 reached the level on control setting for the pump. In this case, the pump would cycle quickly to pump the 21 small volume of the inner sump into the storage tank. 22 Crest pad building sump pump-A small sump pump is provided in the crest pad building to remove 23 minor amounts of water in the sump from sampling activities or piping leaks. The nominal flow rate was 24 chosen as a minimum of four gpm. The pump discharges into the main forcemain line to the storage tank 25 or tanker truck load out facility. 26 The pump and forcemain piping systems were modeled using standard hydraulic analysis techniques. 27 Actual pump curves for preliminary pump selections were input and the analyses conducted to determine 28 the estimated run condition for the various operational conditions. For example, a pump was chosen for 29 the LCRS high flow pump and forcemain system, and the analysis was run for the conditions of the pump 30 conveying flow to the leachate storage tank and directly to the tanker truck load out facility. Different 31 flow rates and system pressures resulted, based on the differences in the system curve for each flow path 32 versus the pump curve characteristics. Pump cycle times were considered for the flow requirements and 33 total removed volume. The manufacturer's recommendations for cycle times and other operating 34 requirements, where applicable, were checked. 35 5.9.2.4 Leachate Collection Storage Analyses 36 The results of the leachate production analysis indicate a total of approximately 269,000 gallons of 37 leachate must be removed from the IDF landfill within 24 hours after a peak storm event. A temporary 38 storage tank for each cell was sized to store leachate generated by the associated cell. The leachate 39 storage tank capacity is dependent on the flow rate of leachate into and out of the tank as well as a factor 40 of safety. 41 The leachate production analysis indicates the worst case flow rate out of each cell into the associated 42 tank would be 157 gpm (sum of the required flow rates of the high and low flow leachate pumps). The 43 leachate transfer pump for each cell can fill a tanker truck at a maximum of 250 gpm; however, the 44 limiting factor is how often a truck can be filled. 45 The calculation in Appendix C.8.c presents the method of determining the appropriate storage capacity of 46 each leachate storage tank. The following leachate tanker truck loading activities were assumed: 47 * Tanker Capacity 7,000 gallons 48 * Number of tankers per cycle 1 Appendix 4A. 1.64

--- Page 150 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Hours per cycle (roundtrip) 2.4 2 * Hours per shift 8 3 * Shifts per day 1 4 * Leachate tank level prior to event 2 feet 5 The calculation indicates that each tank requires a maximum operational capacity of 375,000 gallons to 6 maintain a safety factor of 1.5. The assumptions made in the calculation must be adhered to during 7 operational activities to maintain the calculated safety factor. 8 5.10 Surface Stormwater 9 The surface stormwater analysis was done to determine the sizes of the surface stormwater facilities 10 necessary for the IDF Phase I Critical Systems Design. The surface stormwater analysis is documented in 11 detail in Appendix C.9. 12 The governing regulation is WAC 173-303-665(2) (c) and (d). This requires that the stormwater system 13 be designed to prevent flow onto the active portion of the landfill during peak discharge from at least a 14 25-year storm. It also requires that the runoff management system be designed to collect and control at 15 least the water volume resulting from a 24-hour, 25-year storm. 16 The primary purpose of the proposed stormwater facilities is to prevent stormwater runoff from areas 17 adjacent to the two Phase I cells from entering the cells during Phase I operation. This will be done by 18 collecting, conveying, and safely discharging stormwater from areas outside of the two Phase I cells that 19 would otherwise run into these cells. 20 The Department of Ecology has issued State Waste Discharge Permit Number ST 4510 for industrial 21 stormwater discharges to the ground through engineered land disposal structures on the Hanford site (ST 22 4510, Ecology, 1999; DOE/RL97-67 Revision 3, January 2000). Since the design for this project does 23 include facilities for collecting stormwater runoff and discharging it to the ground, the permit was 24 reviewed to determine whether it applied to these stormwater discharges. To be covered by this permit, 25 the stormwater must be considered an industrial discharge that is collected in an engineered structure and 26 is then discharged to the ground through an engineered structure. A stormwater discharge is an industrial 27 discharge if the stormwater has the potential to come into contact with an industrial activity or is collected 28 within an area of industrial activity. The purpose of the stormwater facilities that have been designed for 29 this project is to prevent the stormwater from areas outside of the Phase I landfill from entering the 30 landfill area. Therefore, the stormwater collected by these facilities would probably not be considered 31 industrial stormwater. To be an engineered structure for the collection of stormwater, the structure has to 32 be an impervious surface that is directly associated with industrial activities. The stormwater collection 33 facilities designed for this project do not have impervious surfaces. Therefore, permit ST 4510 does not 34 apply to the stormwater system designed for this project. 35 Stormwater facilities were designed only for the operation stage of Phase I and not for interim or final 36 closure conditions. Therefore, no stormwater facilities have been designed for stormwater runoff from 37 the Phase I cells after construction of their interim closure or final closure. Stormwater needs for the 38 construction, operation, and closure of future phases were not considered. 39 No stormwater collection and conveyance facilities were analyzed and/or designed for any of the roads 40 and support facilities that will be constructed as part of this project. The roads will be gravel surfaced, 41 and stormwater that does run off the roads into adjacent areas will infiltrate. The stormwater from the 42 roofs of the buildings will be caught in gutters and discharged to the ground surface via down spouts. 43 The stormwater that falls on the leachate tanks will evaporate off the floating covers. 44 5.10.1 Existing Conditions 45 Under existing conditions, the area around the Phase I site slopes down gently from south to north at an 46 average grade of approximately 0.5 percent. Appendix 4A.1.65

--- Page 151 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I The only area that may generate stormwater that can run into the Phase I excavation is the area that 2 extends south from the excavation area to the crest of the sand dunes, located north of 1st Street (see 3 drainage areas figure in Appendix C.9). This drainage area is moderately vegetated, primarily with large 4 sage brush and grasses. The soils are generally sandy, with relatively high rates of infiltration. This area 5 typically receives little precipitation. There is little to no runoff, and stormwater normally either 6 infiltrates or is used by the vegetation. No existing drainage channels are apparent. The groundwater 7 table is approximately 300 feet below the ground surface. 8 5.10.2 Proposed Stormwater Facilities 9 To prevent stormwater from the area south of the Phase I excavation from running overland into the 10 excavation, a combination stormwater berm/ditch will be constructed south of the top of the south slope 11 of the excavation. The south end of the excavation will be approximately 1,400 feet long, and the ground 12 will be essentially flat. The berm/ditch will have a center high point and then slope down to the east and 13 to the west (two discharge points). A berm will be constructed immediately south of the ditch. At the 14 centerline of the excavation, the invert of the ditch will be at the existing ground surface, and the berm 15 will form the south slope of the ditch. The ditch will be excavated, with a longitudinal slope of 16 0.5 percent to both the east and the west. This will be done in order to minimize the depth of the ditch at 17 its east and west ends. Culverts will be installed at the east and west ditch ends to convey the flow under 18 the access roads. The culverts will discharge into the east and west infiltration areas. 19 The base map does not show any areas where stormwater runoff from offsite areas may flow into the east 20 or west boundaries of the Phase I excavation. However, if any offsite stormwater should flow toward 21 these boundaries, the fill for the berm access road and the shine berm will prevent the stormwater from 22 flowing into the excavation (see drainage areas figure in Appendix C.9). The intercepted stormwater will 23 flow south along the toe of the fill and either infiltrate or flow overland to the north, away from the site at 24 the north end of the berm access road. 25 The ground slopes away from the north end of the Phase I site, so there will be no offsite stormwater 26 running toward the north Phase I boundary. 27 The Phase I liner will end north of the toe of the south slope of the Phase I excavation. In order to reduce 28 potential leachate flows, a stormwater berm/ditch will be constructed just south of the south end of the 29 liner. This berm/ditch will intercept and convey stormwater runoff from the unlined south slope and the 30 unlined southern ends of the east and west slopes. The berm/ditch will be sloped to drain to the east. A 31 stormwater pipe will convey the stormwater under the landing for the access ramp and will discharge to 32 the excavation infiltration area. If this pipe ran straight from the ditch to the infiltration area, it would not 33 have adequate cover. Therefore, a catch basin with a solid cover will be installed near the west end of the 34 stormwater pipe. The invert of the pipe out of the catch basin will be lower than that of the pipe running 35 into this catch basin. The stormwater pipe that will run from the catch basin to the excavation infiltration 36 area will then have adequate cover. The excavation infiltration area will be excavated in the southeast 37 corner of the excavation. 38 The south edge of the access ramp into the Phase I excavation and the south edge of the "flat" area at the 39 bottom of the access ramp will serve as ditches. The access ramp will have a cross-slope of 2 percent 40 down to the south. The "flat" area at the bottom of the access ramp will have a slope down to the south 41 that varies between I and 3 percent. Adjacent to each of these will be the south slope of the excavation. 42 Construction of a full V-shaped ditch along the south side of the access ramp and the "flat" area was 43 considered. This idea was rejected because it would result in a larger excavation with the top of the Phase 44 I south slope moved further south. 45 The stormwater facilities are shown on the Phase I Grading and Drainage Plan drawing 46 (Drawing H-2-830830). 47 Stormwater runoff from the north, east, and west lined slopes of Phase I will run into the bottom lined 48 area and will become leachate. Appendix 4A.1.66

--- Page 152 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I There are no provisions in the design of the Phase I critical systems to divert clean runoff from these side 2 slopes and discharge it to the surface water system instead of the leachate system at this time. However, a 3 rain curtain or other approach to reduce the amount of clean runoff from the lined area that enters the 4 leachate system may be considered in the future. 5 5.10.3 Analysis 6 The surface stormwater analysis is documented in Appendix C.9 and is summarized below. 7 Stormwater runoff flows were estimated for a 24-hour, 25-year design event, using the Soil Conservation 8 Service curve number methodology as documented in Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds (U.S. 9 Department of Agriculture, June 1986) and the Hydraulic Engineering Cirular-1 (HEC-1) computer 10 program (Flood Hydrograph Package (HEC-1), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Hydrologic Engineering 11 Center, revised June 1988). The precipitation data used was based on information from the Hanford Site 12 Climatological Data Summary 2001 (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, May 2002). The ground at 13 the project site is periodically frozen during the winter months, when the most precipitation falls. 14 Therefore, it was assumed that the ground was frozen for the runoff flow calculations. 15 The peak flows (calculated using the HEC-1 model) were checked for reasonableness. The tabular and 16 graphical methods in TR 55 were used to estimate peak 25-year flows for each of the drainage areas 17 modeled in HEC-1. The results confirmed the reasonableness of the peak flows calculated by HEC-1. 18 The berm/ditches were designed to convey the peak 25-year flow with a minimum freeboard of one foot. 19 The infiltration areas were sized based on containing and infiltrating the runoff from the 24-hour, 25-year 20 design event, without causing the water surface to extend above the upstream end of the culvert or 21 stormwater pipe that will discharge to the infiltration area. No specific infiltration data have been 22 collected at the IDF project site. However, infiltration rates have been determined for use at the Waste 23 Treatment Plant (Geotechnical Report Supplement No. 1, Shannon and Wilson, April 2001). These 24 infiltration rates were used in sizing each of the infiltration areas. 25 The culverts and stormwater pipes were designed to convey the peak 25-year flow with a maximum 26 headwater to a diameter ratio of 1.25. Both inlet and outlet flow conditions were analyzed. The starting 27 water surface for the outlet flow condition calculations were the maximum water surface elevation 28 estimated for the associated infiltration area for the 24-hour, 25-year design event. 29 5.11 Action Leakage Rate (ALR) 30 5.11.1 LDS ALR 31 The ALR is defined in WAC 173-303-665(8) and the Final Rule (EPA 1992a, 40 CFR Part 264.222) as 32 the "maximum design flow rate that the leak detection system.. .can remove without the fluid head on the 33 bottom liner exceeding 1 foot". This calculation was performed to determine the ALR for the IDF lining 34 system. The IDF consists of two cells, each with an area of approximately 8.5 acres. 35 In addition to determining the ALR, an estimate of actual leakage rate through the proposed primary 36 bottom lining system is provided as a comparison to the calculated ALR. HELP modeling for the side 37 slope indicates negligible head build-up on the side slopes (see Section 5.8), thus an estimation of the 38 actual leakage rate was determined for the bottom primary lining system only. 39 EPA provides a formula (based on Darcy's Law for calculating this flow capacity), assuming that it 40 originates from a single hole in the primary liner (EPA, 1992b). Calculations presented in Appendix C.10 41 provide details of the method of analysis and input data. The ALR calculations are dependent on the 42 transmissivity value for the CDN. A value of 3 x 10-5 m2/sec was used in the ALR analysis (equivalent 43 to the value required by WAC and EPA regulations for the LDS, Section 5.7.2). Calculations in 44 Appendix C.6.b2 provide justification for the transmissivity used in the ALR analyses. 45 The results of the analyses indicate the ALR for each IDF cell is 206 gallons per acre per day (gpad) or 46 approximately 1,800 gallons per day per cell. This ALR includes a factor of safety of 2 in accordance 47 with EPA guidelines (EPA, 1992b). Appendix 4A.1.67

--- Page 153 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I It is also much lower than the capacity of the pump that removes liquid from the LDS. The estimated 2 actual leakage rate for the composite primary lining system is 0.06 gpad (small defect) to 0.08 gpad 3 (larger defect) for a composite liner with good intimate contact, and 0.3 gpad (small) to 0.4 gpad (large) 4 for poor contact. Detailed calculations for both rates are presented in Appendix C. 10. 5 The proposed primary composite lining system has a much lower estimated leakage rate than the ALR. 6 This demonstrates the benefit of the GCL that is included in the primary bottom lining system, to provide 7 a composite lining system and minimize actual leakage rate through the bottom primary lining system. 8 5.12 Building Systems Analyses 9 5.12.1 Geotechnical Design Parameters 10 The key geotechnical parameters and analyses for structural design of the supporting facilities for the 11 Hanford IDF included the following: 12 * Bearing Capacity 13 * Settlement 14 * Modulus of Subgrade Reaction 15 * Earth Pressures 16 * UBC Seismic Soil Parameters 17 The methodologies, input data, and results for each of these categories of analysis are presented in detail 18 in Appendix C.I l.A. 19 5.12.2 Structural 20 5.12.2.1 Crest Pad Building Foundation Analysis, Pipe Bracing and Winch 21 The crest pad building foundation was analyzed as a concrete slab on an elastic foundation. The 22 foundation was modeled with springs to model the vertical sub-grade reaction. The value of the vertical 23 sub-grade reaction was provided by the geotechnical engineer. The applied loads and load combinations 24 were input into Visual Analysis (version 4.0), a finite element program. The finite element analyses 25 results include elastic settlement, moments, and shears values of the concrete slab. The results were then 26 used to design slab depth and reinforcing. 27 Load reactions from the pre-engineered metal building were estimated using hand calculations and 28 applied onto the concrete slab at the corners of the slab. It is a reasonable assumption that the frame loads 29 from the pre-engineered metal building will only occur at the corner of the building, since the size of the 30 building will not require any intermediate framing. 31 Loads and load combinations were used as required by TFC-ENG-STD-06, REV A. Performance 32 category, PC-I was used as specified and applied as applicable for both wind, seismic, and load 33 combinations requirements. 34 In summary, the analyses results showed that an 8-inch thick slab sufficed with #5 reinforcing at 12-inch 35 centers. The analyses results also showed that a 1 foot-10 inch edge thickening around the perimeter of 36 the building would be sufficient. More detailed accounting of the analyses is presented in 37 Appendix C.11.bl. 38 The pipe bracing and support for the small diameter PVC (polyvinyl chloride) piping included both 39 gravity as well as lateral load resistance, due to a seismic event. The governing piping support is assumed 40 a 6-foot-tall cantilever support, with the piping load and 50 pounds of lateral load applied to the top of the 41 support. The 50 pound lateral load was used in lieu of the calculated seismic load because the calculated 42 seismic load was only 19 pounds. Using a 50 pound lateral load gives the pipe support system greater 43 rigidity. Detailed calculations of the pipe supports are included in Appendix C.11.b2. 44 The winch support was analyzed as a vertical cantilever that supports the winch and resists a total lateral 45 load of 400 pounds. Appendix 4A. 1.68

--- Page 154 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 A 400 pound lateral load was used since the entire gravity load of the pump and the hoses adds up to this 2 weight. Therefore, using 400 pounds in the horizontal direction is conservative. Detailed calculations of 3 the winch support are given in Appendix C. 1.b3. 4 5.12.2.2 Leachate Transfer Building Foundation Analysis 5 As the leachate transfer building foundation is considered as a slab-on-grade, only hand calculations were 6 performed. Foundation soil reactions were considered to be distributed linearly, then soil pressure 7 distributions were applied to the concrete to calculated the moment and shear values for design of the 8 concrete slab and reinforcing steel. 9 Load reactions from the pre-engineered metal building were estimated using hand calculations and 10 applied onto the concrete slab along the perimeter of the slab. 11 Loads and load combinations were used as required by TFC-ENG-STD-06, REV A. Performance 12 category, PC-1 was used as specified and applied as applicable for both wind, seismic, and load 13 combinations requirements. 14 In summary, the analyses results showed that the 2-foot-6 inch-thick slab with #6 bars at 12-inch centers 15 will suffice and appears to be overdesigned. The 2-foot-6-inch thickness is not based on concrete strength 16 requirements but more for frost depth cover, simplifying the ground forming, and reinforcing bending 17 requirements. Detailed calculations of the analyses are presented in Appendix C.1 l.c. 18 5.12.2.3 Leachate Tank Foundation Analysis 19 The leachate tank foundation is considered to be a concrete ringwall, per AWWA D103-97. The tank 20 gravity loads, including both water load and tank dead loads, were considered in the design of the 21 ringwall. 22 AWWA D103-97, Factory-Coated Bolted Steel Tanks for Water Storage is not listed in the TFC-ENG- 23 STD-06, REV A. AWWA D100-96, Welded Steel Tanks for Water Storage, is listed; however, this 24 standard does not apply, since the tank will be a bolted steel tank. Therefore, the tank will be designed 25 per AWWA D103-97, Factory-Coated Bolted Steel Tanks for Water Storage. 26 The analysis of the concrete ringwall and reinforcing is based on the hoop tension on the ringwall from 27 the surcharge of the liquid weight on the soil within the ringwall. In summary, a 4-foot-6-inch-deep by 28 1-foot-6-inch width ringwall with #7 at 12-inch-longitudinal reinforcing on each face of the ringwall will 29 suffice. Detailed calculations of the analyses are presented in Appendix C.1 1.d. 30 5.12.2.4 Truck Loading Station Foundation Analysis and Leachate Loading 31 The Truck Loading Station foundation was analyzed as a concrete slab on an elastic foundation. The 32 foundation was modeled with springs to model the vertical subgrade reaction. The value of the vertical 33 subgrade reaction was provided by the geotechnical engineer. The applied loads and load combinations 34 were input into Visual Analysis (version 4.0), a finite element program. The finite element analyses 35 results include elastic settlement, moments, and shears values of the concrete slab. The results were then 36 used to design slab depth and reinforcing. 37 Loads and load combinations were used as required by TFC-ENG-STD-06, REV A. As required, 38 AASHTO HB-16 loading was used with an HS 20-44 load wheel pattern. For maximum axle load, 39 40,000 pounds was used instead of 32,000 pounds as required per HS 20-44. An impact factor was also 40 applied as required by AASHTO HB-16. 41 The wheel pattern loading was arranged in three positions on the slab to yield the maximum moments and 42 shears. Supporting calculations and further discussions are presented in Appendix C.11.el. 43 The leachate loading support was analyzed as a post with a horizontal boom attached near the top of the 44 post. The design load included the dead weight of the post, boom, and piping full of water. Wind loads 45 were analyzed per ASCE 7-98. Appendix 4A. 1.69

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I In addition, the lateral load was compared with a 300-pound point load hanging vertically at the end of 2 the boom. The lateral wind load governed for overall overturning at the base of the post; however, the 3 300-pound point load governed for the boom attachment to the post. 4 In summary, a 10-inch by 10-inch tube for the post, with a 6-inch by 6-inch tube as the horizontal boom 5 welded to the post will suffice. The geotechnical engineer has verified that a 5-foot-6-inch-deep and 6 3-foot-diameter concrete encasement around the post will be sufficient for strength and stability. 7 Supporting calculations and further discussions are presented Appendix C. 11.e2. 8 5.12.3 Mechanical/Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) 9 5.12.3.1 Crest Pad and Leachate Transfer Building 10 Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) capacities were calculated for the crest pad and 11 leachate transfer buildings.

Additional capacity will compensate for battery cycling 18 deprivation. 19 5.13 Civil Grading 20 5.13.1 Waste Volume, Cut/Fill and Stockpile Requirement Calculations 21 The IDF is designed to provide the waste volume requirements identified by CH2M HILL. Those 22 requirements consist of an ultimate landfill capacity for 1,177,110 cubic yards of waste and a Phase 1 23 capacity of 213,515 cubic yards of waste. 24 The IDF is also designed to balance the cut and fill volumes of the project. The ultimate landfill layout 25 on the project site provides this balance. The volume balance includes excavated material, which will be 26 used for the construction of the closure cap. Since the closure cap will be selected and designed in the 27 future, assumptions for the cap layout and construction were made. 28 With a phased construction approach planned for IDF and the fact that'the material balance includes 29 backfill to construct a closure cap for the ultimate landfill, a substantial volume of material will be stored 30 in stockpiles at the completion of construction of Phase I landfill. The Phase I landfill design volumes for 31 subgrade cut, admix liner, drain gravel, and operations layer material were calculated using a 3-D 32 AutoCAD model of the landfill. These volumes were used to identify the stockpile requirements to store 33 material once Phase I construction is complete. Appendix 4A. 1.77

--- Page 163 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Potential stockpile locations are identified on the project site plan. Calculations of these volumes are 2 included in Appendix C.12.a. Calculations in Appendix C.12.a also present confirmation of the available 3 waste volume and cut/fill balance. 4 5.13.2 Phase I Access Road and Ramp Cross Section Design 5 Two cross sections using granular material for base and top course were designed for the Phase I landfill 6 access roads and the access ramp into the landfill. The design reflects the estimated wheel loads and 7 vehicles to use the facility daily. Calculations presenting the development of these cross sections are 8 included in Appendix C.12.b. 9 6.0 FACILITY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION 10 6.1 Facility Layout 11 6.1.1 Location 12 The IDF will be located approximately 1,400 feet east of Baltimore Avenue and directly north of 1st 13 Street in the 200 East Area of the Hanford Site. Phase I of the IDF landfill will measure approximately 14 800 feet by 1,500 feet, with its north-south axis being the shorter dimension. Leachate handling facilities 15 will be located immediately north of the Phase I cells. The excavated depth to subgrade (not including 16 sump depressions) will range from approximately 44 to 51 feet. Excavation will be deepest at the 17 landfill's north end, near the sumps and along the centerline of each cell. It will be shallowest at the 18 southwest and southeast corners of Cells 1 and 2, respectively. Stockpile locations for excavated 19 materials will be situated east and southeast of the Phase I landfill excavation. At the completion of 20 Phase I construction, exposed surfaces of the stockpiles and disturbed areas will be covered with a layer 21 of topsoil, then seeded and mulched. A borrow area of soil to supplement admix preparation is located 22 south of the Phase I excavation location. 23 6.1.2 Access Roads and Ramps 24 For access to Phase I of the IDF, waste hauler and operations vehicles will follow an access road and 25 travel north from 1st Street. All roads and ramps at the Phase I IDF site will be constructed with crushed 26 surfacing material for the base and top courses. The access road from 1st Street will be aligned with the 27 landfill's west berm access road. The road will also follow the alignment of the west access berm road 28 for the future IDF cells. 29 The access road will lead north, approximately 1,000 feet from 1st Street to where it widens into an 30 intersection. At this location, a turn to the east will lead down a 5 percent grade, 800-foot-long access 31 ramp into the Phase I landfill. The access ramp slope was selected to allow use by both waste haul trucks 32 and the melter transporter. The grade of the access road from 1st Street was also limited to a maximum of 33 five percent for this same reason. The access ramp into the landfill and the access road from 1st Street to 34 the intersection area will be both 30 feet wide. 35 At that base of the ramp into the landfill, there will be adequate room for waste haul vehicles to turn and 36 move the waste into the cells. The liner system will be installed to extend approximately 50 feet south 37 beyond the estimated toe of slope of Phase I waste placement. This extension will allow waste haul 38 vehicles to be staged or unloaded over a lined area. 39 At the access road intersection, continuing north will lead up a short ramp and onto the berm access road. 40 The berm access road will be 20 feet wide on the east and west sides of the landfill. The road will widen 41 to 30 feet at the northwest and northeast comers of the landfill and along the landfill's north side. 42 The wider road in these areas will allow operations vehicles to traverse around road comers and the crest 43 pad buildings. 44 The access road will continue from the northwest corner of the berm access road to the Cell 1 and Cell 2 45 leachate storage tank facilities. A cul-de-sac area will be provided just east of the Cell 2 leachate 46 facilities to provide a turnaround area for operations vehicles and leachate tanker trucks. Appendix 4A. 1.78

--- Page 164 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 A road will also be provided to allow operation vehicles to travel south between the leachate facilities and 2 onto the berm access road at the centerline of IDF landfill. 3 Future projects are being planned to upgrade the 1st Street pavement and construct an operation building 4 north of the IDF landfill. It is anticipated that these facilities will connect to access roads designed for the 5 Phase I landfill. 6 Related to permanent access roads and their use, the construction contractor will be required by the 7 project general requirements to submit a plan, which details their use during construction. This plan will 8 address locations and limits of stripping/grubbing, construction haul roads, stockpile/borrow areas and 9 other construction staging areas. 10 6.1.3 Survey Grids 11 Survey grids for this project use the Washington State Plane coordinate system (South Zone-feet, NAD83 12 Lambert Projection). Contours are based on 200 Area topographic mapping database, provided by 13 Hanford HGIS Department and dated 1991. A 1-foot contour interval was used on the design drawings. 14 As part of the Phase I landfill design, construction control points were developed for landfill and sump 15 subgrades as well as for the anchor trenches, stormwater facilities, and the finished grades for all roads 16 and ramps. North and east coordinates and elevations for these points are included in a survey control 17 table on Drawing H-2-830829, Sheet 2 of 2. The control points and lines between them will provide a 18 location grid that will allow construction of the subgrade, liner system, operations layer, and the finished 19 grades for the IDF. 20 6.2 Landfill Geometry 21 6.2.1 Waste Volumes and Types 22 6.2.1.1 Volume 23 Two key design criteria were provided by CH2M HILL concerning waste volumes: 24 * Phase I of the IDF should be designed to receive a waste volume of 213,515 cubic yards, which is 25 equal to163,250 cubic meters. CH2M HILL identified the waste volume for placement in all 26 phases of IDF (ultimate landfill size) as 1,177,110 cubic yards, or 900,000 cubic meters. 27 * Both the Phase I landfill and the ultimate landfill volumes should be sized for an air space, which 28 includes 1.5 cubic yards of clean fill for every cubic yard of waste. 29 * Using these criteria, Phase I was designed to provide air space for placement of 533,620 cubic 30 yards of waste and clean fill. 31 6.2.1.2 Waste Types 32 (Note: The disposal of MLLW other than ILAW, DBVS waste, and IDF generated waste is not permitted 33 at this time by this permit.) 34 The IDF will receive waste types including ILAW, DBVS Waste, and LLW. These wastes include both 35 contact and remote-handled wastes. As identified in the project kickoff meetings by CH2M HILL, the 36 waste volumes (in cubic yards) are estimated to include the following: 37 Appendix 4A.1.79

(FH). The waste 2 volume forecasts are updated by Hanford Site contractors on a regular basis. The volumes above 3 represent an average between the FH 2002 Forecast and the FH 1999 (with EIS) Forecast. Short 4 descriptions of the waste types are given below: 5 Immobilized Low-Activity Waste (ILAW)-The LAW packages are stainless steel cylinders that have 6 been filled with vitrified low-activity waste (physically similar to glass), sealed, and cooled. The source 7 of these waste cylinders is the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant. The packages are 7.5 feet in 8 height and 4 feet in diameter, and could weigh up to 22,050 pounds each. 9 Contact-Handled Mixed Low-Level Waste (CH MLLW)-This waste has a dose rate equal to or less 10 than 200 mrem/h and contains radioactivity not classified as high-level waste, spent nuclear fuel or 11 transuranic (TRU) waste (TRU is defined as concentrations of transuranic radionuclides greater than or 12 equal to 100nCi/g of the waste matrix). The waste is also defined as dangerous (hazardous) waste in 13 WAC 173-303. 14 Remote-Handled MLLW -This waste has a dose rate greater than 200 mrem/h and contains 15 radioactivity not classified as high-level waste, spent nuclear fuel, or TRU waste. The waste is also 16 defined as dangerous (hazardous) waste in WAC 173-303. 17 Low-Level Waste Category I (LLW I)-This waste contains radioactivity not classified as high-level 18 waste, spent nuclear fuel, or TRU waste. The waste also meets the radionuclide limits for category I 19 waste, defined in the Hanford Site Solid Waste Acceptance Criteria (RH, 1998). This waste may be 20 comprised of either contact- or remote-handled waste considered low-activity waste with very low 21 concentrations of long-lived radionuclides. This waste is not a dangerous (hazardous) waste as defined in 22 WAC 173-303. 23 Low-Level Waste Category III (LLW III)-This waste contains radioactivity not classified as high-level 24 waste, spent nuclear fuel, or TRU waste. The waste also exceeds the radionuclide limits for category I 25 waste and meets the category III limits, defined in the Hanford Site Solid Waste Acceptance Criteria (FH, 26 1998). This waste may be comprised of either contact- or remote-handled waste considered moderate- to 27 high-activity waste with low to moderate concentrations of long-lived radionuclides, in stabilized form 28 that minimizes subsidence for a period of 1,000 years. This waste is not a dangerous (hazardous) waste as 29 defined in WAC 173-303. 30 Remote-Handled LLW -This waste has a dose rate greater than 200 mrem/h and contains radioactivity 31 not classified as high-level waste, spent nuclear fuel, or TRU waste. This waste is not a dangerous 32 (hazardous) waste as defined in WAC 173-303. 33 6.2.2 Landfill Phases and Dimensions 34 The IDF will be a single, expandable RCRA Subtitle C disposal facility that provides ultimate capacity 35 for 1,177,110 cubic yards (900,000 cubic meters) of waste. The facility is currently anticipated to be 36 constructed in four phases. Phase I will have two cells. Only Phase I is being permitted at this time. 37 Each cell has a floor width of approximately 543 feet and a lined floor length of 360 feet. The total floor 38 width of the IDF will be 1,085 feet. Side slopes of the landfill will be 3:1 (horizontal: vertical). At the 39 south end of the Phase I cells, there will be a stormwater berm/ditch system with an infiltration area. The 40 south side of IDF will be unlined for Phase I. Appendix 4A. 1.80

--- Page 166 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 IDF will be expanded by relocation of the landfill's unlined south slope from earlier phases and 2 installation of liner system and operations layer. When expanded to its final configuration, the floor of 3 IDF will be 1,385 feet long, measured along its north-south axis. 4 6.2.2.1 Depth and Length 5 The landfill depth for all phases of the IDF is set to accommodate four layers of ILAW waste packages, 6 placed on end, and each layer will be covered with 3.3 feet of clean soil. In some cases, the waste 7 packages received for placement in the mixed and low-level waste side of IDF will have heights that vary 8 from the ILAW package dimensions. In these cases, waste heights will vary from the four layers of 9 ILAW waste described. The total depth, measured from the top of the operations layer to the top of the 10 cover layer over the fourth waste layer, will be 43.4 feet. This is sized for the 7.5-foot tall [LAW package 11 dimension. However, other waste package types can be accommodated. The waste/clean fill depth 12 (43.2 feet) will be uniform over the entire landfill floor, due to the operations layer and the top of the 13 landfill both sloping up 1 percent from north to south. The operations layer will be flat in the east-west 14 direction. 15 6.2.3 Materials Balance 16 The IDF was designed to achieve near soil balance. This will minimize excess soil stockpile at the end of 17 the life of the IDF facility and minimize the cost of hauling offsite borrow material for construction. It is 18 important to note that the soil balance was calculated for completing IDF through all its phases and the 19 balance included soil required for construction of the final closure cap. The closure cap design was not 20 part of the critical systems design, completed for this project. 21 Having a soil balance at the completion of all phases means that at the end of Phase I, a substantial 22 amount (approximately 991,000 cubic yards) of material will be stockpiled onsite. The project design 23 identified potential stockpile sites that were adequate in size for the material to be stockpiled. A portion 24 of the stockpiled material will be used as clean fill during the waste placement in the Phase I cells. 25 However, the stockpile will be replenished during the construction of cells for each subsequent IDF 26 phase. 27 A description of the resulting soil cut and fill volumes can be found in Appendix C.12.a of this Design 28 Report. 29 6.2.4 Erosion Control Measures 30 Permanent erosion control measures (for both wind and water caused erosion) will be provided for areas 31 disturbed by Phase I construction. 32 Areas that are disturbed by the construction that are outside of the Phase I excavation will be stabilized 33 with a 6-inch-thick layer of topsoil that will be seeded with grass. The south stormwater berm/ditch, the 34 east and west infiltration areas, and the soil stockpiles will also be stabilized with topsoil and grass. 35 Geotextile and quarry spalls will be placed around each end of the culverts and the stormwater pipe to 36 provide erosion protection. 37 Stormwater runoff will be conveyed along the south side of the access ramp and the south side of the flat 38 area at the bottom of the access ramp, and will be discharged to the southwest comer of the excavation 39 infiltration area. Road surfacing will reduce the erosion potential on the ramp and flat area. To prevent 40 erosion of the south side slope adjacent to the ramp and flat area, a strip of erosion control matting will be 41 installed on the south side slope, immediately adjacent to the ramp and flat area. Geotextile and quarry 42 spalls will be placed in the southwest corner of the excavation pond in order to minimize the potential of 43 erosion due to the stormwater that will be discharged from the south edge of the flat area to the top of the 44 infiltration area. 45 Erosion control matting will also be placed on the shine berm to minimize the potential for wind erosion. 46 The erosion control matting will be a plastic matting with an estimated service life at least equal to the 47 10-year period that the Phase I cells are expected to operate. Appendix 4A.I.81

--- Page 167 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 To reduce wind erosion, all of the side slopes of the Phase I excavation will be stabilized with a spray-on 2 application of a soil stabilization material. Additional applications of the soil stabilization material may 3 have to be done annually on the areas that remain exposed. 4 The contractor will also be required to prepare and implement a dust control plan for the construction. 5 6.3 Lining System Materials 6 6.3.1 Liner Selection Basis 7 WAC 173-303-665(2)(a)(i) requires submittal of an engineering report with the permit application under 8 WAC 173-303-806(4) stating the basis for selecting the liner(s). The report must be certified by a 9 licensed professional engineer. The intent of Section 6.3 of the Design Report is to satisfy this 10 requirement of the WAC 173-303, Dangerous Waste Regulations. 11 Specific requirements to address as the basis for liner selection include: 12 * The liner must be constructed of materials that have appropriate chemical properties and 13 sufficient strength and thickness to prevent failure due to pressure gradients (including static head 14 and external hydrogeologic forces), physical contact with the waste or leachate to which they are 15 exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation, and the stress of daily operation. 16 * The liner must be placed on a foundation or base that is capable of providing support to the liner 17 and is able to resist pressure gradients above and below the liner to prevent failure of the liner due 18 to settlement, compression, or uplift. 19 * The liner must be installed to cover all surrounding earth likely to be in contact with waste or 20 leachate. 21 * The lining system must include a LCRS immediately above the liner that is designed, constructed, 22 maintained, and operated to collect and remove leachate from the landfill. Design and operating 23 conditions will ensure that the leachate depth over the liner does not exceed 1 foot. The LCRS 24 shall be: 25 * Constructed of materials that are chemically resistant to the waste managed in the landfill and the 26 leachate expected to be generated, and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent failure 27 under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes, waste cover materials, and any equipment used 28 at the landfill. 29 * Designed and operated to function without clogging through the scheduled closure of the landfill. 30 0 Engineering analyses were presented in Section 5 that address the above requirements for basis of 31 lining selection. Of particular note is Section 5.6 that addresses lining system/leachate 32 compatibility for all components of the lining system. Compatibility of the lining system 33 components with the chemical and radiological constituents of the expected leachate is a critical 34 aspect of the liner selection basis. 35 * Based on results of the engineering analyses presented in Section 5, the following liner sections 36 are proposed for the IDF bottom (floor) and side slope lining systems. Section 6.3.2 provides a 37 detailed discussion of the liner materials for the barrier components of the lining system, and 38 Section 6.3.3 provides a detailed discussion of the liner materials for the drainage and protection 39 components of the lining system. 40 Drawing H-2-830838 (Detail 1) shows the bottom liner section, consisting of the following components, 41 from top to bottom: 42 * A 3-foot-thick operations layer 43 * A separation geotextile (polypropylene) 44 * A 1-foot-thick leachate collection drain gravel layer 45 * A minimum 12 oz/square yard cushion geotextile (polypropylene) 46 * A 60-mil textured primary HDPE geomembrane Appendix 4A. 1.82

--- Page 168 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * An internally-reinforced GCL 2 * A CDN drainage layer for the LDS 3 * A 60-mil textured secondary HDPE geomembrane 4 * A 3-foot-thick low-permeability compacted admix (soil-bentonite) liner 5 Drawing H-2-830838 (Detail 2) shows the side slope liner section, consisting of the following 6 components, from top to bottom: 7 * A 3-foot-thick operations layer 8 * A CDN drainage layer for the LCRS 9 * A 60-mil textured primary HDPE geomembrane 10 * A CDN drainage layer for the LDS 11 * A 60-mil textured secondary HDPE geomembrane 12 * A 3-ft-thick low-permeability admix liner 13 6.3.2 Liner Materials -Barrier Components 14 6.3.2.1 Geomembranes 15 WAC 173-303-665(2)(h)(i) requires that the IDF lining system have both a primary and secondary 16 geomembrane. The geomembrane for the IDF will serve as leachate barrier and as a flow surface routing 17 leachate to the LCRS sump (for the primary geomembrane) or LDS sump (for the secondary 18 geomembrane). 19 HDPE has been selected as the geomembrane liner material because it is generally acknowledged to have 20 the highest chemical resistance of commercially-available liner materials, has been widely used at similar 21 facilities, and has a high level of acceptance by regulatory agencies. Details of HDPE geomembrane 22 compatibility with expected leachate is discussed in Section 5.6. 23 A nominal thickness of 60-mil has been selected for the HDPE geomembrane. A nominal thickness of 24 60-mil results in a minimal allowable thickness of 54-mil, as indicated in the technical specifications. 25 Thus, 60-mil nominal thickness is the minimum required to achieve the 50-mil minimum thickness 26 specified by Ecology guidance. Textured (roughened) geomembrane will be used to maximize shear 27 strength along adjacent interfaces and to reduce the potential for sliding of the liner system. Analyses of 28 the various stresses that the geomembrane is designed to withstand under construction and operational 29 loads are presented in Section 5.5. Required material properties as a result of these analyses are included 30 in the technical specifications. 31 Details of required HDPE geomembrane properties are provided in the technical specifications (see 32 Section 02661). 33 6.3.2.2 GCL 34 A GCL will only be included in the primary bottom lining system. For the bottom lining system, both the 35 primary and secondary liners will be a composite (geomembrane over admix liner or GCL) system. The 36 addition of a GCL in the primary lining system will provide an extra measure of protection, exceeding the 37 requirements of WAC 173-303-665(2)(h)(i) for a single geomembrane for the primary liner and 38 composite for the secondary only. This will provide an extra measure of protection on the bottom flatter 39 slopes of the IDF, where higher leachate head levels are more likely. A GCL will not be included on the 40 side slope lining system. The 3H:IV side slopes for the IDF will result in little or no leachate head 41 expected on the side slope lining system, thus eliminating the need for a lining system design that exceeds 42 the WAC requirements. 43 Commercially-available reinforced GCL products consist of bentonite sandwiched between a woven and 44 non-woven geotextile that are then needle-punched together. Other combinations of upper and lower, 45 woven and non-woven geotextiles can also be manufactured and specified. Appendix 4A. 1.83

--- Page 169 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 For the IDF lining system, a needle-punched, reinforced GCL with non-woven geotextiles on both sides 2 was selected. This type GCL product was selected primarily because of the tensile strength requirements 3 required for landfill global stability (Section 5.1.3). The tighter weave non-woven geotextile minimizes 4 the amount of bentonite that migrates to the interface with the geomembrane, thus minimizing the 5 potential to create a slip surface. 6 Details of required GCL properties are provided in the technical specifications (see Section 02667). 7 6.3.2.3 Admix Liner 8 Details of the admix design test program are provided in Sections 4.2.2 and 5.4.1. Placement and testing 9 requirements are described in Section 5.4.2. 10 The admix liner will have a minimum 3-foot thick compacted soil/bentonite admixture and will be located 11 immediately beneath the secondary HDPE geomembrane, as required by WAC 173-303-665(2)(h)(i)(B). 12 The admix liner typically will consist of base soil mixed with a nominal 12 percent sodium bentonite, by 13 dry weight. Mixing and processing of the base soil/bentonite admixture is required to be performed under 14 carefully controlled conditions, using a pugmill operation. 15 The base soil for the admix liner will consist of natural soil, derived from the dune sand borrow area to 16 the south of the Phase I cell (as shown on Drawing H-2-830828) or from within Phase I cell excavations. 17 Based on the results of the limited field exploration for near surface base soil samples (discussed in 18 Sections 4.1 and 4.2), base soil from either source will not be excavated below a depth of 5 feet bgs (after 19 stripping) without further evaluation of the material suitability. 20 Base soils excavated from the dune sand borrow area or site excavation will meet the following 21 requirements: 22 * The base soil will be free of roots, woody vegetation, frozen material, rubbish, and other 23 deleterious material. 24 * Rocks greater than 1 inch in dimension will not comprise more than 2 percent by weight of the 25 base soil. 26 * Base soil will have 20 percent minimum passing a No. 200 U.S. sieve. 27 * The in-place hydraulic conductivity of the admix liner will be 10-7 centimeters per second or less, 28 consistent with WAC requirements for secondary soil liners. The upper surface of the admix 29 liner will be trimmed to the design grades and tolerances. The surface will be rolled with a 30 smooth steel-drum roller to remove all ridges and irregularities. The result will be a smooth, 31 uniform surface on which to place the overlying geomembrane liner. 32 * Before production installation of the admix liner, a full-scale test pad of the admix liner will be 33 conducted for both the bottom floor (horizontal) and side slope areas of the IDF. Details of the 34 test pads are provided in the technical specifications (see Section 02666) and the 35 IDF Construction QA Plan. The primary purpose of the test pad(s) will be to verify that the 36 specified soil density, moisture content, and hydraulic conductivity values will be achieved 37 consistently, using proposed compaction equipment and procedures. In-place density will be 38 measured using both the nuclear gauge (ASTM D2922) and rubber balloon (ASTM D2167) or 39 sand cone (ASTM D1556) methods. In-place hydraulic conductivity will be determined from a 40 two-stage borehole permeameter (ASTM D639 1). Admix liner hydraulic conductivity will be 41 estimated from thin-wall tube samples (ASTM D1587) obtained from the test fill and tested in the 42 laboratory (ASTM D5084). During construction, field density (e.g., ASTM D2922, D2167, 43 and/or D1556) and moisture content (ASTM D2216) will be measured periodically. Thin-wall 44 tube samples (ASTM D1587) will be taken at regular intervals and will be tested for hydraulic 45 conductivity (ASTM D5084). Additional details of Construction QA testing and acceptance 46 during admix liner test pad and production installation is provided in the IDF Construction QA 47 Plan. Appendix 4A.1.84

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Details of required admix liner properties and placement requirements are provided in the technical 2 specifications (see Section 02666). 3 6.3.3 Liner Materials-Drainage and Protection Components 4 6.3.3.1 Geotextiles 5 Two types and weights of geotextiles will be used in the IDF project. The separation (Type 1) geotextile 6 has a nominal weight of 6 ounce/square yard and was selected based on the ability of the geotextile to 7 retain the soil and to prevent the soil from entering the LCRS drain gravel. Required AOS and 8 permittivity were determined based on filter, fines retention, and clogging potential criteria. The waste 9 disposed in the IDF is expected to contain a minimal amount of organic material, and consequently, 10 biologic clogging is not expected to be a problem. 11 The cushion (Type 2) geotextile has a nominal weight of 12 ounce/square yard and was selected based on 12 providing the required cushion protection for geomembrane on the landfill bottom (floor). The drain 13 gravel will have the potential to produce localized stress on the geomembrane liner during gravel 14 placement with construction equipment and under the maximum static pressure from landfill contents at 15 full waste height with final cover. A puncture analysis was performed to select a sufficiently thick 16 geotextile to protect the liner. This analysis included the maximum load from landfill contents and final 17 cover, expected construction vehicle ground pressures, and maximum drain gravel particle size listed in 18 the technical specifications. 19 Both types of geotextiles are specified as non-woven needle-punched and made from polypropylene 20 material. This material was selected because of its higher chemical resistance to the expected leachate 21 (Golder Associates, 1991 a). 22 Details of required geotextile properties are provided in the technical specifications (see Section 02371). 23 6.3.3.2 CDN 24 The CDN is a drainage geocomposite consisting of a HDPE geonet core with a layer of non-woven 25 polypropylene geotextile thermally bonded to each side. The CDN selected for the IDF lining system has 26 two drainage related functions. On the side slopes, it will function as the LCRS. A CDN is selected for 27 the LCRS on the side slope to avoid construction stability problems associated with placement of clean 28 granular material on slopes, thereby minimizing the potential for damaging the underlying liner system. 29 Localized placement of drain gravel is required on side slopes (as shown on Drawing H-2-830848, 30 Section C), to provide adequate backfill and bedding for leachate collection riser piping. On the side 31 slope and bottom lining system, the CDN will function as the LDS. 32 Analyses were performed to evaluate the geotextile puncture requirements for the LCRS CDN on the side 33 slope and the transmissivity requirements for both the LCRS and LDS CDN. These analyses and 34 discussion are presented in Section 5.7. 35 The analyses for CDN geotextile puncture resistance determined that the specified geotextile is adequate 36 for resistance to puncture from overlying operations layer, under the maximum static pressure from 37 landfill contents. 38 The analyses for allowable transmissivity with applied reduction factors for intrusion, creep, and chemical 39 and biological clogging determined that a higher flow, thicker (250 mil minimum) CDN is required, due 40 to the reduction of flow under the high normal loads in the final filling configuration. 41 Details of required CDN properties are provided in the technical specifications (see Section 02373). 42 6.3.3.3 Drain Gravel 43 The LCRS for the bottom liner will be located below the operations layer and will provide a flow path for 44 the leachate flowing into the LCRS sump and sump trough. Between the operations layer and the 45 underlying drain gravel, a geotextile layer will function as a filter separation geotextile (as discussed in 46 Section 6.3.3.1). Appendix 4A.1.85

--- Page 171 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The separation geotextile will prevent migration of fine soil and clogging of the drain gravel. The gravel 2 will be a minimum 1-foot thick layer of washed, rounded to subrounded stone, with a hydraulic 3 conductivity of at least 10-2 cm/sec, as required by WAC 173-303-665(2)(h)(iii)(B). In addition, a slotted 4 HDPE leachate collection piping will be placed within the drain gravel to accelerate leachate transport 5 into the LCRS sump during high precipitation events. Slots on the leachate collection piping are sized to 6 be compatible with the drain gravel gradation and particle sizes. Details of the leachate collection piping 7 design are provided in Section 6.4.1. 8 Based on review of expected subsurface conditions for the IDF, it is not likely that material meeting drain 9 gravel is available on or near the site. Thus, drain gravel will have to be an imported material. The 10 technical specifications require that drain gravel meet the requirements of WSDOT Standard 11 Specification 9-03.12(4) for gradation. The technical specifications also require a performance 12 specification for a hydraulic conductivity greater or equal to 10-1 cm/sec. 13 As discussed in Section 5.7.3, the minimum estimated hydraulic conductivity for the drain gravel exceeds 14 the required (by WAC regulations) hydraulic conductivity of 10-2 cm/sec by a factor or 100 to 1,000, and 15 the performance specification hydraulic conductivity of 10-1 cm/sec by a factor of 10 to 100. This allows 16 for uncertainty in the empirical formulas used to predict hydraulic conductivity, and the potential for 17 long-term reduction in hydraulic conductivity in the drain gravel, if fines from waste filling and the 18 operations layer migrate into this layer over time. 19 Details of required drain gravel material properties are provided in the technical specifications (see 20 Section 02315). 21 6.3.3.4 Operations Layer 22 The purpose of the operations layer will be to protect the underlying lining system components from 23 damage by equipment and waste canisters during IDF construction and operation. This layer also will 24 protect the admix liner from freeze/thaw damage and desiccation cracking. This is especially the case on 25 the side slopes, expected to be exposed (prior to waste placement) for longer duration than the bottom 26 (floor) of the IDF cell. 27 The operations layer material typically will consist of onsite granular soil from the IDF Phase I 28 excavation. The excavated material is expected to be a fine-grained sand to silty sand with traces of 29 gravel. The technical specifications require the material to have a maximum particle size limit of 30 two inches or less, and fines will be limited to maximum 25 percent fines (percent passing the U.S. No. 31 200 sieve). Based on review of expected subsurface conditions for the IDF excavation, the majority of 32 soil excavated from the IDF Phase I excavation is expected to be suitable for use as operations layer 33 without processing, As discussed in Section 4, additional geotechnical exploration within the IDF Phase I 34 limits are recommended prior to construction to verify these findings. 35 Details of required operations layer material properties are provided in the technical specifications (see 36 Section 02315). 37 6.4 Leachate Collection System 38 The leachate collection system for each cell in Phase I will consist of lateral flow media built into the 39 cell's bottom and side slope liner system, a leachate collection pipe in the center of the cell, a sump at the 40 north end of the cell where all leachate drains, pumps and leachate transfer piping to convey leachate out 41 of the cell, and a network of piping and storage tanks for storing the leachate for later transfer to tanker 42 trucks for offsite disposal. Below the bottom liner and under the LCRS sump area will be an LDS sump, 43 pump, and associated piping. All components for Phase I of the leachate collection system are designed 44 and configured for eventual full development of the IDF through Phase IV. 45 The type and configuration of the leachate collection system described below has been used successfully 46 at other disposal facilities, and a very similar facility was recently (2002) implemented at the INEEL site 47 near Idaho Falls, Idaho. This ICDF will accept waste with radioactive characteristics and is located in a 48 region with dry weather conditions, similar to Hanford. Appendix 4A. 1.86

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 6.4.1 Leachate Collection Piping 2 6.4.1.1 Description 3 Lateral drainage media (drain gravel in the bottom liner section and CDN in the side slope section of each 4 cell) will convey leachate by gravity to the leachate collection piping and to the LCRS sump area. The 5 leachate collection piping system in both cells will have one 12-inch diameter HDPE slotted pipe running 6 the length of the cell centerline from south to north. This main collector pipe will be sloped at 1 percent 7 and will convey leachate from the south edge of the cell to the LCRS sump at the north end, where the 8 bottom liner will intersect the side slope liner. The main collection pipe will change to solid pipe at the 9 bottom of the side slope, continue up the side slope, and terminate at a cleanout, located just south of the 10 crest pad building. Leachate in the sump will be collected through perforated pipes for the LCRS low 11 flow and high flow pumps, which will be 12-inch and 18-inch HDPE slotted pipe, respectively. The riser 12 pipes will protect the pumps and separate them from the surrounding drain gravel, allow removal and re- 13 insertion of the pumps for maintenance, and provide a high inflow-rate screen for leachate to supply the 14 pumps. A small-diameter pipe (housing a transducer to control the on/off levels for the pumps) will run 15 from the LCRS sump up the side slope to the crest pad building. 16 The slotted portion of the riser pipes will extend from the toe of the side slope to the end of the LCRS 17 sump area. The transducer pipe will also be slotted but for a shorter distance in the LCRS sump, 18 whereupon it will be solid for the remaining distance to the crest pad building. A solid HDPE pipe (of the 19 same diameter as the slotted portion of the pump riser pipes) will extend from the intersection of the side 20 slope and bottom liner to the top of the shine berm where the pipes enter the crest pad building. 21 Pipe cleanouts will be provided at both ends of the main collection pipe in the center of each cell. The 22 cleanout at the north end of Phase I, near the crest pad building, will be permanently available throughout 23 the life of the IDF to allow access for cleaning and/or video inspection. The cleanout at the south end of 24 the cell will also be available for cleaning and access, but only during the operation of Phase I. It will be 25 removed and the Phase II collection pipe will be butt-fused to the pipe as the Phase II cell is brought 26 online. Ultimately, a permanent cleanout will be installed at the south end of Phase IV, to allow cleaning 27 and inspection of half of the collection pipe, with the other half being accessed by the permanent cleanout 28 located at the crest pad building on the north side of Phase I. 29 Access to the riser pipes for cleanout or inspection, in the unlikely event this is needed, will be through 30 the access points used for removal and re-insertion of the pumps within the crest pad building. 31 6.4.1.2 Design Considerations 32 The material chosen for piping within the Phase I lined area was HDPE , made of resin meeting the 33 requirements of ASTM D3350 for PE 3408 material, with a cell classification of 345434C or higher. 34 Design calculations were based on this material and pipe type, which is routinely used for leachate 35 collection and disposal facilities and other applications. The pipe material is well suited for use in 36 disposal facilities because of its high strength, high resistance to degradation from leachate constituents, 37 and superior characteristics compared to all other readily available pipe materials. HDPE compatibility 38 with leachate and the presence of radioactivity in the waste overlying the pipe were evaluated and 39 discussed previously in Section 5.6. 40 The diameter of the riser pipes was chosen to provide ample clearance for the pumps to be inserted and 41 removed on a routine basis, and specifically so that the pumps will have sufficient clearance when 42 traveling through the angle points at the intersection of the bottom liner and side slope, and clearance at 43 the radius transition from the side slope to the crest pad building. The pumps (described in Section 6.4.3) 44 are specifically designed for this type of leachate collection system, where the riser pipes allow insertion 45 of pumps down a side slope and into a sump area. 46 Lateral drainage media in the bottom liner and side slope liner, and the leachate collection piping system 47 were chosen and configured to meet the regulatory requirement of no more than 12 inches of leachate 48 head buildup over the sump area of the bottom liner as a result of a 25-year, 24-hour storm event. Appendix 4A.1.87

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The slots in the slotted pipe were designed to both be compatible with the granular material in the drain 2 gravel and to allow a high rate of flow from the surrounding lateral drainage layers into the pipe. Slots 3 were sized at 0.128 inches wide, with five rows of slots spaced equidistant around the perimeter of the 4 pipe, and eleven slots per foot of pipe. 5 The thickness of the pipes expressed as the SDR (standard dimension ratio) was chosen to resist the 6 highest estimated load for the IDF in its final configuration, including final cover and equipment loading 7 (internal pressure was not a factor since the pipe will convey flow by gravity, and under the expected flow 8 rates the pipes will only be partially full). A SDR of 17 was chosen for all piping to handle the maximum 9 estimated load. In addition, a blanket of manufactured drain gravel will be placed around and to the sides 10 of all collection piping and compacted to a firm, unyielding condition consistent with the soil modulus 11 values used in the pipe loading calculations. 12 All piping will be butt-fused for maximum strength, and all fittings, whether available molded from the 13 manufacturer or fabricated, will have the same or higher pressure rating than the pipe. During 14 construction, piping will be butt-fused by certified technicians, using welding equipment approved by the 15 manufacturer. All solid pipe will be pressure tested, even though the collection piping will see little or no 16 internal pressure during gravity conveyance of leachate. 17 6.4.2 Leachate Transfer Piping 18 6.4.2.1 Description 19 At each cell, the leachate transfer piping will begin with the piping from the pumps in the LCRS and LDS 20 sumps to the crest pad building. From the crest pad building, transfer piping will connect the leachate 21 transfer building, storage tank, and tanker truck load facility. All underground transfer piping outside the 22 Phase I liner limits will be double contained, that is the pressure pipe conveying leachate between various 23 facilities will be contained in an outer pipe. The pressure pipe in the center of the double containment 24 piping will be termed carrier pipe, while the outer pipe will be termed containment pipe. In the event of a 25 leak in the carrier pipe, the containment pipe or leak detection pipes draining the containment pipes will 26 convey the leakage to a combined sump facility for detection, sampling, and transfer. Any accumulation 27 of leachate in the combined sump will be pumped through a transfer pipe to the storage tank. Piping 28 within the crest pad building, transfer building, truck load facility, and combined sump, will not be double 29 contained because the buildings or facilities will provide secondary containment and have sumps present 30 to remove any leachate that accumulates as a result of leaking pipes or appurtenances. Leak detection 31 pipes draining containment pipes and the leak detection pipe from the storage tank will be single pipes 32 because they only will convey leakage and will not function as transfer piping (required to have double 33 containment). 34 The transfer piping system also will include valves, fittings, flow meters, and other appurtenances 35 necessary for operational functions for systems described in Sections 6.4.3, 6.4.4, and 6.4.5. 36 6.4.2.2 Design Considerations 37 All transfer piping outside of buildings will meet the same requirements as the HDPE pipe chosen for the 38 leachate collection piping (described in Section 6.4.1). Single pipe and containment pipe exposed to earth 39 and traffic loading will be SDR 17, while the carrier pipe, that will not be exposed to earth or traffic 40 loading, will be SDR 21, with a pressure rating of 80 psi and a safety factor of 2 for the highest expected 41 operating pressure in the system (SDR 17 piping has a pressure rating of 100 psi). All piping will be 42 butt-fused except for the transfer piping from the LCRS and LDS sump pumps. This pipe will be HDPE, 43 with quick release fittings to allow removal of the pumps from the sumps. Fittings will be pressure rated 44 and re-useable. As the pumps are withdrawn from the sumps and moved up the riser pipes, each joint in 45 the pipe will be unhinged to allow the pipe to be removed in 8-foot sections. 46 Piping inside buildings will be PVC, schedule 80, with solvent welded fittings. This pipe and 47 classification is rated for higher pressure than required with a factor of safety of 8. PVC was chosen for 48 application inside buildings because of its relative ease of fabrication with the solvent weld joint system. Appendix 4A.1.88

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Flange connections will be used between pumps and piping; valves and other appurtenances and piping; 2 and joints between PVC and HDPE piping. Appurtenances will include air release valves to allow 3 purging of any air trapped in the piping system, magnetic flow meters for measuring flow to the tanker 4 truck load output and to and from the leachate storage tanks, and valves for flow control and diversion of 5 flow between the various facilities. The flow control scheme and control logic for the transfer piping 6 system are described in Section 6.4.5. 7 6.4.3 Leachate System Pumps 8 Three submersible leachate pumps will be required for each cell. For convenience and operational 9 versatility, roller-mounted pumps were selected for all leachate removal facilities. The submersible 10 pumps are standard stainless steel well pumps that have been installed within a screened stainless steel 11 cylinder fitted with rollers. The configuration will allow the pumps to be installed from the crest pad 12 building within riser piping that follows the slope of the landfill until the riser piping bends horizontally 13 to terminate within the cell sump at the toe of slope. This type of pump can be lowered into the leachate 14 sump through the riser pipe and removed as needed, using a winch mounted within the crest pad building. 15 Each pump will have its foot valve removed to prevent freezing or retaining of the leachate in the pump 16 discharge piping. Advantages of this type of pump include easy access for maintenance and inspection, 17 no power equipment required to remove/install, and its small size will lend itself to being inserted within 18 a curved riser pipe and evacuating nearly all of the leachate within the cell sump. Each pump will have 19 the capability to pump either to the storage tank or truck loading station. 20 6.4.3.1 LCRS Pumps 21 Two of the three submersible pumps will be installed within the LCRS sump area of each cell above the 22 primary liner. These pumps are required to maintain less than 12 inches of hydraulic head above the 23 primary liner, per regulatory requirements. The pumps will be installed in a 6-inch depression within the 24 LCRS, in order to minimize the area of permanent leachate storage at pump shutoff and allow full pump 25 operation through the 12-inch maximum liner head zone over the primary liner. Only in the localized 26 area of the LCRS sump depression will a maximum leachate head of 18 inches cover the primary liner. 27 The leachate head over the primary liner will be maintained at or below 12 inches in the main sump area 28 and throughout the landfill. One low-flow pump is required for typical pumping of leachate; a high-flow 29 pump is necessary in the event that a large storm (24-hour, 25-year storm event) exceeds the capacity of 30 the low-flow pump. 31 The selection of the low-flow pump was based on the average leachate flow from the landfill, determined 32 in the leachate production analysis (Section 5.8.1). The analysis indicated that the maximum leachate 33 flow, based on monthly data, is approximately 13 gpm. The hydraulics of the low-flow pump was 34 modeled and a pump was selected, based on the hydraulic characteristics of the piping system and the 35 required flow rate, determined in the leachate system hydraulics analysis (Section 5.9.2.1). An EPG 36 Companies, Inc. (EPG) model WSD 3-3 (or equal) with a 0.5-horsepower motor was selected for the 37 LCRS low-flow pump. 38 The selection of the high-flow pump was based on the 24-hour, 25-year storm event, determined in the 39 leachate production analysis (Section 5.8.1). The analysis indicated that the high-flow pump capacity 40 necessary to remove the leachate per regulatory guidelines is approximately 160 gpm. The hydraulics of 41 the high-flow pump was modeled and a pump was selected, based on the hydraulic characteristics of the 42 piping system and the required flow rate, determined in the leachate system hydraulics analysis 43 (Section 5.9.2.1). An EPG model WSD 30-3 (or equal) with a 7.5-horsepower motor was selected for the 44 LCRS high-flow pump. 45 6.4.3.2 LDS Pump 46 The third submersible pump will be installed within each cell in the LDS sump, under the primary liner 47 and above the secondary liner. Appendix 4A.1.89

--- Page 175 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I This pump will detect and recover leachate that has leaked through the primary liner by pumping the 2 leachate to the crest pad building. This pump was sized for low leachate generation flows. 3 The hydraulics of the LDS pump were modeled and a pump was selected that can produce 4 gpm, based 4 on the hydraulic characteristics of the piping system and the required flow rate, identified in the leachate 5 system hydraulics analysis (Section 5.9.2.1). An EPG model 1.5-3 (or equal) with a 0.5-horsepower 6 motor was selected for the LDS pump. 7 6.4.3.3 Crest Pad Building Sump Pump 8 The sump pump within the crest pad building will be a submersible floor sump, activated by float 9 switches within the floor sump. The function of the sump pump is to remove leachate that accumulates in 10 the crest pad building as a result of unexpected spills or pipe leaks. The pump discharges water to the 11 leachate storage tank via the crest pad building discharge piping. 12 The hydraulics of the sump pump was modeled and a pump was specified, based on the hydraulic 13 characteristics of the piping system and the required flow rate identified in the leachate system hydraulics 14 analysis (Section 5.9.2.1). 15 6.4.3.4 Leachate Transfer Pump 16 The leachate storage tank will be drained by using the leachate transfer pump, located in the leachate 17 transfer building. The pump was sized to deliver a capacity of 250 gpm to the truck loading station, 18 where it will discharge into a tanker truck. The typical volume allowed in a tanker truck is 7,000 gallons, 19 corresponding to a loading time of approximately 30 minutes. 20 The hydraulics of the leachate transfer pump was modeled and a pump was selected, based on the 21 hydraulic characteristics of the piping system and the required flow rate, identified in the leachate system 22 hydraulics analysis (Section 5.9.2.1). A standard horizontal centrifugal pump, Paco model 30707 (or 23 equal) with a 3-horsepower motor was selected for the leachate transfer pump. 24 6.4.3.5 Combined Sump Pump 25 The combined sump will be a 76-inch-diameter HDPE manhole with a 42 inch diameter HDPE manhole 26 placed inside. The outer manhole will have a height of approximately 8 feet, and the inner manhole 27 height will be approximately 6 feet. The secondary containment portion of all the buried HDPE pipelines, 28 leachate tank, and leachate transfer building floor sump will drain to the annular space (leak detection 29 chamber) between the two manholes. The leak detection chamber will include instrumentation to detect 30 leachate and alarm accordingly. The sumps installed within the truck loading slab typically will collect 31 precipitation that drains off the slab. The precipitation will be conveyed directly to the inner manhole of 32 the combined sump, where the combined sump pump will be located. The combined sump pump then 33 will pump the precipitation to the leachate storage tank. 34 The combined sump pump was conservatively sized for a capacity of 250 gpm. This large capacity was 35 chosen based on an off-normal event that assumed the tanker truck was overtopped during leachate 36 transfer activities, resulting in 250 gpm flowing into the inner sump. Another off-normal event 37 considered was the remote possibility that the leachate tank primary liner failed catastrophically. This 38 flow of leachate could eventually inundate the leak detection chamber and overflow into the inner 39 manhole. 40 The hydraulics of the combined sump pump was modeled and a pump was selected based on the 41 hydraulic characteristics of the piping system and the required flow rate, identified in the leachate system 42 hydraulics analysis (Section 5.9.2.1). A Hydromatic model SB3S (or equal) with a 3-horsepower motor 43 was selected for the combined sump pump. Appendix 4A. 1.90

--- Page 176 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 6.4.4 Leachate Temporary Storage Tank 2 6.4.4.1 Tank Volume 3 A leachate temporary storage tank is required for each cell. The working capacity of each tank is 375,000 4 gallons that include a 1.5 safety factor. This volume is based on the results of the leachate production 5 analysis (Section 5.8.1) and the leachate collection storage analyses (Section 5.9.2.4). The storage tank 6 capacity is dependent on the net volume of leachate accumulation in the tank from flow into and out of 7 the tank. The flow out of the tank via the leachate transfer pump is based on several assumptions, 8 described in Section 5.9.2.4. Actual leachate transfer operations will affect the tank volume safety factor. 9 6.4.4.2 Tank Design 10 A bolted, corrugated steel tank, approximately 100 feet in diameter with a side wall height of 8 feet 11 2 inches, was selected for use as the leachate temporary storage tank. The tank will include a dual 12 containment liner system that will act as the floor of the tank and will be bolted to the top of the tank side 13 wall. The tank will be open-topped with a floating geomembrane cover to keep precipitation, debris, and 14 wildlife from contacting the leachate. 15 The tank side wall will be bolted to a 1.5-foot thick, 4-foot-deep concrete ringwall to resist hydrostatic 16 pressure of the leachate water. In addition, the top edge of the tank ringwall will include angle bracing, 17 bolted around the tank perimeter to provide rigidity in the side wall to resist wind loads on the exterior of 18 the tank. The maximum operating level of the tank is approximately 6 feet 2 inches; however, the tank is 19 designed for a maximum water level of 8 feet 2 inches. 20 The inlet piping for the tank will be through the side wall of the tank. The inlets will all be located near 21 the top of the tank, above the maximum leachate water operating level. This is to ensure that a siphon 22 cannot develop in the inlet piping. Check valves will be installed throughout the system; however, if 23 piping between the check valve and the tank leaked into the secondary containment system, there would 24 not be an easy method of stopping the flow if the pipe was below the water surface of the tank. 25 The outlet pipe for the tank will be through the side wall, near the bottom of the tank. This method was 26 chosen to provide a flooded suction for the leachate transfer pump that will provide added protection 27 against pump damage. 28 6.4.4.3 Tank Liners 29 The tank liners will be constructed with an XR-5 geomembrane. XR-5 is a proprietary geomembrane 30 manufactured by Seaman Corporation. XR-5 is the preferred liner of several tank manufacturers due to 31 its higher strength properties and lower thermal expansion coefficient, as compared to HDPE 32 geomembrane. As such, it is more readily constructible in the tank configuration, and it does not expand 33 and contract as much as HDPE, so it's operating performance over the temperature range at Hanford 34 should be improved. For the exposed condition at the IDF tanks, this is an important consideration. 35 HDPE was considered for use as the tank liner system, but its high coefficient of expansion will not lend 36 itself to the temperature extremes that the liner system will be subjected to and also it is not reinforced 37 like the XR-5. The expansion and contraction of an HDPE liner exposed to the environment could put 38 undue strain at the inlet and outlet connections as well as at the leak detection connection that could result 39 in liner leakage. 40 Chemical compatibility of leachate with the liner system is also a consideration for liner material 41 selection for the leachate storage tanks. As discussed in Section 5.6.3.1, compatibility testing on HDPE 42 geomembrane was performed with synthetic leachate for the W-025 landfill with no evidence of 43 geomembrane deterioration. With regard to leachate compatibility, XR-5 is comparable to HDPE in 44 terms of compatibility with typical leachate constituents. The geomembrane manufacturer requires 45 immersion testing for conclusive compatibility determination. Testing of this type has not been 46 performed, but the manufacturer is confident that immersion testing results will be acceptable since XR-5 47 is generally comparable to HDPE. Appendix 4A. 1.91

--- Page 177 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I To address the issue of chemical and radiation resistance for XR-5 with anticipated leachate constituents, 2 an immersion test program is included in the technical specifications for the tank liner. Details are 3 provided in Section 13205 of the technical specifications. This immersion testing program requires the 4 construction general contractor to submit tank liner sample coupons to the design engineer for immersion 5 testing, as part of the construction submittal process and certification of the tank liner. 6 In addition, it should be noted that leachate compatibility is not as critical an issue for the tank system as 7 compared to the landfill liner system. The leachate tank liner system will be subject to continuous 8 monitoring through the tanks' LDS, as is the landfill liner system. The difference is that the tank liners 9 will be subject to routine maintenance and inspection that will be developed around liner warranty, 10 performance observation, and manufacturer's requirements. Operation and maintenance procedures for 11 the tank will be established that require that the tanks be drained, sediment removed, and the liner 12 inspected for holes and seam integrity. Since liner performance guarantees are required in the technical 13 specifications for the tank manufacturer for three years following installation, it is likely that the 14 inspection program would be initially set up around this time frame and gradually be increased over the 15 life cycle of the tank. Replacement of the leachate tank liner system is anticipated periodically 16 throughout the life cycle of the landfill. 17 The tank lining system is a double-lined system. The primary and secondary tank liners will include a 18 LDS beneath the primary tank liner. The LDS consists of a HDPE drainage net with a geotextile material, 19 laminated to the drainage net that cushions the XR-5 liner. A geotextile material will also be used 20 between the secondary liner and the inside face of the tank shell to create a cushion for the XR-5 against 21 the tank shell and tank shell bolt heads. The bolt heads are also recessed for further liner protection. 22 6.4.4.4 Tank Leak Containment System 23 The HDPE drainage net between the primary and secondary liner will allow leachate that leaks through 24 the primary liner to drain to the center of the tank. At the center of the tank under the secondary liner will 25 be a depression in the underlying granular backfill that will form a shallow sump. The leak detection pipe 26 will connect to the secondary liner at this sump location and convey leaking leachate to the leak detection 27 chamber of the combined sump. 28 The tank inlet and outlet penetrations will be areas susceptible to leaks as a result of penetrations through 29 the primary liner. Additional robust methods for sealing these locations were added over and above the 30 typical manufacturer recommendations in an effort to make sure that these will not be points of leakage. 31 6.4.5 Pump Controls and System Instrumentation 32 The process and instrumentation diagrams for Cell I and Cell 2 are shown on Drawing H-2-830854, 33 sheets I through 4. Detailed information regarding the instrumentation and control system, equipment 34 listing, instrument listing, and loop descriptions can be found in the technical specifications, Section 35 13401 (Process Instrumentation and Control System). 36 6.4.5.1 Crest Pad Building 37 The leachate pumps within the landfill will be automatically controlled, based on leachate level set points 38 within the cell sump. The level transducer that controls the LCRS pumps will be inserted into the sump 39 via a slope riser pipe. The level transducer that controls the LDS pump is integral to the LDS pump. 40 Leachate pumped by the leachate pumps will be monitored by a flow-indicating totalizer within the crest 41 pad building. Controls will be in place to stop automatically the leachate pumps operation if alarm 42 conditions are present for the leachate storage tank high-high level, leak alarm in the crest pad building 43 sump, or a leak alarm in the combined sump. 44 The crest pad building sump pump will be automatically controlled by float switches within the building 45 floor sump. In addition, a leak detection switch will be installed in the floor sump that will be capable of 46 detecting small quantities of water in the sump before the float switches. This feature will add an extra 47 level of conservatism to make sure unexpected spills are identified and controlled immediately. Appendix 4A. 1.92

--- Page 178 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Controls will be in place to stop automatically the crest pad building sump pump operation if alarm 2 conditions are present for the leachate storage tank high-high level or for a leak alarm in the combined 3 sump. 4 6.4.5.2 Leachate Transfer Building 5 The leachate transfer pump will be manually controlled except for automatic shut-off during specific 6 alarm events. Controls will be in place to stop automatically the transfer pump operation if alarm 7 conditions are present for the leachate storage tank low-low level or for leak alarm in the combined sump. 8 Additional instrumentation (associated with the leachate transfer pump) will include a flow meter 9 (measuring rate and total volume) and transmitter on the discharge of the leachate transfer pump. In 10 addition, a local totalizer will be in the leachate transfer building to know exactly how much water is 11 being transferred to the tanker truck. This totalizer will include a reset function to allow the total to be 12 reset to zero, prior to every truck loading event. 13 6.4.5.3 Leachate Storage Tank 14 Instrumentation within the leachate storage tank will be contained within two vertical stilling wells that 15 will penetrate through openings in the floating cover. The stilling wells will be small diameter pipe with 16 perforations near the bottom that will allow the leachate within the stilling well to rise and fall with the 17 level of the leachate in the tank. Analog instrumentation within one stilling well will provide a signal to 18 the control system for alarm interlocks and constant monitoring of tank level. The second stilling well 19 will contain discrete instrumentation for high-high and low-low alarm set point trips. The discrete 20 instrumentation will provide conservatism in the off chance that the analog signal malfunctions, allowing 21 the leachate level to reach extreme high or low levels. 22 6.4.5.4 Combined Sump 23 The combined sump pump will be automatically controlled by float switches within the inner manhole of 24 the combined sump. Controls will also be in place to stop automatically the combined sump pump 25 operation if alarm conditions are present for the leachate storage tank high-high level. A leak detection 26 switch also will be installed within the leak detection chamber that will be capable of detecting a small 27 quantity of water. The leak detection switch will provide a signal to the control system that automatically 28 will shut down all the cell pumps except the combined sump pump. The pumps will be shut down 29 because any one of the pipelines associated with the pumps could be leaking into the leak detection 30 chamber. Operations will then need to determine which secondary containment pipeline supplied the 31 water that drained into the leak detection chamber. 32 6.4.6 Process Instrument Control System (PICS) 33 6.4.6.1 Introduction 34 This section provides a summary of the PICS design and construction elements of the project, providing 35 introduction and reference to the project layout and key design components for the following IDF 36 facilities: 37 * IDF leachate collection and handling crest pad facilities (two each) 38 * IDF leachate storage tank and leachate transfer facilities (two each) 39 * IDF truck loading facilities (two each) 40 The PICS design identifies, specifies and integrates PICS components to automatically monitor and 41 control IDF process control equipment and facilities including: 42 * LCRS 43 * LDS 44 * Crest pad and leachate transfer building environmental controls 45 * Leachate storage tank system Appendix 4A. 1.93

OIU and process flow and level indicators are mounted on front doors of 10 control panels. 11 The PICS design identifies local control panels, integrating discrete level instrumentation, control relays, 12 intrinsic safety relays, and providing interlock signals between PLC architecture and MCC pump controls. 13 6.5 Stormwater Management 14 The proposed stormwater system to be constructed just south of the south end of the Phase I excavation 15 will intercept stormwater runoff from the area to the south for the 24-hour, 25-year storm event so that it 16 will not flow into the Phase I excavation and will discharge the intercepted stormwater into the ground via 17 infiltration. This system will consist of the south stormwater berm/ditch, two culverts, and the east and 18 west infiltration areas. The berm will be two feet high above the existing ground surface. The minimum 19 combined depth of the berm and ditch will be two feet. The ditch will be V-shaped with 3:1 side slopes. 20 The culverts will be 18-inch-diameter, corrugated polyethylene pipe with smooth interior. Geotextile and 21 quarry spalls will be placed around each end of the culverts to provide erosion protection. The east and 22 west infiltration areas will have bottom lengths of 220 and 225 feet, respectively. Each of the infiltration 23 areas will have a bottom elevation of 719 feet and a bottom width of 15 feet. In order to allow access for 24 future maintenance into each of these infiltration areas, their north and south ends will be sloped at 15 25 percent and surfaced with quarry spalls placed on a geotextile. 26 The proposed stormwater system to be constructed at the south toe of slope within the Phase I excavation 27 will intercept stormwater runoff from the unlined portions of the excavation for the 24-hour, 25-year 28 storm event so that it will not flow into the active cells and will discharge the intercepted stormwater into 29 the ground via infiltration. This system will consist of the excavation stormwater berm/ditch, a 30 stormwater pipe, one catch basin, and the excavation infiltration area. There also will be a flow path 31 along the south side of the access ramp that will continue along the south side of the flat area at the base 32 of the access ramp and into the southwest corner of the excavation infiltration area. The south stormwater 33 berm/ditch will slope to drain to the east. The combined depth of the berm and ditch will be two feet. 34 The stormwater berm will be 2 feet high at its west end, and the corresponding depth of the ditch will be 35 zero. The berm will gradually reduce in height as the depth of the ditch increases. The berm will end 36 when the ditch depth reaches 2 feet. The ditch will be V-shaped with 3:1 side slope on the south and 2:1 37 side slope on the north. The stormwater pipe will be 18-inch-diameter corrugated polyethylene pipe with 38 smooth interior. Geotextile and quarry spalls will be placed around each exposed end of the stormwater 39 pipe to provide erosion protection. The catch basin will be used to lower the elevation of the stormwater 40 pipe so that there will be adequate cover over the pipe for protection against wheel loads. The infiltration 41 area will have a bottom elevation of 678 feet, a bottom width of 15 feet, and a bottom length of 50 feet. 42 In order to allow access for future maintenance into this infiltration area, the west end will be sloped at 15 43 percent and surfaced with quarry spalls placed on a geotextile. 44 If the water builds up in the east or west infiltration area, it will eventually flow out of the north end of the 45 infiltration area. The water would flow overland, north along the toe of the fill for the berm access road, 46 and continue generally northward. 47 If the water builds up in the excavation infiltration area so that it extends into the ditch, then the operator 48 will have to bring in a portable pump and pump the water into the east infiltration area. Appendix 4A. 1.97

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Maintenance for each of the infiltration areas, the ditches, and the ends of each of the culverts and 2 stormwater pipes will be primarily to remove accumulated sediment and debris. 3 6.6 Building Systems 4 6.6.1 .Crest Pad Buildings 5 The crest pad building is designed as a pre-engineered, rigid frame metal building on a slab-on grade 6 foundation. The building slab is separated into two portions. The lower portion of the slab is where the 7 piping associated with the leachate pipe will be contained, and the higher slab is where the electrical and 8 control equipment will be located. The slab where the leachate piping will be located is lowered to create 9 a containment area for the leachate. Construction joints within this area have waterstops to ensure that 10 leachate cannot egress through the construction joints. Additionally, a sump has been placed to drain the 11 containment area, if required. The entire floor and sump area also is to be coated to provide even greater 12 resistance to the leachate. 13 6.6.2 Leachate Transfer Buildings 14 The leachate transfer building is designed as a pre-engineered, self-framing metal building on a slab-on- 15 grade foundation. The metal building is supported on an 8-inch curb that travels continuously around the 16 exterior of the building. The curb is continuous, even through the door threshold, to provide a 17 containment area for the leachate in case of spillage. In order to maintain conformance with building 18 code requirements, a landing is used to eliminate the curb tripping hazard at the door threshold. 19 Construction joints within this area have waterstops to ensure that leachate cannot egress through the 20 construction joints. Additionally, a sump has been placed to drain the containment area, if required. The 21 entire floor and sump area also is to be coated to provide even greater resistance to the leachate. 22 6.6.3 Truck Loading Station 23 The truck loading station is designed to receive trucks to load with leachate. The station is essentially a 24 slab-on-grade. The station is designed to contain minor spillage of leachate by sloping the floor slab 25 towards the center and using rounded curbs at the slab entrance and exits. Two sumps will be placed in 26 the center of the station to drain the station as required. The entire floor and sump area also is to be 27 coated to provide even greater resistance to the leachate. 28 6.7 Electrical Service and Lighting 29 6.7.1 Introduction 30 This section provides a summary of the electrical design and construction elements of the project, 31 providing introduction and reference to the project layout and key design components for the following 32 IDF facilities: 33 * IDF leachate collection and handling crest pad facilities (two each) 34 * IDF leachate storage tank and leachate transfer facilities (two each) 35 * IDF truck loading facilities (two each) 36 The electrical design identifies, specifies, and integrates power distribution systems that incorporate 37 transformers, breaker panels, motor control, safety switches, conductors, and lighting for the safe, 38 reliable, and maintainable operation of IDF process and facility equipment including: 39 * Process equipment (leachate collection and removal pump motors, leak detection pump motors, 40 transfer pump motors, and instrumentation) 41 0 Building facility equipment (lighting, power outlets, heating units, cooling fans, and building 42 sump pumps) 43 * Personnel and equipment safety systems (standby egress lighting, process alarm lighting, surge 44 protection, and process piping heat trace) 45 * Electrical design and installation shall be in accordance with NFPA 70 (NEC, 2002) Appendix 4A. 1.98

In the event of a phase loss or phase reversal condition, the protection relay will shunt the MCC 10 main service breaker. With main service breaker shunted (open), a UPS mounted inside each PICS main 11 control panel will continue the operation of voltage sensitive PICS equipment (i.e., PLC, OIU, local area 12 network communication), allowing for future remote alarming (future SCADA) and the safe shutdown of 13 sensitive equipment. 14 Incoming power is also monitored through the use of analog-style voltage and current meters. Operators 15 will be able to observe operating status of incoming power by manually selecting analog-style voltage and 16 current meters to Phase A, Phase B, and Phase C. 17 MCC associated gear (frame, bussing, and feeder protective devices) were sized to adequately and safely 18 handle the calculated design and demand operating loads, and to safely withstand calculated short circuit 19 interrupting currents. 20 6.7.6 Utilization Voltages 21 The electrical design identified utilization voltages for the following equipment and systems: Equipment or System Voltage, Phase Lighting 120 V, 1-4 Heat trace 120 V, 1-4 Convenience outlets 120 V, 1-4 Instrumentation control circuits 24 V DC Motor control 120 V, 1-4 Air conditioner 208 V, 1-4 Motors, less than 1/3 hp 120 V, 1-4 Motors, 1/3 hp and larger 480 V, 3-4 Unit heaters 480 V, 3-4 Instrument power 120V, 1-4 22 6.7.7 Leachate Transfer Building Electrical Service 23 The electrical design identified three phase motor loads inside leachate transfer buildings as being 24 powered from MCC, located inside each crest pad building.

Style of feeder and branch circuit breakers will be thermal-magnetic. 19 6.7.10 Raceways 20 480V power circuits-Standard rigid galvanized steel (RGS) in exposed locations, PVC conduit systems 21 will be buried, RGS will be coated when conduits transition from below grade to above grade areas 22 120V power circuits-Standard RGS in exposed locations, PVC conduit systems buried, RGS coated 23 when conduits transition from below grade to above grade areas. 24 6.7.11 Raceway Sizing, Selection, and Installation Guidelines 25 The electrical design identified conduit wire fill and size, based upon THW (thermoplastic, vinyl 26 insulated building wire; flame retardant, moisture and heat resistant, 750C, dry and wet locations) 27 insulated conductors for wiring 600 volts and below. Minimum raceway sizes will be as follows in the 28 designated locations: Minimum Raceway Size: Location: 3/4-inch Exposed on walls and ceiling 3/4-inch Concealed in frame construction and finished ceilings 1-inch Underground for circuits below 600 volts, including instrumentation 3-inch Fiber optic 29 The electrical design identified underground raceways assemblies as concrete duct bank constructed. 30 6.7.12 Wire and Cable 31 The electrical design identified stranded copper conductors that will be used for all wiring, except for 32 lighting and receptacle circuits where solid copper will be used. Appendix 4A.1.101

FVNR combination motor starter assemblies 14 will consist of thermal-magnetic, trip-molded case circuit breakers; full voltage combination starters; 15 control power transformers; indicating lights; and control switches. All combination motor starters will 16 be operated in AUTO mode by PICS. 17 6.7.15 Overload Protection 18 The electrical design identified each motor as being provided with thermal overload protection in all 19 ungrounded phases. Each controller will be provided with overload heaters and controller-mounted relays 20 with external manual reset. 21 6.7.16 Grounding 22 The electrical design identified the grounding electrode system for each IDF facility, integrating ground 23 ring rods, and connection to building rebar. The electrical design identified electrical service neutral, and 24 the neutrals of derived sources, electrical equipment, and PICS control panels that will be bonded to 25 grounding electrode systems. 26 6.7.17 Equipment Grounding 27 The electrical design identified noncurrent-carrying parts of all electrical equipment, devices, 28 panelboards, and metallic raceways that will be bonded to grounding system. 29 The electrical design identified noncurrent-carrying parts of all mechanical equipment, to which electrical 30 components will be attached and may potentially become energized, that also will be bonded to the 31 grounding system, including building metal structures and leachate storage tank. 32 All conduits that will be provided have an equipment grounding conductor. 33 6.7.18 Lighting 34 The electrical design identified lighting fixtures that will be installed at each IDF facility to maintain an 35 average 25-foot candle inside each building, and 5-foot candles at entrance doorways. 36 Note: Interior lighting levels are based upon IES Lighting Handbook Indoor Industrial Areas 37 Recommended Illuminance Levels for interior activities inside work spaces where visual tasks of medium 38 to large contrast are to be performed on occasional basis. 39 Note: Exterior entrance lighting levels are based upon IES Lighting Handbook Outdoor Site/Area 40 Recommended Illuminance Levels for building exterior entrances frequently visited locations. 41 6.7.19 Emergency Lighting System 42 The electrical design identified emergency illumination (battery-pack wall-mounted units or luminaries 43 powered by integral battery-powered ballasts) that will be provided in all IDF facilities.

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 6.7.20 Circuiting and Switching 2 The electrical design identified interior process area lighting, switched to provide adequate lighting. 3 Exterior building lighting will be controlled by photocells. 4 6.7.21 Heat Trace 5 The electrical design identified electrical heat trace for above grade process piping freeze protection. 6 Heat trace cable will be the self-limiting type with the overall system controlled by an ambient control 7 thermostat. Heat trace design incorporates circuit power indication. 8 6.7.22 Hazardous Classification 9 The electrical design identified the interior of the combined sump as Class 1, Division 2 group, 10 C hazardous. The electrical design for the combined sump will incorporate materials and intrinsic safety 11 devices compatible for the installation of electrical equipment in Class 1, Division 2, Group C hazardous 12 locations. 13 6.8 Construction QA Requirements 14 The Construction QA Plan describes the QA activities for constructing the Phase I IDF. QA activities 15 will be required during construction to ensure the following: 16 * Firm and stable foundation system for liners 17 * Stability of dikes or embankments 18 * Low permeability soil liners that inhibit contaminant migration 19 * Geosynthetic layers that function as either a hydraulic barrier or a drainage system, depending on 20 intended function 21 * LCRS and LDS that remove leachate and control head on the lining systems 22 * The Construction QA Plan has been prepared to describe the activities that will be performed 23 during construction of the lining system, leachate collection system, and operation layer of Cell 1 24 and Cell 2. The Construction QA Plan satisfies the regulatory requirements and guidance 25 established in 40 CFR 264.19, the EPA technical guidance document, Quality Assurance and 26 Quality Control for Waste Containment Facilities (EPA 1993), and WAC 173-303-335. 27 The specific physical components that the WAC requires the Construction QA Plan to address include: 28 * Foundations 29 * Dikes 30 * Low-permeability soil liners 31 * Geomembranes 32 * LCRS and LDS 33 * Final cover systems 34 * The WAC requires the Construction QA Plan to include the following: 35 * Identification of applicable units and how they will be constructed 36 * Identification of key personnel 37 * Description of inspection and sampling activities 38 The Construction QA Plan is intended to be implemented by an independent, qualified Construction QA 39 certifying engineer, familiar with EPA's technical guidance document, Quality Assurance and Quality 40 Control for Waste Containment Facilities, as well as the Construction QA Plan. The Construction QA 41 certifying engineer will be supported by other Construction QA representatives, as necessary, to 42 implement the requirements in the Construction QA Plan and document the work. Appendix 4A.1.103

--- Page 189 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The Construction QA Plan establishes general administrative and documentation procedures that will be 2 applicable for selected activities of construction. The Construction QA Plan addresses only those 3 activities associated with the soils, geosynthetics, and related liner and leachate collection system piping 4 components for the Phase I IDF landfill. Other aspects of construction, such as transmission piping, 5 utilities, concrete, and storage tanks will require QA testing and oversight. These requirements are not 6 mentioned in the Construction QA Plan, but they will be included in future construction inspection 7 documents, accompanying the bid-ready drawings and specifications. 8 6.9 Interface with Non-Critical Systems 9 Critical systems for the Phase I IDF include three primary design components: 10 * Liner systems 11 * LCRS 12 * LDS 13 In addition, the Phase I IDF detailed design also involves completing all design work required for an 14 operable landfill. 15 Non-critical systems for the Phase I IDF include the following components: 16 * Entrance facilities, including entrance area, scales, and staging areas 17 * Administration and control facilities 18 * Waste delivery access road improvements to the IDF site from the WTP 19 * Waste treatment and staging areas 20 * Gates and fences 21 * Utilities including fire protection, process water, electrical power, or instrumentation cables 22 The IDF Phase I Critical Systems design has been prepared to interface with these non-critical systems 23 that are necessary for operational readiness for the IDF. The following discussion details interface 24 elements of the current design with these non-critical systems. 25 There is the potential for the DOE to procure an independent contractor to provide operation and 26 maintenance services for the IDF. These services could also include the detailed design and construction 27 of a portion or all of the non-critical systems for the facility. If this should be the case, careful 28 consideration will be given to these interface elements in the development of performance criteria that 29 will be included as part of any contract package for these services. 30 6.9.1 Entrance Facilities 31 Entrance facilities will control the flow of waste into the IDF. These facilities will provide for waste 32 delivery, inspection, check-in, and final authorization for disposal into the IDF. Typically, the location 33 for the entrance facilities is adjacent to the in-bound access road, prior to reaching the disposal area. 34 Other factors that can influence their location include access to existing utilities and other operational 35 facilities such as waste treatment, soil stockpiles, or staging areas. Based on the current configuration 36 planned for the IDF, there will be room for entrance facilities to the south of the Phase I disposal area, 37 along the western access road. Typically, these facilities require connection to such utilities as fire 38 protection, power, and process water. Utility interfaces are discussed later in this section. 39 Design criteria and detailed design elements for the IDF entrance facilities have not been developed. The 40 overall mission for the facility has expanded from handling just the ILAW packages to other wastes 41 including Waste from the DBVS and LLW materials. This may require the entrance facilities to have 42 expanded capabilities for waste load staging, inspection, verification, and scaling, prior to release for 43 disposal into the IDF. This could impact the location selected for the entrance facilities, since complete 44 development of the IDF to its full capacity will leave little room to the south of the southern perimeter 45 berm for the facility (refer to Drawing H-2-830827). Appendix 4A.1.104

--- Page 190 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 This could require the entrance facilities to be located along 1st Street, if a permanent initial location is 2 desired. Otherwise, a more mobile entrance area could be developed and relocated along with phased 3 development of the facility. 4 6.9.2 Administration and Control Facilities 5 Administration and control facilities will provide the control center for LCRS operations and monitoring, 6 as well as monitoring for LDS and other emergency systems (fire, power interruption, and HVAC 7 controls). The administration building will service facility operations, including waste tracking and 8 record keeping systems as well as provide for staff needs including office facilities, lunch room, lockers, 9 and storage. Other functions that may take place in this facility area include equipment maintenance, an 10 equipment and staff decontamination area, and equipment storage. 11 The proposed location of the administration building is shown on Drawing H-2-830827, to the north of 12 the leachate storage and handling area (north of the IDF Phase I development area). This location 13 provides quick access to the leachate control buildings and storage tanks, as well as good interface with 14 existing utilities that will come from existing facilities to the east and west of the IDF. Power and 15 control/communications cables will connect the administration building to the leachate control buildings 16 (crest pad buildings, leachate pump buildings, and leachate storage tanks), as well as to other leachate 17 control structures including the combine manholes and truck loading stations for Cell I and Cell 2. 18 Additional utilities will service the administration building including fire protection, process water, 19 potable water, communications, and power. Calculations for power supply to future facilities are 20 provided in the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF) Detailed Design: Site Utilities Design Report, 21 (RPP-18515, Revision 1). 22 Design criteria and detailed design need to be established for the administration building. The expanded 23 mission of the IDF may influence existing criteria that have already been determined for this facility as 24 provided in conceptual design documents for the original ILAW W-520 Project. Modular units may be 25 considered for this facility. 26 6.9.3 Waste Delivery Access Road 27 The waste delivery from the WTP will access the IDF from 1st Street and enter the IDF along the western 28 perimeter of the landfill. Waste delivery from other areas will access the facility from one of three gates 29 (810, 812, or 815) to the 200 East Area, as discussed previously in Section 1 (refer to Figure 1-3). 30 The Phase I access road is aligned horizontally with the proposed western berm of the complete IDF 31 landfill. The vertical alignment of Phase I access road coordinates with the existing topography of the site 32 between 1st Street and the Phase I landfill area, to minimize cut and fill requirements for this road 33 construction. As such, the Phase I vertical alignment does not follow the vertical alignment of the future 34 western perimeter berm of the landfill and will need to be modified in future expansion phases. 35 All-weather pavement for the Phase I road as well as for 1st Street will need to be completed as part of 36 non-critical design. It is anticipated that pavement will be asphalt concrete pavement. 37 Access for waste haul vehicles will require upgrades to 1st Street to be designed as part of non-critical 38 systems. Design criteria for this upgrade will be based on the anticipated haul vehicles and wheel loads 39 for the various wastes to brought to the facility. From the Phase I Critical Systems design, the melter 40 transport vehicle represents the most restrictive design condition for the road in terms of axle load and 41 radius/grade limitations. However, there are also substantial wheel loads and larger volumes for ILAW 42 package transport vehicles and other MLW and LLW wastes. 43 It should be noted that there will be a significant grade differential between the southern end of the IDF 44 perimeter berm and the existing 1st Street road grade. The western berm climbs at a uniform 1 percent 45 grade to the south. As such, it will have an elevation of approximately 741 feet at the southern perimeter 46 road. The existing grade of 1st Street at the western perimeter of the IDF is approximately 734 feet, and 47 so 1st Street will need to be raised to make this transition and keep vertical road grades at a maximum of 48 5 percent to accommodate the melter transport vehicles. Appendix 4A.1.105

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 6.9.4 Waste Treatment and Staging 2 Currently, no waste treatment facilities have been planned for the IDF. Consideration of waste treatment 3 may be necessary as part of the IDF's expanded mission to take mixed wastes and low-level wastes from 4 both onsite and offsite sources, depending on the waste acceptance criteria that are established for the 5 facility. Waste staging areas are associated with waste receipt and inspection activities, as mentioned 6 previously. Staging and storage areas may also be needed for waste treatment as well. Design of non- 7 critical facilities may need to consider development of these waste treatment and staging areas. 8 During Phase I operation, there is adequate area south of the Phase I landfill area for treatment and 9 staging. Some staging also can occur within the landfill itself that offers the advantage of occurring over 10 lined areas with leachate collection systems in place. However, as wastes are placed and cell lifts become 11 full, staging areas may be limited until new lifts are ready for waste placement. Regulatory requirements 12 for waste staging and storage may also impact location and operational requirements for these areas. 13 6.9.5 Gates and Fences 14 The IDF is being developed within the 200 East area of the Hanford Site, that has controlled access with a 15 perimeter fence and access control gates (refer to Figure 1-1). As such, it is currently not anticipated that 16 additional fencing and gates will be required for access control to the facility. However, operationally it 17 may be determined that a perimeter fence and additional gates may be warranted for isolation of the IDF 18 from adjacent existing facilities and, if so, these need to be designed during implementation of non- 19 critical design components. Site standards for fences and gates would be followed for this design. 20 6.9.6 Site Utilities 21 As mentioned previously, site utilities are included in non-critical systems design. Site utilities will 22 interface with existing utilities that service facilities in the 200 East area. As such, substantial 23 coordination will be required to locate these utilities, determine the best interface tie-in location, and 24 bring these to the IDF site. Key utilities that are needed for the IDF include: 25 * Power to buildings and operating systems, as well as to area lighting 26 * Communication between administration building and operating systems, as well as from the IDF 27 to other area networks 28 * Fire protection water 29 * Process (non-potable) water for operations and facility construction 30 * Potable water 31 Power requirements for leachate control and monitoring systems have been designed during this Phase I 32 Critical Systems design. Access vaults to power and control systems are provided outside of both crest 33 pad buildings (shown on Drawing H-2-830858). It is anticipated that the administration building will 34 connect at these access vaults and will provide power for system operation and an Ethernet connection for 35 controls. Transformer design for bringing power from the site to the administration building (and to 36 leachate control facilities) will be performed during non-critical design, as will design of the Ethernet 37 connection and administration control systems. Calculations for power supply to future facilities are 38 provided in the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF) Detailed Design: Site Utilities Design Report, 39 (RPP-18515, Revision 1). 40 Utility corridors need to be developed to bring these utilities to facility areas. It is recommended that 41 these corridors be developed outside of landfill embankment areas and access roads, to allow for 42 uninterrupted waste placement and facility operation, for future landfill phase development, for protection 43 of liner system anchor trenches, and for protection of utilities from heavy wheel loads. In addition, the 44 future final cover of the IDF is located over the perimeter embankments and catches existing ground at 45 the outside toe of the embankment. Appendix 4A.1.106

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 7.0 OPERATING PROVISIONS 2 7.1 Waste Placement 3 7.1.1 Introduction 4 To establish a baseline for design, construction, and operation of the IDF, a plan for filling the landfill 5 cells was developed. This plan was developed mainly to ensure that landfill configuration and size as 6 proposed for the IDF Phase I Critical Systems were adequate for safe placement of the ILAW, waste from 7 the DBVS, and LLW, both remote handle and contact handle, that will be placed in the Phase I 8 development. The proposed configuration and size of the IDF Phase I landfill are identified in Section 6 9 of this report. 10 The drawings that show the waste placement plan are included in Appendix D. 1. This plan was based on 11 the concept of completely filling the first lift in both cells before beginning filling of the succeeding lift. 12 The plan represents one approach to filling the cells within the proposed configuration. It is possible that 13 other approaches, such as proceeding to a subsequent lift before completely filling the previous lift, also 14 are workable, but development of the plan did not consider alternative methodologies to fill the cells. 15 Development of the plan is also based on conformance with the operational procedures identified for the 16 Base Alternative in Appendix K of the Conceptual Design Report for Immobilized Low-Activity Waste 17 Disposal Facility, Project W-520 (RPP-7908, Revision 0), (CDR). 18 This waste placement plan is intended to meet the applicable functional criteria identified in the System 19 Specification for Immobilized Low-Activity Waste Disposal System (RPP-7303, Revision 3). "As low as 20 reasonably achievable" principals (keeping radiation exposures to as low as reasonably achievable) are 21 embodied in the waste placement plan that was developed. Because of the area available for waste 22 disposal in each cell, the plan provides the capability to relocate filling operations to another area within 23 each cell, if an event occurs that causes operations to halt temporarily, placing waste packages at the 24 current working position. This will allow waste package placement to continue while the situation that 25 caused the operations to cease is resolved. 26 7.1.2 Phase I Configuration 27 Under the proposed configuration for the IDF Phase I, there will be two cells, identical in size. One cell 28 will be for disposal of ILAW and waste from the DBVS; the other cell will be for disposal of LLW. This 29 waste placement plan proposes disposal of ILAW and DBVS waste Cell I and disposal of LLW in Cell 2. 30 Provisions are included for disposal of both remote handle and contact handle waste in each cell. 31 The configuration of the IDF Phase I development as it will exist at the completion of construction, prior 32 to beginning filling operations, is shown in Appendix D, Drawing D.1-1. The initial operations layer, 33 placed as part of Phase I construction, will cover the entire bottom liner and LCRS. The top of the 34 operations layer will be level in the east-west direction and slope down at 1 percent from the south to the 35 north. The operations layer will extend up the west, north, and east side slopes. Access to the facility will 36 be from 1st Street along the western site boundary. An access ramp from the southwest corner of Phase I 37 will lead down the south excavation slope from the west side to the bottom of Phase I and connect to the 38 top of the operations layer near the south east corner of Cell 2. 39 7.1.3 Waste Receipts 40 As stated in Section 6.2, the IDF will receive LAW and Waste from the DBVS. The volumes stated in 41 Section 6.2 are based on waste forecast information provided by FH. The waste volume forecasts are 42 updated by Hanford Site contractors on a regular basis. Actual waste receipt rates at the IDF will likely 43 vary from the estimated amounts. Depending on the receipt rate of LAW and DBVS waste versus the 44 receipt rate of LLW, each lift of Cell 1 and Cell 2 may fill at different rates. The waste placement plan 45 can accommodate differing rates of waste receipt because filling in subsequent lifts in each cell could be 46 begun at different times as soon as the prior lift was complete. The cell that has the higher waste receipt 47 rate will fill faster than the other cell and will determine the time when subsequent phases of development 48 will need to begin so that additional disposal capacity is available when it is needed. Appendix 4A.1.107

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 7.1.4 General Waste Placement Procedures 2 The discussion of waste placement in this plan is based on placement of the uniform height ILAW 3 packages using remote handle. Some adjustments may need to be made for the variable height LLW 4 containers and for contact handle waste, but in general, the waste placement concept will be the same for 5 all types of waste. 6 The configuration of IDF Phase I provides a height sufficient for four layers of ILAW packages, each 7 covered with one meter of operations layer soil to provide shielding to operations personnel during waste 8 package placement. LLW, which will be in variable height containers, can be accommodated within each 9 of these four lifts. However, in some cases the LLW containers may exceed the lift height and, therefore, 10 will not be completely covered by placement of the operations layer soil. In these cases, it may be 11 necessary to mound cover soil around the individual projecting LLW containers to provide sufficient 12 cover for shielding until they are completely covered by subsequent lifts. 13 Each lift will contain multiple ILAW package arrays that span the width of each cell. The packages will 14 be placed in close-packet hexagonal arrays, with placement tolerance averaging 10 centimeters (4 inches) 15 center to center. As the packages are placed in the cell, the array will proceed along the width of the cell. 16 The earth cover will proceed shortly behind the advancing package array, the distance behind the front 17 package limited by the repose slope of the fill soil. The array width (number of columns of packages) 18 will be limited according to the amount of radiation generated by the total number of packages that can be 19 exposed. The CDR indicates that even at some distance from the advancing array, the dose rate becomes 20 a concern when the array approaches more than ten or twelve packages in width. 21 Off-loading of the ILAW packages and other waste containers will take place in the cell. A standard, 22 manually operated, rubber-tired crane will off-load packages, move temporary shielding walls (concrete 23 blocks), and place the interstitial fill between the packages using a hopper. In the CDR, the total weight 24 of the shielding bell, package grapple, load cell, hooks, and other rigging is estimated at 20 metric tons 25 (23 tons). The crane, as identified in the CDR, will be a Grove GMK 5100, a 108 metric ton (120 ton), 26 rough terrain rubber-tired crane with a telescoping boom and a maximum reach of 15 meters (50 feet), 27 with a load of 20 metric tons (23 tons). Pad loads could exceed 55 metric tons (60 tons) when placing an 28 ILAW package at the maximum allowable reach. Dunnage required under each outrigger pad of the 29 crane for lifts of this size has been determined to be 60 square feet, when operating directly on the base 30 operations layer at its point of minimum thickness over the bottom liner system. Dunnage requirements 31 for subsequent lifts would be less, but have not been determined. Refer to Section 5.5.5 and Appendix 32 C.5.e of this Design Report for dunnage requirement calculations. 33 7.1.5 Moveable Shielding Wall 34 With off-loading operations in close proximity to the advancing package array, a moveable shielding wall 35 will be set up between the crane and transporter operations and the placed packages (CDR, Drawing No. 36 ES-W520-BASE). With the 15-meter (50-foot) maximum reach of the crane, the shield walls will have to 37 be moved after every five rows of packages are placed. For a ten-package-wide-array, the wall will need 38 to be relocated after fifty packages have been deposited, or about every eight days during Phase 1. 39 To prevent the crane crew from receiving a high exposure rate, a new shield wall will be erected before 40 the first shield wall is removed. A remote grappling system will be required to prevent rigging of the 41 previously placed shield wall from causing high dose rates to operations personnel. Even then, the 42 amount of time it will take to move the wall is estimated in the CDR to be 26 hours, four to five shifts, or 43 a little less than two days when operating a full 24 hours per day. 44 An alternative to the movable shielding wall is to use contact handle waste to construct the shielding wall 45 and to leave it in place after placement of each ILAW array rather than moving it. This can reduce 46 operations labor and expenses. It can also result in the use of less cover soil because the space between 47 the package arrays will be partly filled with contact handle waste, rather than with all soil. Appendix 4A.1.108

--- Page 194 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I This alternative needs to be considered further when developing the operations plan for operating the 2 disposal facility. 3 7.1.6 Typical Array Size 4 The moveable shielding wall set up between the crane and transporter operations and the placed package 5 configuration will limit the proximity of package placement to between 15 meters (50 feet) and 7.5 meters 6 (25 feet) of the crane. The 7.5 meters (25 feet) usable range of the crane reach, working over the 7 shielding wall, and the ten or twelve maximum package width (because of dose rate limitation) 8 determines the nominal array size that can be placed by the crane from a single set point. The 1.22 meters 9 (4 feet) diameter ILAW packages will be staggered in the array to minimize the space between the 10 packages. A column that is five packages deep can fit within the 7.5 meters (25 feet) available range of 11 the crane reach while working over the shield wall. A width of ten packages is within the reach of the 12 crane and is less than the allowable limits for the dose rate. Allowing for a 10 centimeters (4 inches) 13 average tolerance in package placement, the five-row by ten-package-wide array is roughly 6 meters 14 (20 feet) deep by 13.3 meters (44 feet) wide. A typical array is shown in Appendix D, Drawing D.1-1. 15 7.1.7 Cover Soil 16 Prior to the shield wall being relocated, the crane will place interstitial soil material between the packages, 17 using a hopper. The filling operation is expected to take about one shift, according to the CDR, using up 18 the balance of the two days needed to move the shield wall. To make up the time spent moving the shield 19 wall and placing the interstitial fill soil, the average rate of package placement will have to be increased to 20 seven packages per day for five days, according to the CDR. 21 While the shield wall is being relocated, a soil cover will be placed over the packages from on top of the 22 lift of previously placed packages. Dump trucks will drive over the previously covered portion of the 23 array and back up to near the edge of the packages that are still exposed and dump a load of fill soil for 24 spreading by a bulldozer. The soil will be spread over the top of the top and exposed side of the array. 25 The side slope from soil, cascading off the top, will be formed in no less than 1.5 H: 1V for reasons of 26 safety, and will use approximately a 5-meter (16-foot) wide space between lines of arrays. 27 Approximately 300 cubic meters (400 cubic yards) of soil will be required to cover the top and side of the 28 five-row-deep by ten-package-wide array. The cover soil will be held back from the advancing end of the 29 array so that the toe of the cover soil does not extend beyond the outer package in the array. This will 30 allow the next array to be placed in close proximity to the previous array. After the bulldozer spreads the 31 soil to a somewhat uniform 1-meter-plus thickness over the packages, a sheepsfoot-style compactor will 32 make several passes to consolidate the fill soil. The cover soil effort will take approximately 12 hours or 33 two shifts, as estimated in the CDR, and will take place at the same time that the portable shield wall is 34 being relocated. 35 7.1.8 Failed Melter Disposal Area 36 (Note: Disposal of failed melters is not permitted at this time by this permit.) 37 38 Failed melters can be disposed of as MLLW in Cell 1. A failed melter disposal area is provided on the 39 bottom of Cell I at the southern toe of the waste lifts. Disposing of the failed melters in this area would 40 eliminate placing them within the lifts along with the ILAW packages and other MLLW. 41 7.1.9 Access Ramps 42 Two 30-foot wide access ramps will be built into the south slope of the waste lifts to accommodate the 43 movement of transport vehicles and equipment from one lift to the next. A third access ramp will be built 44 through the north shine berm onto the top of the third lift to accommodate transport vehicles and 45 equipment during the construction of Phase II, when the access ramp leading down the south excavation 46 slope to the bottom of Phase I will be removed. 47 Appendix 4A.1.109

--- Page 195 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The access ramp into Cell I and the access ramp from the north side would have a maximum slope of 5 2 percent to accommodate failed melter transporters, if it becomes necessary to dispose of the melters in the 3 waste lifts rather than in the designated area at the bottom of Cell 1. The access ramp into Cell 2 would 4 have a maximum slope of 8 percent that would accommodate the ILAW, DBVS containers, and LLW 5 waste transporters. The access ramps at the bottom of Phase I would have minimum outside turning radii 6 of 75 feet, to accommodate the failed melter transporters. The dimensions of the access ramps provide 7 flexibility to accommodate the various waste haul vehicles that could use the ramps. 8 7.1.10 Filling Lift 1 9 Filling of remote handle ILAW and DBVS waste in Cell I will begin in the northwest corner and proceed 10 to the southeast. Filling of remote handle LLW in Cell 2 will begin in the northeast corner and proceed to 11 the southwest. Filling of contact handle LLW will begin in the northwest corner of cell 2 and proceed 12 southeast (see Appendix D, Drawing D.1-2). This filling approach places the remote handle wastes 13 farthest apart from each other, with contact handle wastes between them, and eliminates the need for 14 additional shielding provisions that would be necessary if the two remote handles wastes were located 15 adjacent to each other. This filling approach will be continued in the three subsequent lifts. 16 Nearly all of Lift I can be filled with the crane and transporters, operating from the top of the first 17 operations layer. A 5-meter (17-foot) wide separation will be maintained between Cell 1 and Cell 2 to 18 separate the ILAW and DBVS waste from the LLW. This separation area will be filled with soil. Using a 19 low permeability soil in this area will maximize separation of leachate between the two cells. Two access 20 lanes (ramps) will be maintained into the cells for transporter access. The transporters can turn around 21 within the cells until the packages are within 7.5 meters (25 feet) of the area needed for the unloading 22 operations. 23 Before the space for filling Lift I from the top of the first operations layer is consumed, the two access 24 ramps will be extended with soil and contact handle waste to the top of Lift 1. The crane and transporters 25 will go to the top of Lift I and will finish placing the remainder of the Lift I waste packages from the top 26 (see Appendix D, Drawing D.1-3). At this point, it will also be possible to begin using the failed melter 27 disposal area (also shown on Drawing D. 1-3). 28 7.1.11 Filling Lift 2 29 Lift 2 will be filled similarly to Lift I (see Appendix D, Drawing D.1-4). This filling approach will 30 continue the pattern that was established in Lift 1. Nearly the entire lift can be filled with the crane and 31 transporters operating on the top of Lift 1. The 5-meter (17-foot) wide soil-filled separation will be 32 maintained between Cell I and Cell 2 to separate the ILAW and DBVS waste from the LLW. The two 33 access ramps will be maintained into both cells for transporter access. The transporters can turn around 34 within the cells until the packages are within 7.5 meters (25 feet) of the area needed for the unloading 35 operations. Before the space for filling Lift 2 from the top of Lift 1 is consumed, the two access ramps 36 will be extended with soil and contact handle waste to the top of Lift 2. The crane and transporters will 37 go to the top of Lift 2 and will finish placing the remainder of the Lift 2 waste packages from the top (see 38 Appendix D, Drawing D.1-5). 39 7.1.12 Filling Lift 3 40 Lift 3 will be filled similarly to Lift 2 (see Appendix D, Drawing D.1-6). Nearly the entire lift can be 41 filled with the crane and transporters operating on the top of Lift 2. The 5-meter (17-foot) wide soil-filled 42 separation will be maintained between Cell I and Cell 2 to separate the ILAW and DBVS waste from the 43 LLW. Two access ramps will be extended into the cells for transporter access. The transporters can turn 44 around within the cells until the packages are within 7.5 meters (25 feet) of the area needed for the 45 unloading operations. Before the space for filling Lift 3 from the top of Lift 2 is consumed, the two 46 access ramps will be extended with soil and contact handle waste to the top of Lift 3. The crane and 47 transporters will go to the top of Lift 3 and will finish placing the remainder of the Lift 3 waste packages 48 from the top (see Appendix D, Drawing D. 1-7). Appendix 4A.1.110

--- Page 196 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 7.1.13 Filling Lift 4 2 Lift 4 will be filled similarly to the previous three lifts, but with a few differences (see Appendix D, 3 Drawing D.1-8). Most of the lift can be filled with the crane and transporters operating on the top of Lift 4 3, using the access ramps from the south. However, only the easterly access ramp from the south is 5 planned to be extended to the top of Lift 4 for transporter access. The westerly access ramp from the 6 south will not be extended because, as shown on Appendix D, Drawing D. 1-9, it would reach the top of 7 Lift 4 too close to the west side slope to accommodate an adequate turning radius for the transport 8 vehicles. The access ramp will be blocked by waste placement in Cell 1. However, with some minor 9 adjustment in its location and/or increase in its slope, it will be possible to extend the access ramp into 10 Cell 1, if desired. Also, at some point during the filling Lift 4, construction for Phase II to the south will 11 begin, and the access road from the south will be removed from service. 12 Prior to the westerly access ramp becoming blocked with waste and the access road from the south 13 removed for construction of Phase II, a third access ramp will be constructed from the north down onto 14 the top of Lift 3 to provide additional access. This access ramp will maintain separation between Cell 1 15 and Cell 2, to separate the ILAW and DBVS waste from the LLW. The transporters can turn around 16 within the cells until the packages are within 7.5 meters (25 feet) of the area needed for the unloading 17 operations. 18 Before the space for filling Lift 4 from the top of Lift 3 is consumed, the easterly access ramp will be 19 extended with soil and contact handle waste to the top of Lift 4, and the access ramp from the north will 20 be graded out onto the top of Lift 4. The crane and transporters will go to the top of Lift 4 and will finish 21 placing the remainder of the Lift 4 waste packages from the top (see Appendix D, Drawing D.1-9). 22 Completion of Lift 4 will end the filling operations in Phase I. The configuration at the end of Lift 4, 23 prior to placement of the final cover system, is shown on Appendix D, Drawing D.1-10. 24 7.1.14 Transitioning Between Lifts 25 As the available operating space in a lift gets smaller, operations efficiency will decrease to a point where 26 it will become necessary to move part of the operations to the next lift before the active lift is completed. 27 This will allow completion of each lift, using selected waste that will be easier to handle in the remaining 28 space available on the lift. An example of this would be to use only contact handle waste to complete the 29 filling of each lift while operating on the top of the lift that is being completed (see Appendix D, 30 Drawings D.1-3, -5, -7, and -9) and sending all remote handle waste into the next lift. 31 7.1.15 Planning for Phase II and Operations During Phase II Construction 32 Phase II will need to be constructed and ready for operations sufficiently ahead of completion of filling 33 operations in Lift 4 of Phase I to allow a smooth transition without operational constraints. Planning, 34 design, and construction of Phase II may require several years. Phase II should be planned to be ready for 35 operation at least six months, and preferably one year or more, before Lift 4 in Phase I is anticipated to be 36 completed. This will provide a reasonable margin for changes in the incoming waste quantities and other 37 variables while still having Phase II ready for operation, prior to reaching capacity in Phase I. 38 While Phase II is under construction, the access road on the west will be out of service for a period of 39 time and the access ramp on the south into Phase I will be removed. During this time, it will be necessary 40 for all waste transport vehicles to enter Phase I, using the access ramp on the north side. As currently 41 designed, some access roads on the west and north sides of Phase I that normally would be used to reach 42 the north access ramp might not accommodate all of the transport vehicles. In particular, the berm access 43 road on the west side of Phase I and the access roads around the leachate storage tanks on the north do not 44 have widths and turning radii as large as required by the waste transport vehicles. These roads would 45 have to be widened and their turning radii increased to meet the requirements for transport vehicles, 46 particularly the failed melter transporters. Appendix 4A. 1.111

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 7.2 Operational Interfaces 2 Operations and maintenance procedures will be prepared in the future as a separate project. These 3 procedures will address operations, monitoring, and maintenance activities for the IDF. 4 This section of the Design Report presents important operational interfaces that have been identified by 5 the design team. These interfaces should be considered during preparation of the operation and 6 maintenance procedures. The interfaces are grouped by three categories-landfill excavation, liner system, 7 and leachate handling system. 8 7.2.1 IDF Landfill Excavation and Related Subsystems 9 Operational interfaces for the landfill excavation and related subsystems include the following: 10 * Due to the containerized nature of the waste, the landfill is designed to be filled in a bottom-up 11 fashion in four or more layers. The number of layers will depend on waste package size. Some 12 waste packages may be larger in dimension than the ILAW packages. Operational procedures 13 should be developed to accommodate various package sizes and their placement. 14 * Clean fill placement between waste packages must be done to minimize the potential for future 15 consolidation and potential subsidence. 16 * Operations layer on side slopes of IDF will be monitored for material loss due to wind and water 17 erosion. Lost material should be replaced. Annual application of spray-on type soil stabilization 18 material to exposed areas of Phase I IDF should be considered. 19 * Shine berms should be monitored for erosion and height and should be repaired as necessary. 20 Erosion control matting on the berm will be maintained and repaired or replaced if damage 21 occurs. 22 * Stormwater control facilities should be maintained annually. Maintenance would include debris 23 removal from the ditches and application of weed control. Periodically, if capacity of infiltration 24 areas is diminished due to collection of fines, fines removal will be necessary. To maintain 25 infiltration capacity, no other vehicle access should be allowed into these areas. 26 * Stormwater accumulation in the in-cell excavation infiltration area should be visually monitored. 27 Pumping of the area may be necessary if accumulation becomes significant (near liner levels) in 28 wet weather seasons. Periodically, if capacity of infiltration areas is diminished due to collection 29 of fines, fines removal will be necessary. To maintain infiltration capacity, no other vehicle 30 access should be allowed into these areas. 31 * Due to the heavy wheel loads on the access roads and ramps, gravel surfacing will be maintained 32 with regular maintenance. Maintenance activities may include addition of more top course 33 material, and grading and compaction of this material. 34 * Active faces of stockpiles will require periodic application of spray-on soil stabilization material. 35 7.2.2 IDF Liner System 36 Operational interfaces for the lining system include the following: 37 * Only equipment with ground pressures less than 4,400 lb/ft should be used for construction and 38 maintenance on the side slopes, when operating directly on the operations layer. Bulldozers or 39 other equipment may operate on the side slopes until a rain event in excess of 0.15 inches per 40 hour occurs. In that event, equipment should be kept off the side slope (directly on the operations 41 layer) and should not be permitted to operate on slopes until two hours after the end of the rainfall 42 event. The precipitation event applies to both the lined slopes and the unlined slopes at the 43 southern end of the Phase I cell. 44 * For equipment on ramps, equipment should be kept a minimum of 2 feet away from the edge of 45 ramps, to avoid localized sloughing of the ramp edges. Appendix 4A.1.112

--- Page 198 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * When operating equipment or placing waste on the operations layer above the lining system, care 2 should be taken to avoid damaging the liner. Special care will be necessary for equipment 3 operation on the side slopes. 4 * Any loads placed on the surface of the first operations layer must be examined to verify that they 5 do not create loads on the lining system in excess of the allowable GCL bearing capacity. As an 6 example, different types of waste other than canisters should be examined as the waste plan is 7 more fully developed. Care should also be taken to avoid impact loading, such as dropping a 8 canister. 9 * For static loading (such as for a barrier wall), refer to the discussion in Section 5.2 and 10 Appendix C.2. 11 * For operational/equipment loading, refer to the discussion in Section 5.5.5 and Appendix C.5.e to 12 determine applicable load limits and crane dunnage requirements. 13 The waste plan, as it is developed, should be followed for placement and density requirements. Any 14 revisions to the proposed waste filling plan (discussed in Section 7.1) should be reviewed by the design 15 engineer, to evaluate impacts on the waste/fill global stability analyses (Section 5.1.3 and 16 Appendix C. 1.c). 17 As part of the waste/fill global stability analyses, the waste mass was considered internally stable for this 18 design effort. Internal waste mass stability is a function of the waste filling approach. There are 19 numerous options available to stabilize the waste through operational methodologies, such as providing a 20 greater soil buttress on the open 3:1 south slope. During subsequent design phases, the internal stability 21 of the waste should be evaluated in conjunction with the waste filling plan. 22 7.2.3 IDF Leachate Handling System 23 Operational interfaces for the leachate handling system include the following: 24 * Coordinate with Liquid Effluent Retention Facility (LERF) for leachate hauling and removal of 25 leachate from tanks to satisfy the 90-day accumulation period (Treatment capacities at LERF and 26 leachate flows for critical periods should also be coordinated. See Section 5.9.2.4 for additional 27 leachate hauling constraints.) 28 * Use leak detection history for leachate storage tanks, during the operation of IDF, to manage and 29 plan for replacement of tank liner system and temporary storage required during its replacement. 30 * Periodic preventative inspection and maintenance for all rotating equipment should be scheduled. 31 * For leachate tanks floating covers, rain or snow will need to be pumped off with the 32 manufacturer-included sump pump (mounted on side of tank). Water should not be allowed to 33 accumulate except at the perimeter of the floating cover. Excessive water may prevent vent 34 operation and cause mixing between precipitation water and leachate on top of the cover. 35 * An adequate store of critical spare electrical and mechanical parts should be maintained. 36 * All valves should be exercised at least annually. 37 * A small "contractor-type" trash pump with hose should be kept on hand that can be used to pump 38 from the leak detection chamber within the combined sump to its inner sump. 39 * Periodically, test operation of the combined sump pump should be done. 40 * Annual testing of all leachate pumps for proper operation should be scheduled. 41 * Regular verification of level transducer calibration in cells should be done. 42 * Prior to winter months, proper operation of all heat tracing system should be checked. 43 * Periodic testing of all control relays, switches and contacts should be scheduled. 44 * Additional operational interface items will be developed, based on completion of design of the 45 control system for the leachate handling system. This will be part of the IDF administration 46 building design. Appendix 4A.1.113

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility * Maintenance should be provided in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. 2 7.3 Leakage Response Action Plan 3 WAC 173-303-665(9) regulations require the owner of the operator of a landfill unit to have an approved 4 Response Action Plan (RAP) before receipt of waste. The RAP is a site-specific plan that establishes 5 actions to be taken if leakage through the upper (primary) lining system of a landfill exceeds a certain 6 rate. The intent of the RAP is to assure that any leachate that leaks through the primary lining system will 7 not migrate out of the landfill into the environment. 8 A key element of the RAP is the ALR, a threshold value which triggers the responses described in the 9 RAP, but below which no special actions are required. Because landfill liner systems have not yet been 10 perfected, a small amount of leakage through the primary liner generally occurs, despite the use of best 11 available materials, construction techniques, and QA procedures. (This leakage is collected by the LDS 12 system and removed from the landfill.) Hence, the ALR is set at some level higher than normally 13 expected leakage rates to serve as an indicator that the primary lining system is not functioning as 14 expected. Exceeding the ALR may reflect serious failure of the primary lining system and indicates the 15 need for investigation and possibly corrective action while the problem is still manageable. 16 This RAP has been prepared in accordance with requirements of WAC 173-303-665(9). The 17 requirements for determining the ALR are contained in WAC 173-303-665(8) and EPA guidance 18 document, Action Leakage Rates for Leak Detection Systems (EPA 1992a). 19 The following sections establish the ALR and discuss response actions to be taken if the ALR is 20 exceeded. 21 7.3.1 Action Leakage Rate 22 Section 5.11 provides a detailed discussion of the analysis to determine the ALR into the LDS for the 23 IDF. Based on this analyses, the ALR for each IDF cell is 206 gallons per acre per day, or approximately 24 1,800 gallons per day per cell (each cell area is approximately 8.5 acres). This value includes a factor of 25 safety of 2 in accordance with EPA guidelines (EPA 1992b). It is also much lower than the LDS pump 26 capacity. Details of the calculation are presented in Appendix C. 10. 27 In accordance with WAC 173-303-665(8)(b), the flow rate used to determine if the ALR has been 28 exceeded will be calculated as the average daily flow rate into the sump, expressed as gallons per acre per 29 day (unless Ecology approves a different calculation). This calculation will be performed on a weekly 30 basis during the active (operational) life of the landfill, and monthly after the landfill has been closed. 31 Post-closure frequency may be reduced if only minimal amounts of leachate accumulate in the LDS 32 sump. As outlined in WAC 173-303-665(4)(c)(ii), during post-closure monitoring, if the liquid level in 33 the LDS sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive months, monitoring of the 34 amount of liquid in the LDS sumps can be reduced to at least quarterly. If the liquid level in the LDS 35 sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive quarters, monitoring of the amount of 36 liquid in the LDS sumps can be reduced to at least semiannually. Pump operating level is defined as a 37 liquid level approved by Ecology, based on pump activation level, sump dimensions, and level that 38 minimizes head in the sump. 39 7.3.2 Response Actions 40 WAC 173-303-665(9) lists several required actions if the ALR is exceeded. In the event that the ALR is 41 exceeded, DOE will: 42 * Notify Ecology in writing of the exceedance within 7 days of the determination. 43 * Submit a preliminary written assessment to Ecology within 14 days of the determination, as to the 44 amount of liquids, likely sources of liquids, possible location, size, cause of any leaks, and short- 45 term actions taken and planned. 46 * Determine, to the extent practicable, the location, size , and cause of any leak. Appendix 4A.1. 114

--- Page 200 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Determine whether waste receipt should cease or be curtailed, whether any waste should be 2 removed from the unit for inspection, repairs, or controls, and whether or not the unit should be 3 closed. 4 * Determine any other short-term and longer-term actions to be taken to mitigate or stop any leaks. 5 Within 30 days after the notification that the ALR has been exceeded, submit to Ecology the results of the 6 analyses specified in bullets 3, 4, and 5 of this section, the results of actions taken, and actions planned. 7 Monthly thereafter, as long as the flow rate in the LDS exceeds the ALR, the owner or operator must 8 submit to the regional administrator a report summarizing the results of any remedial actions taken and 9 actions planned. 10 If the ALR is exceeded, the DOE will submit the required notifications to Ecology, as stated above. The 11 EPA will also receive copies of this confirmation. 12 The leachate will be analyzed for chemical compounds and radionuclides. If the analytical results 13 indicate that these constituents are present, and if the constituents can be traced to a particular type of 14 waste stored in a known area of the landfill, then it may be possible to estimate the location of the leak. 15 However, because the waste will meet land disposal restrictions, it will contain no free liquids and will be 16 stabilized or solidified. In addition, the canister(s) or other type of waste package(s) may not undergo 17 enough deterioration during the active life of the landfill to permit escape of its contents. For these 18 reasons, it is possible that the leachate may be clean or the composition too general to indicate a specific 19 source location. 20 If the source location cannot be identified, large-scale removal of the waste and operations layer to find 21 and repair the leaking area of the liner would be one option for remediation. However, this procedure 22 risks damaging the liner. In addition, waste would have to be handled, stored, and replaced in the landfill. 23 Backfill would need to be removed from around the waste packages to accomplish this. If the waste 24 packages are damaged during this process, the risk of accidental release may be high. For these reasons, 25 large scale removal of waste and liner system materials is not considered a desirable option and will not 26 be implemented except as a last resort. 27 The preferred options for remediation include covers and changes in landfill operating procedures. The 28 preferred alternative will depend on factors such as the amount of waste already in the landfill, the rate of 29 waste receipt, the chemistry of the leachate, the availability of other RCRA-compliant disposal facilities, 30 and similar considerations. Hence, at this time no single approach can be selected. If the ALR is 31 exceeded, potential options will be evaluated prior to selecting a remediation process. If necessary, an 32 interim solution will be implemented while the evaluation and permanent remediation is performed. 33 Examples of potential approaches include the following: 34 * The surface of the intermediate soil cover over the waste could be graded to direct runoff into a 35 shallow pond. The surface would then be covered with a discardable, temporary geomembrane 36 (e.g., 30-mil PVC or reinforced polypropylene). Precipitation water would be pumped or 37 evaporated from the pond and would not infiltrate the waste already in the landfill. Waste 38 packages would be placed only during periods of dry weather and stored temporarily at other 39 times. This type of approach would also be used, if necessary, to reduce leakage during the time 40 immediately after the ALR was exceeded, while other remediation options were being evaluated. 41 * If the landfill was nearly full, partial construction of the final closure cover might be an option. 42 This would reduce infiltration into the landfill and possibly the leakage rate, if the cover were 43 constructed over the failed area. 44 * A layer of low-permeability soil could be placed over the existing waste, perhaps in conjunction 45 with a geomembrane, to create a second "primary" liner higher in the landfill. This new liner 46 would intercept precipitation and allow its removal. Appendix 4A.1.115

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility * A rigid-frame or air-supported structure could be constructed over the landfill to ensure that no 2 infiltration occurred. Although costly, this approach might be less expensive than constructing a 3 new landfill. 4 In general, the selected remediation efforts would be those that are easiest to implement, with more 5 difficult or expensive options to be applied only if earlier approaches were not satisfactory. 6 8.0 REFERENCES 7 40 CFR 264.

--- Page 274 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Nuclear density meter test methods will be used for the field-testing of the in situ dry unit weight of the 2 in-place, compacted fill. Any settlement or other defects in the fill will be backfilled and compacted in 3 accordance with the technical specifications. 4 Standard count calibrations will be conducted to monitor the aging of the nuclear density gauge sources in 5 accordance with ASTM standards. Sand cone or drive sleeve tests will be conducted periodically to 6 verify densities using the nuclear density gauge. Oven moisture content tests will be conducted and 7 compared to field moisture content results to determine a field correction factor for moisture. Sand cone 8 or drive sleeve tests and in situ moisture content tests will be performed at the frequencies specified in 9 Tables 2-1 and 2-2. 10 If an in-place density test result fails to meet specifications, a confirmatory test will be performed 11 immediately adjacent to the failed test. If the confirmatory test meets or exceeds specifications, a second 12 confirmatory test will be performed at a second location immediately next to the failed test. If the second 13 confirmatory test also meets or exceeds specifications, the area will be declared as meeting project 14 specifications and the confirmatory tests will be reported. In the event that either confirmatory test fails 15 to meet specifications, a CQA representative will determine the extent and nature of the defect by 16 observations and/or additional testing, as necessary, to identify the limits of the area that does not meet 17 project specifications. 18 If a defective area is discovered in the fill, a CQA representative will determine the extent and nature of 19 the defect. If the defect is indicated by an unsatisfactory test result, the CQA representative will 20 determine the extent of the defective area by additional tests, observations, a review of records, or other 21 means that the CQA representative deems appropriate. If the defect is related to adverse site conditions, 22 such as excessively wet soils or surface desiccation, the CQA representative will define the limits and 23 nature of the defect by testing or observation. After the extent and nature of a defect is determined and 24 remedied by the construction general contractor, the CQA representative will verify that the deficiency 25 has been corrected by re-testing repaired areas before any additional work is performed by the 26 construction general contractor in the area of the deficiency. All confirmatory tests, failing tests, and re- 27 tests will be recorded in the CQA representative's field book or compaction testing form. The 28 approximate location and elevation of each test will be recorded. 29 The CQA representative will document fill placement and compaction as determined by the test methods 30 and frequency prescribed by this CQA Plan and will report any non-conformance in accordance with the 31 non-conformance reporting procedures outlined in Section 8.1.4. 32 2.2 Prepared Subgrade 33 The CQA representative will verify and document that the prepared subgrade is constructed to the 34 elevations and grades shown in the construction drawings, with subgrade meeting the requirements of the 35 technical specifications as determined by the test methods and frequencies specified within this CQA 36 Plan. 37 Upon completion of the excavation of the landfill, the CQA monitor will perform the following tasks: 38 * Inspect the subgrade on the side slopes and base of the landfill and note areas of weak or 39 excessively weathered subgrade materials. 40 * Observe completion of excavation and subgrade compaction prior to foundation, fill, or liner 41 placement. 42 * Observe the proof rolling of the base of the landfill and note areas that exhibit excessive rutting, 43 heaving, or softening. 44 * Observe that the surface of the subgrade is free of debris, wet and soft areas, standing water, 45 vegetation, mud, ice, or frozen material. 46 * Observe any excavation and backfilling operations associated with unsuitable material found in 47 the prepared subgrade. Appendix 4B.23

--- Page 275 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Verify that a survey has been conducted to further verify that the subgrade grades and elevations 2 conform to the construction drawings. 3 * Verify that the prepared subgrade material meets the requirements of the technical specifications 4 as determined by the CQA testing methods and frequency in Table 2-3. 5 * Verify that sampling points in the prepared subgrade are plugged or backfilled so that the 6 prepared subgrade meets the technical specifications. 7 * Document the location and volume of any unsuitable material removed from the prepared 8 subgrade and report any non-conformance with the technical specifications in accordance with 9 the non-conformance reporting procedures in Section 8.1.4 10 2.2.1 Layer Completion Certification 11 The construction general contractor will be required to notify the CQA representative when an area of 12 prepared subgrade is complete prior to constructing the overlying layer. The construction general 13 contractor can proceed with the overlying layer upon acceptance of the area of prepared subgrade by the 14 CQA representative. The CQA certifying engineer will provide a certificate of layer completion to the 15 construction general contractor and the IDF project engineer, certifying that the area is complete. 16 2.3 Soil Bentonite Admix Liner and Test Pads 17 The soil bentonite admix liner (SBL) is composed of a mixture of base soil and bentonite material. Two 18 SBL test pads will include both a horizontal and a sloped test pad. The horizontal test pad will be 19 constructed by using the same compaction methods as that used for the production SBL, to ensure the 20 SBL is constructed to meet the minimum hydraulic conductivity requirements. The sloped test pad will 21 be constructed on a sloping surface to verify that compaction methods (determined during the horizontal 22 test pad) will be adequate for the side slopes of the landfill. If necessary, the technical specifications 23 and/or CQA Plan may be modified, based on the results of the test pads. 24 2.3.1 Test Pads 25 Test pads will be constructed by the construction general contractor to determine acceptable placement 26 and compaction methods to produce a low permeable SBL on a horizontal surface and on a 3H:IV side 27 slope that satisfies the performance requirements of the technical specifications. 28 In addition, the mixing of the base soil and bentonite admixture using the pugmill will be tested to ensure 29 adequate control of the ratio of admixture components as well as the homogeneity of the completed SBL 30 mixture. 31 2.3.1.1 Construction Quality Assurance Evaluation 32 During test pad construction, the CQA representative will continuously observe and document the 33 construction of the test pad. These guidelines will be followed to ensure that the test pad accurately 34 represents the performance of the full-scale facility: 35 * Construction of the test pad will use the same soil material, design specifications, equipment, and 36 procedures as proposed for the full-scale facility. 37 * The test pad length, width, and depth will be as required by the technical specifications and for 38 the in-situ hydraulic conductivity test spacing. 39 * The number of lifts used to construct the test pad will be as required by the technical 40 specifications. 41 The test pad will be constructed to allow determination of the relationship among density, moisture 42 content, and method of compaction. Field variables can affect this relationship and must be carefully 43 measured and controlled, both in the test pad and during construction of the full-scale liner. At a 44 minimum, the following will be observed and documented: Appendix 4B.24

--- Page 276 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Track weight of base soil and bentonite during mixing operations. 2 * Mixing operation homogeneity. 3 * Test pad configuration and dimensions. 4 * Compaction equipment type, configuration, and weight. 5 * Number of passes and speed of the compaction equipment. 6 * Uncompacted and compacted lift thickness. 7 * Weather conditions, including ambient temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and 8 precipitation. 9 The CQA representative will provide the necessary surveying and/or reference grid points, for adequately 10 and expeditiously, determining the elevation and dimensions of the test pad, including each lift. 11 The CQA representative will be responsible for all testing, surveying, and documentation necessary to 12 verify that the test pad performs in accordance with the technical specifications, and that the methods, 13 equipment, and materials used can achieve the same results or better during full-scale construction. 14 Testing methods and frequencies will be as indicated in Table 2-4. Additional tests may be conducted at 15 the direction of the CQA certifying engineer. All tests will be conducted in accordance with the methods 16 and procedures specified in Table 2-4. Tests are separately identified in Table 2-4 which are intended to 17 provide the following: 18 * Information Only, for use in evaluating overall methods, materials, or equipment. 19 * Pass/Fail, which have criteria established in the technical specifications which must be met. 20 * Calibration and Check, for use in calibrating instruments. 21 The CQA certifying engineer will compare the results of the test pad constructed on the level surface with 22 the results of the test pad on the side slopes. The CQA certifying engineer will recommend changes to 23 compaction methods, if necessary, to the IDF project engineer. The CQA certifying engineer will prepare 24 an interim report, which summarizes the construction and testing of the test pads. 25 It is important to note that an acceptable zone has been established in the technical specifications for the 26 allowable moisture content and density ranges that are applicable for the SBL admix to meet minimum 27 permeability requirements. This zone may be adjusted as a result of the test pad data obtained during 28 construction to reflect specific conditions observed based on the construction general contractor's 29 proposed blending, placement, and compaction methods. With the range of placement moisture content 30 and density allowed with this approach, minimum compaction effort (i.e., the number of passes a piece of 31 compaction equipment needs to bring the admix into the allowable moisture/density zone) will vary based 32 on material conditions and placement location. Minimum compaction effort recommendations will be 33 developed by the CQA certifying engineer for application to both bottom slope and side-slope admix 34 construction based on test pad results. However, these minimums should be considered as guidelines 35 only and may need to be adjusted based on changes to admix properties (primarily moisture content), site 36 conditions, and compaction location as needed to bring the admix into the required acceptable zone for 37 compaction. 38 2.3.2 Soil Bentonite Admix Liner 39 The CQA team will verify and document that the SBL is placed to the elevations, grades, and thicknesses 40 shown in the construction drawings, with bentonite-amended material meeting the requirements of the 41 technical specifications as determined by the test methods and frequencies specified within this CQA 42 Plan. 43 2.3.2.1 Construction Quality Assurance Evaluation 44 CQA testing will be performed during processing and placement of the SBL. The CQA team will 45 conduct the processing and placement tests for the SBL as specified in Table 2-5. The maximum 46 allowable percentage of failing tests is specified in Table 2-6. Appendix 4B.25

Deleterious base soil or base soil not meeting the technical specifications will be 31 identified and reported to the CQA certifying engineer and not allowed in the processing area. 32 CQA tests will be performed on the raw bentonite used in the SBL to verify conformance to the technical 33 specifications. The CQA representative will collect samples of raw bentonite delivered to the site for 34 testing. The CQA laboratory technician will conduct free swell, and grain size tests of the bentonite in 35 accordance with Table 2-5. If the test results of a sample fail to meet specifications, a confirmatory test 36 will be performed immediately subsequent to the failed test. If the confirmatory test meets or exceeds 37 specifications, a second confirmatory test will be performed. If the second confirmatory test also meets or 38 exceeds specifications, the bentonite will be declared as meeting project specifications and the 39 confirmatory tests will be reported. In the event that either confirmatory test fails to meet specifications, 40 the bentonite will be rejected and removed from the site. 41 The CQA representative will observe mixing and test the bentonite-amended soil, prior to placing it in the 42 landfill. 43 Placement 44 Prior to the placement of the SBL, the CQA representative will verify and document the following: Appendix 4B.26

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * The test pads have been constructed with the approved liner material and production scale 2 equipment to confirm placement and compaction procedures produce the required low- 3 permeability admix for both on a horizontal surface and on a 3H: IV side slope. 4 * All or an approved portion of the prepared subgrade meets specifications as determined by the 5 test requirements of this CQA Plan and the CQA certifying engineer has issued the completion 6 certificate. 7 * The SBL material is free of roots, stumps, vegetation, or any other type of deleterious material 8 that may impact the performance of the placed SBL. 9 * The SBL material does not contain stones with dimensions in excess of those required by the 10 technical specifications. 11 * The SBL material meets or exceeds the requirements of the technical specifications as determined 12 by the CQA testing methods and frequency in Table 2-5. 13 * The moisture content of the SBL material is uniform. 14 During placement and compaction of the SBL, the CQA Team will verify and document the following: 15 * Close observation of the placement and compaction of SBL material with earthmoving equipment 16 is performed by the field inspectors. Inspectors to verify that means and methods are the same as 17 those approved in the test pad process. 18 * The SBL material meets the requirements of the technical specifications as determined by the 19 CQA testing methods and frequency in Table 2-5 and is within the maximum allowable failure 20 rates in Table 2-6. 21 * The SBL is placed in accordance with the conditions and minimum requirements of the technical 22 specifications. 23 * Each lift is compacted to the required thickness and minimum dry unit weight within the range of 24 moisture contents established by the technical specifications as determined by the CQA testing 25 methods and frequency in Table 2-5. 26 * Shelby tube samples are collected for laboratory permeability testing at the frequency specified in 27 Table 2-5. 28 * Penetrations in the SBL at testing and sampling locations are repaired in accordance with the 29 technical specifications. 30 * The SBL is maintained until it is covered by the geomembrane liner in accordance with the 31 technical specifications. 32 * In areas of inaccessibility by the compactor, in areas of nonstandard SBL placement, and/or in 33 areas of different compaction methods, more frequent testing will be performed due to thinner lift 34 thicknesses to achieve equivalent compactive effort. Each lift, no matter how thin, will be tested 35 for density and moisture in accordance with Table 2-5. 36 The CQA representative will document the properties of the SBL as determined by the test methods and 37 frequency prescribed by this CQA Plan and will report any non-conformance in accordance with the 38 non-conformance reporting, as outlined in Section 8.1.4. 39 The CQA representatives will collect samples immediately after a loose lift of SBL materials has been 40 placed for property tests, prior to compaction. Once compacted, nuclear density gauge test methods will 41 be used for testing the in situ compacted dry unit weight and moisture content of the SBL. Standard 42 count calibration and moisture content tests will be used to calibrate the reading of the nuclear density 43 gauge. Standard count calibration and in situ moisture content tests, using the oven dry method, will be 44 performed at the frequencies specified in Table 2-5. The results of the oven dry moisture content tests 45 will be compared with the field moisture content results to determine a field moisture correction factor. Appendix 4B.27

--- Page 279 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The CQA representative will adjust the field moisture correction factor as test data is collected (i.e., 2 moving average). The CQA representative will collect Shelby tube samples of the SBL for laboratory 3 permeability tests as specified in Table 2-5. 4 If in-place density test results fail to meet specifications, a confirmatory test will be performed 5 immediately adjacent to (within 3 ft of) the failed test. If the confirmatory test meets or exceeds 6 specifications, a second confirmatory test will be performed at a second location immediately next to 7 (within 3 ft of) the failed test. If the second confirmatory test also meets or exceeds specifications, the 8 area will be declared as meeting project specifications and the confirmatory tests will be reported. In the 9 event that either confirmatory test fails to meet specifications, additional testing will be performed to 10 identify the limits of the area that does not meet project specifications. All confirmatory tests, failing 11 tests, and re-tests will be recorded in the CQA representative's field book or compaction testing form. 12 The approximate location and elevation of each test will be recorded. 13 Rapid laboratory permeability tests, such as the constant volume tests, will be used when possible to 14 determine permeability. Once the sample has achieved the specified permeability, the test result will be 15 reported immediately to the CQA certifying engineer. The number of failing tests will be less than the 16 maximum percentage of failing tests specified in Table 2-6. The maximum percentage of failing tests are 17 anticipated to cover laboratory or field recording mistakes, math errors, or other unknown circumstances 18 that are not discovered until after the layer is covered with the succeeding layer(s). Otherwise, all failed 19 tests will be corrected in the field as they are observed. 20 If a defective area is discovered in the SBL other than a failed in-place density test, the CQA 21 representative will determine the extent and nature of the defect. If the defect is indicated by an 22 unsatisfactory test result, the CQA representative will determine the extent of the defective area by 23 additional tests, observations, a review of records, or other means that the CQA representative deems 24 appropriate. If the defect is related to adverse site conditions, such as excessively wet soils or surface 25 desiccation, the CQA representative will define the limits and nature of the defect by testing or 26 observation. After the extent and nature of a defect is determined and remedied by the construction 27 general contractor, the CQA representative will verify that the deficiency has been corrected by re-testing 28 repaired areas before any additional work is performed by the construction general contractor in the area 29 of the deficiency. 30 The testing frequency during the SBL construction may be increased or modified at the discretion of the 31 CQA certifying engineer, when visual observations of construction performance indicate potential 32 problems or when field experience with the proposed SBL material have been obtained. 33 During construction, the frequency of testing may be increased by the CQA representative during adverse 34 weather conditions, if equipment breaks down, at the start and finish of grading, if the material fails to 35 meet the requirements of the technical specifications, or if the extent of the work area is reduced. 36 The construction general contractor will repair all penetrations in the SBL resulting from sampling and 37 other CQA activities, in accordance with the technical specifications. These perforations will be 38 identified to the construction general contractor by the CQA representative. All repairs will be inspected 39 by the CQA representative. 40 The construction general contractor will be required to use all means necessary to protect all prior work as 41 well as all materials and completed work of other sections. In the event of damage, the construction 42 general contractor will be required to make immediately all repairs and replacements necessary. The 43 CQA representative will verify and document that all damages are repaired. 44 2.3.2.2 Layer Completion Certification 45 The construction general contractor will be required to notify the CQA representative when an area of 46 SBL is complete, prior to constructing the overlying layer. The construction general contractor may 47 begin placement of the overlying layer after acceptance of the SBL by the CQA certifying engineer. Appendix 4B.28

The CQA representative will 6 examine GCL rolls upon delivery and deviation from the above requirements will be reported to the CQA 7 certifying engineer prior to installation of the GCL. 8 3.1.2 Transportation and Handling 9 The CQA representative will observe and document that the type of GCL handling equipment used by the 10 installer minimizes damage to the material. Upon delivery at the site, the CQA representative will 11 conduct a visual inspection of all rolls for defects and for damage. This examination will be conducted 12 without unrolling rolls unless visible defects or damages are found. The CQA representative will indicate 13 to the CQA certifying engineer: 14 * Any rolls that need to be unrolled to allow for their inspection. 15 * Any rolls, or portions thereof, that need to be rejected and removed from the site because they 16 have severe flaws. 17 * Any rolls that include minor repairable flaws. 18 3.1.3 Storage 19 The CQA representative will verify and document that storage of the GCL is in accordance with the 20 technical specifications. 21 3.1.4 Inventory 22 All geosynthetic materials that arrive onsite will be inventoried. The inventory will include the specific 23 roll numbers delivered with each shipment. The inventory will be compared to the QC testing 24 information, supplied by the manufacturer to ensure that the material tested is the same material that was 25 delivered to the site. Material for which QC testing data has been supplied will be sampled for 26 conformance testing. Conformance samples may be obtained by the CQA representative at the 27 manufacturing plant or taken upon delivery of the material to the site by a CQA representative. As 28 shipments arrive at the site, a CQA representative will monitor the unloading operations and will 29 inventory the material. Rolls selected for conformance testing will be set aside for sampling as soon as 30 possible. 31 The CQA representative will record the following information, at a minimum, for each roll: 32 * Manufacturer-Indicate the manufacturer of the material that is being inventoried, which may 33 not be the same as the installer. 34 * Date of Inventory-Date that the material was inventoried. 35 * Date of Delivery-Enter date when the truck arrived onsite, if known. 36 * Truck Type-Indicate type of truck used for shipping geosynthetics (covered or uncovered 37 flatbed, box trailer). 38 * Bill of Lading Number-If the bill-of-lading is available, indicate number and date (also attach 39 copy to inventory form). 40 * CQA Representative-Indicate name of CQA representative performing inventory. 41 * Unloading Equipment-Indicate the type and model number of the equipment unloading the 42 geosynthetic material; also note any special attachments that are used to unload the material 43 (stinger, straps, forks).

Accepted materials will be kept separate or clearly delineated 16 from inventoried and approved items, to the extent possible. The CQA representative will be responsible 17 for coordinating with the construction general contractor during material delivery, so that the material is 18 not moved more than necessary after it is unloaded and damage due to handling is minimized. 19 The CQA representative will perform the inventory immediately after the material arrives on the site to 20 avoid delaying construction. The CQA representative will be responsible for verifying that only accepted 21 material is installed at the IDF landfill and that all inventories and inspections are documented and 22 maintained. 23 3.1.5 Quality Assurance Conformance Testing 24 Either at the manufacturer's plant or upon delivery of the rolls of GCL, the CQA representative will 25 ensure that samples are removed at the specified frequency and forwarded to the Geosynthetics CQA 26 Laboratory for testing, to verify and document conformance with the technical specifications. 27 Conformance samples will be taken across the entire width of the roll and will not include the first 3 feet 28 along the length of the roll. Unless otherwise specified, samples will be 1.5 feet (minimum) long by the 29 roll width. The CQA representative will mark the machine direction on the samples with an arrow. 30 Unless otherwise specified, samples will be taken at a rate of one per lot or one per 50,000 square feet, 31 whichever is greater. These samples will be tested for: 32 * Index Flux (ASTM D5887). 33 * Bentonite Mass per Unit Area (ASTM D5993). 34 * Bentonite Swell Index Test (ASTM D5890). 35 The test will be conducted in accordance with the test procedure presented in the technical specifications. 36 The CQA representative will examine all results from laboratory conformance testing and compare the 37 results to the specifications presented in the technical specifications. In addition, the CQA representative 38 will report any non-conformance to the CQA certifying engineer as soon as practical after the test results 39 become available. 40 The following procedure will apply whenever a sample fails a conformance test that is conducted by the 41 Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory: 42 * The construction general contractor will be required to replace the roll (or rolls) of GCL not in 43 conformance with the specifications with a roll, that meets the requirements of the technical 44 specifications. Appendix 4B.37

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility * The CQA representative will ensure that conformance samples are removed for testing by the 2 Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory from the closest numerical roll on both sides of the roll from 3 which the failing sample was obtained. These two samples must pass the above conformance 4 tests. If either of these samples fails to meet the requirements, samples will be collected from the 5 five numerically closest untested rolls on both sides of the failed samples and tested by the 6 Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory. These ten samples must pass the above conformance tests. If 7 any of these samples fail, a sample from every roll of GCL onsite and a sample from every roll 8 that is subsequently delivered from the same manufacturer must be conformance tested by the 9 Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory until the manufacturer has thoroughly demonstrated compliance 10 with the above requirements to the sole satisfaction of the CQA certifying engineer. The costs of 11 all such tests are to be borne by the construction general contractor. 12 * The CQA representative will document actions taken in conjunction with conformance test 13 failures as outlined in Section 8.1.4 and report all actions to the CQA certifying officer. 14 3.2 Geosynthetic Clay Liner Installation 15 3.2.1 Surface Preparation 16 For fill surfaces that will underlay a GCL layer, the CQA representative will verify and document the 17 following: 18 * The surface of the fill does not contain holes, ruts, protrusions, or other surface irregularities in 19 excess of those dimensions specified by the technical specifications. 20 * The surface of the fill has been compacted to form a firm, stable base. 21 * The surface of the fill is free of any type of deleterious material that may cause damage to GCL, 22 including debris, organic material, frozen soil, ice, and rocks. 23 * The surface of the fill is free of standing water or excessive moisture. 24 * The construction general contractor has certified in writing that the surface on which the GCL 25 will be installed is acceptable. 26 The subgrade surface will be inspected immediately prior to commencement of GCL installation. If any 27 change in the surface requires repair work, in accordance with the technical specifications, the 28 construction general contractor will be responsible for repairing the fill surface. 29 A certificate of subgrade surface acceptance will be required from the construction general contractor. 30 The CQA representative will verify that the subgrade is accepted by the GCL installer, immediately prior 31 to commencement of GCL installation. 32 After the surface on which the GCL is to be installed has been accepted by the construction general 33 contractor, it will be the CQA representative's responsibility to indicate to the CQA certifying engineer 34 any change in the underlying layer that may, in accordance with the technical specifications, require 35 repair work. If the CQA certifying engineer requires that repair work be done, it will be the responsibility 36 of the construction general contractor to repair the underlying layer. 37 3.2.2 Anchor Trenches and Sumps 38 Prior to placement of geosynthetics in the anchor trenches or sumps, the CQA representative will verify 39 and document the following: 40 * The sumps and anchor trenches are excavated to the grades and dimensions shown in the 41 construction drawings. Any anomalies in the soil encountered during excavation will be brought 42 to the attention of the IDF project engineer and removed as directed. 43 * The anchor trench excavation surface is prepared for installation of geosynthetics, with rounded 44 corners, and free of loose soil or deleterious material. Appendix 4B.38

--- Page 290 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 After geosynthetics deployment into the anchor trench is complete, the CQA representative will verify 2 and document that the backfill for the geosynthetic anchor trenches is placed and compacted in 3 accordance with the technical specifications. 4 3.2.3 Geosynthetic Clay Liner Deployment 5 3.2.3.1 Field Panel Identification 6 A field panel is the unit area of GCL that is to be placed in the field (i.e., a field panel is a roll or a portion 7 of roll cut in the field). 8 The CQA representative will track the placement location of each GCL panel by assigning an 9 identification code (number or letter-number) or by an equivalent tracking method. The identification 10 method will be agreed upon by the CQA certifying engineer and the construction general contractor. This 11 field panel identification scheme will be as simple and logical as possible. (Note: manufacturing plant 12 roll numbers are usually cumbersome and are not related to location in the field.) It will be the 13 responsibility of the construction general contractor to ensure that each field panel placed is marked with 14 the manufacturing plant roll number. The roll number will be marked in the center of the panel in a color 15 to allow for easy inspection. 16 The CQA representative will establish a table or chart showing correspondence between manufacturing 17 plant roll numbers and field panel identification codes. The field panel identification code will be used 18 for all CQA records. 19 3.2.3.2 Field Panel Placement 20 Installation Schedule 21 The CQA representative will evaluate significant changes in the schedule, proposed by the construction 22 general contractor, and will advise the CQA certifying engineer on the acceptability of that change. The 23 CQA representative will verify and document that the condition of the underlying layer has not changed 24 detrimentally during installation. Any damage to the surface of the underlying layer will be repaired by 25 the construction general contractor, in accordance with the technical specifications. 26 Weather Conditions 27 The CQA representative will verify and document that GCL is not placed during inclement weather 28 conditions, as specified in the technical specifications. Additionally, the CQA monitor will verify and 29 document that the existing underlying layer has not been damaged by weather conditions. 30 Damage 31 The CQA representative will visually observe each panel, after placement, for damage. The CQA 32 representative will inform the construction general contractor which panels, or portions of panels, are 33 rejected, repaired, or accepted. Damaged panels or portions of damaged panels that have been rejected by 34 the CQA representative will be marked, and their removal from the work area will be documented by the 35 CQA representative. 36 Seam Overlap and Bentonite Seal 37 The construction general contractor will observe and document that the seam overlaps and bentonite 38 material placed between panels, if required, along the seams meets specification guidelines. The CQA 39 representative will verify overlap width and will observe bentonite seal placement. 40 3.2.3.3 Field Panel Protection 41 The CQA representative will observe and document that the GCL is completely covered with 42 geomembrane or protective plastic cover at the end of each workday and protected from damage and 43 hydration due to weather. The CQA representative will verify and document that equipment does not 44 operate directly on the GCL and that a smooth rub sheet is used to maneuver textured geomembrane over 45 the GCL to prevent damage to the GCL. Appendix 4B.39

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 3.2.4 Defects and Repairs 2 Any defects and subsequent repairs will be documented, using NCR procedures outlined in Section 8.1.4. 3 3.2.4.1 Identification 4 All seams and non-seam areas of the GCL will be inspected by the CQA representative for evidence of 5 defects, holes, contamination of geotextiles, displaced panels, premature hydration, and any sign of 6 contamination by foreign matter. The CQA representative will observe and document repair procedures 7 described below. 8 3.2.4.2 Repair Procedures 9 Prior to cover material placement, damage to the GCL will be identified and repaired by the installer. 10 Rip and Tear Repair (Flat Surfaces) 11 Rips or tears may be repaired by completely exposing the affected area, removing all foreign objects or 12 soil, and by then placing a patch cut from unused GCL over the damage (damaged material may be left in 13 place), with a minimum overlap of 12 inches on all edges. 14 Accessory bentonite will be placed between the patch edges and the repaired material at a rate of a quarter 15 pound per lineal foot of edge, spread in a continuous 6-inch fillet. 16 Rip and Tear Repair (Slopes) 17 Damaged GCL material on slopes will be repaired by the same procedures as described above, however, 18 the overlapped edges of the patch need to be wide enough to ensure the patch will keep its position during 19 backfill or cover operations. 20 Displaced Panels 21 Displaced panels will be adjusted to the correct position and orientation. The adjusted panel will then be 22 inspected for any geotextile damage or bentonite loss. Damage will be repaired by the above-described 23 procedure. 24 Premature Hydration 25 If the GCL is subjected to premature hydration, the construction general contractor will notify the CQA 26 certifying engineer for a site-specific determination as to whether the material is acceptable or if 27 alternative measures must be taken to ensure the quality of the design dependent upon the degree of 28 damage. 29 Appendix 4B.40

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 SECTION 4 GEOMEMBRANE CONSTRUCTION QUALITY ASSURANCE 2 4.1 Geomembrane Material 3 4.1.1 Labeling 4 The CQA representative will verify and document that the geomembrane manufacturer has labeled each 5 roll of geomembrane and includes the information required by the technical specifications. The CQA 6 representative will examine geomembrane rolls upon delivery and deviation from the requirements will 7 be reported to the CQA certifying engineer, prior to installation of the geomembrane. 8 4.1.2 Transportation and Handling 9 Upon delivery at the site, the CQA representative will conduct a visual inspection of all rolls for defects 10 and damage. This examination will be conducted without unrolling rolls unless visible defects or damage 11 is found. The CQA representative will indicate the following to the CQA certifying engineer: 12 * Any rolls that need to be unrolled to allow for their inspection. 13 * Any rolls, or portions thereof, that need to be rejected and removed from the site because they 14 have severe flaws. 15 * Any rolls that include minor repairable flaws. 16 4.1.3 Storage 17 The CQA representative will verify and document that storage of the geomembrane is in accordance with 18 the technical specifications. 19 4.1.4 Inventory 20 All geosynthetic materials that arrive onsite will be inventoried in accordance with the technical 21 specifications. The inventory will include the specific roll numbers delivered with each shipment. The 22 inventory will be compared to the QC testing information supplied by the manufacturer to ensure that the 23 material tested is the same material that was delivered to the site. Material for which QC testing data has 24 been supplied will be sampled for conformance testing. Conformance samples may be obtained by the 25 CQA representative at the manufacturing plant or taken upon delivery of the material to the site by a CQA 26 representative. As shipments arrive at the site, a CQA representative will monitor the unloading 27 operations and will inventory the material. Rolls selected for conformance testing will be set aside for 28 sampling as soon as possible. 29 The CQA representative will record the following information, at a minimum, for each roll: 30 * Manufacturer-indicate the manufacturer of the material that is being inventoried, that may not 31 be the same as the installer. 32 * Date of Inventory-Date that the material was inventoried. 33 * Date of Delivery-Enter date when the truck arrived onsite, if known. 34 * Truck Type-Indicate type of truck used for shipping geosynthetics (covered or uncovered 35 flatbed, box trailer). 36 * Bill-of-Lading Number-If the bill-of-lading is available, indicate number and date (also attach 37 copy to inventory form). 38 * CQA Representative-Indicate name of CQA representative performing inventory. 39 * Unloading Equipment-Indicate the type and model number of the equipment unloading the 40 geosynthetic material; also note any special attachments that are used to unload the material 41 (stinger, straps, forks). 42 * Weather Conditions-Describe the weather conditions, including temperature, wind, cloud cover, 43 and precipitation during unloading and conformance sampling operation. 44 * Material Type-Indicate type of geosynthetic material (HDPE, geotextile, or geonet) Appendix 4B.41

--- Page 293 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Roll Number-Indicate each roll number that is indicated on the roll. (The roll numbers contain a 2 variety of information regarding the material and the manufacture process.) 3 * Lot Number-Lot number as indicated. 4 * Roll (L x W)-Indicate the roll width as indicated on the roll label; if two materials are bonded 5 together (i.e., geonet/geotextile), obtain measurements for both materials. 6 * Area (square feet)-Indicate the total square footage of the roll. 7 * Damage Remarks-Document any visible damage to the roll; if possible, indicate if damage was 8 present prior to unloading or if it occurred during unloading. 9 Items that are restricted from further use until the inspections have been completed will be clearly 10 delineated by the CQA representative. Accepted materials will be kept separate or clearly delineated 11 from inventoried and approved items to the extent possible. The CQA representative will be responsible 12 for coordinating with the construction general contractor during material delivery, so that the material is 13 not moved more than necessary after it is unloaded and damage due to handling is minimized. 14 The CQA representative will perform the inventory immediately after the material arrives onsite to avoid 15 delaying construction. The CQA representative will be responsible for verifying that only accepted 16 material is installed at the IDF landfill, and that all inventories and inspections are documented and 17 maintained. 18 4.1.5 Quality Assurance Conformance Testing 19 Either at the manufacturer's plant or upon delivery of the rolls of geomembrane, the CQA representative 20 will ensure that samples are removed at the specified frequency and forwarded to the Geosynthetics CQA 21 Laboratory for testing to verify and document conformance with the technical specifications. 22 Conformance samples will be taken by the CQA representative across the entire width of the roll and will 23 not include the first 3 feet. Unless otherwise specified, samples will be 3 feet (minimum) long by the roll 24 width. The CQA representative will mark the direction of the machine used to cut the samples with an 25 arrow. 26 Unless otherwise specified, samples will be taken at a rate of one per lot or one per 50,000 square feet, 27 whichever is greater. These samples will be tested for: 28 * Thickness (ASTM D5199 or D5994). 29 * Tensile characteristics (yield strength and elongation at yield, ASTM D638). 30 * Asperity (GRI GM-12). 31 * Puncture resistance (ASTM D4833). 32 Test will be conducted in accordance with the test procedure presented in the technical specifications. 33 The CQA representative will examine all results from laboratory conformance testing and will report any 34 non-conformance after the test results become available. The following procedure will apply whenever a 35 sample fails a conformance test that is conducted by the CQA representative: 36 * The construction general contractor will be required to replace the roll (or rolls) of geomembrane 37 in non-conformance with the technical specifications with a roll, that meets the technical 38 specifications. 39 * The CQA certifying engineer will ensure that conformance samples are removed for testing by 40 the Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory from the closest numerical roll on both sides of the failed roll. 41 These two samples must pass the above conformance tests. If either of these samples fails, 42 samples will be collected from the five numerically closest untested rolls on both sides of the 43 failed sample and tested by the Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory. These ten samples must pass the 44 above conformance tests. Appendix 4B.42

--- Page 294 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 If any of these samples fail, a sample from every roll of geomembrane onsite and every roll 2 subsequently delivered from the same manufacturer must be conformance tested by the 3 Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory, until the manufacturer has thoroughly demonstrated compliance 4 with the above requirements to the sole satisfaction of the CQA certifying engineer. The costs of 5 all such tests are to be borne by the construction general contractor. 6 4.1.6 Manufacturing Plant Site Visit 7 The manufacturer shall allow the CQA certifying engineer or his designated representative to visit the 8 manufacturing plant, if the CQA certifying engineer so chooses. If possible, the visit shall be prior to or 9 during the manufacturing of the geomembrane rolls for the specific project. The CQA Engineer or his 10 designated representative shall review the manufacturing process, quality control, laboratory facilities, 11 and testing procedures as described in the technical specifications (see Section 02661). 12 4.2 Installation 13 4.2.1 Surface Preparation 14 For SBL surfaces that will underlay a geomembrane layer, the CQA representative will verify and 15 document the following: 16 * The surface of the subgrade or SBL does not contain holes, depressions, or protrusions in excess 17 of those dimensions specified by the technical specifications. 18 * The surface of the subgrade or SBL has been rolled with a smooth-drum roller to form a firm 19 stable base without ridges, wheel ruts, and surface irregularities. 20 * The surface of the subgrade or SBL is free of any type of deleterious material that may cause 21 damage to geomembrane. 22 * The construction general contractor has certified in writing that the surface on which the 23 geomembrane will be installed is acceptable. 24 The subgrade and SBL surface will be inspected immediately prior to commencement of geomembrane 25 installation. If any change in the surface requires repair work, in accordance with the technical 26 specifications, the construction general contractor will be responsible for repairing the surface. A 27 certificate of subgrade surface acceptance will be required from the construction general contractor. The 28 CQA representative will verify that the subgrade is accepted by the geomembrane installer immediately 29 prior to commencement of geomembrane installation. 30 After the surface on which the geomembrane is to be installed has been accepted by the construction 31 general contractor, it will be the CQA representative's responsibility to indicate to the CQA certifying 32 engineer any change in the underlying layer that may, in accordance with the technical specifications, 33 require repair work. If the CQA certifying engineer requires that repair work be done, it will be the 34 responsibility of the construction general contractor to repair the underlying layer. 35 4.2.2 Anchor Trenches and Sumps 36 Prior to placement of geosynthetics in the anchor trenches or sumps, the CQA representative will verify 37 and document the following: 38 * The excavation of the sumps and anchor trenches is performed in accordance with the technical 39 specifications. Any anomalies in the soil encountered during excavation will be brought to the 40 attention of the IDF project engineer and removed as directed. 41 * The anchor trench excavation surface is prepared for installation of geosynthetics with rounded 42 corners and is free of loose soil or deleterious material. 43 After geosynthetics deployment into the anchor trench is complete, the CQA representative will verify 44 and document that the backfill for the geosynthetic anchor trenches is placed and compacted in 45 accordance with the technical specifications and construction drawings. Appendix 4B.43

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4.2.3 Geomembrane Deployment 2 4.2.3.1 Layout Drawing 3 The construction general contractor will be required to produce layout drawings that show the 4 geomembrane panel configuration, dimensions, details, and seam locations. The layout drawings must be 5 approved by the CQA certifying engineer, prior to the installation of the geomembrane. 6 4.2.3.2 Field Panel Identification 7 A field panel is the unit area of geomembrane that is to be seamed in the field (i.e., a field panel is a roll 8 or a portion of roll cut in the field). 9 The CQA representative will verify that each field panel is given an identification code (number or letter- 10 number) consistent with the layout plan. This identification code will be agreed upon by the CQA 11 representative and the construction general contractor. This field panel identification code will be as 12 simple and logical as possible. (Note: manufacturing plant roll numbers are usually cumbersome and are 13 not related to location in the field.) It will be the responsibility of the construction general contractor to 14 ensure that each field panel placed is marked with the manufacturing plant roll number. The roll number 15 will be marked in the center of the panel in a color to allow for easy inspection. 16 The CQA representative will establish a table or chart showing correspondence between manufacturing 17 plant roll numbers and field panel identification codes. The field panel identification code will be used for 18 all CQA records. 19 4.2.3.3 Field Panel Placement 20 Location 21 The CQA representative will verify and document that field panels are installed at the locations and 22 positions indicated in the construction general contractor's layout plan, as approved or modified by the 23 CQA certifying engineer. 24 Installation Schedule 25 The CQA representative will evaluate significant changes in the schedule, proposed by the construction 26 general contractor, and will advise the CQA certifying engineer on the acceptability of that change. The 27 CQA representative will verify and document that the condition of the underlying layer has not changed 28 detrimentally during installation. Any damage to the surface of the underlying layer will be repaired by 29 the construction general contractor in accordance with the technical specifications. 30 The CQA representative will record the identification code, location, and date of installation of each field 31 panel. 32 Weather Conditions 33 The CQA representative will verify and document that geomembrane is not placed during inclement 34 weather conditions, as specified in the technical specifications. Additionally, the CQA representative will 35 verify and document that the underlying layer has not been damaged by weather conditions. 36 Damage 37 The CQA representatives will visually observe each panel, after placement and prior to seaming, for 38 damage (e.g., holes, blisters, and creases). The CQA representative will inform the construction general 39 contractor which panels, or portions of panels, need to be rejected, repaired, or accepted. Damaged panels 40 or portions of damaged panels that have been rejected by the CQA certifying engineer will be marked, 41 and their removal from the work area will be documented by the CQA representative, using the NCR 42 procedures outlined in Section 8.1.4. Appendix 4B.44

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4.2.4 Field Seaming 2 4.2.4.1 Seam Layout 3 The CQA certifying engineer will verify and document that the seam layout shown in the panel layout 4 drawing is consistent with the technical specifications. A seam numbering system compatible with the 5 panel numbering system will be agreed upon by the construction general contractor and CQA certifying 6 engineer. 7 4.2.4.2 Seaming Equipment and Products 8 Processes approved by the technical specifications for field seaming are extrusion seaming; and fusion 9 seaming. Proposed alternate processes will be required to be documented and submitted to the CQA 10 certifying engineer for approval. The construction general contractor will be required to use a pyrometer 11 to ensure that accurate temperatures of the extrudate and seamer nozzle are being achieved. 12 The extrusion seaming apparatus will be equipped with gauges, indicating the temperatures of the 13 extrudate and nozzle. The construction general contractor will be required to provide to the CQA 14 certifying engineer the manufacturer's certification that the extrudate is compatible with the 15 geomembrane material and is comprised of the same resin as the geomembrane. 16 The CQA representative will log ambient temperatures, seaming apparatus temperatures, and extrudate 17 temperatures or fusion seaming apparatus speeds. Ambient temperatures will be measured to verify 18 compliance with the technical specifications. 19 4.2.4.3 Seam Preparation 20 The CQA certifying engineer will verify and document the following: 21 * Prior to seaming, the seam area is clean and free of moisture, dust, dirt, debris, and foreign 22 material. 23 * Preparation of seams is in accordance with the technical specifications. 24 4.2.4.4 Weather Conditions for Seaming 25 The CQA representative will verify and document that weather conditions for seaming are within the 26 limits specified in the technical specifications. 27 4.2.4.5 Trial Seams 28 The construction general contractor will be required to make trial seams on fragment pieces of 29 geomembrane liner to verify that seaming conditions are adequate. The construction general contractor 30 will be required to make and test trial seams at the frequency and in accordance with the methods 31 specified in the technical specifications. 32 The CQA representative will observe all trial seam procedures. The trial seam samples will be assigned a 33 number and marked accordingly by the CQA representative, along with the date, hour, ambient 34 temperature, number of seaming unit, name of seamer, and pass or fail description. A sample of the trial 35 seam will be retained by the CQA team until the construction of the liner is complete and the liner has 36 been accepted by the CQA certifying engineer. 37 4.2.4.6 Nondestructive Seam Continuity Testing 38 Except as otherwise noted in the technical specifications, the construction general contractor will 39 nondestructively test all field seams over their full length, in accordance with the technical specifications. 40 The purpose of nondestructive tests is to check the continuity of seams. Continuity testing will be carried 41 out as the seaming work progresses, not at the completion of all field seaming. 42 Appendix 4B.45

--- Page 297 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Nondestructive testing will not be permitted before sunrise or after sunset unless the construction general 2 contractor demonstrates to the CQA certifying engineer that the construction general contractor has the 3 capabilities to perform continuity testing under reduced light conditions. The CQA representative will 4 perform the following tasks: 5 * Observe the continuity testing. 6 * Record location, date, test unit number, name of tester, and outcome of all testing 7 * Document and inform the construction general contractor of any required repairs. 8 The construction general contractor will be required to complete any required repairs, in accordance with 9 the technical specifications. The CQA representative will perform the following tasks: 10 * Observe the repair and re-testing of the repair. 11 * Mark on the geomembrane that the repair has been made. 12 * Document the results. 13 The CQA representative will verify and document the procedures specified in the technical specifications 14 where seams cannot be nondestructively tested. The location, date of visual observation, name of tester, 15 and outcome of the test or observation will be recorded by the CQA representative and reported to the 16 CQA certifying engineer. 17 4.2.4.7 Destructive Seam Testing 18 Concept 19 Destructive seam tests will be performed at selected locations. The purpose of these tests is to evaluate 20 seam strength and integrity. Seam strength testing will be done as the seaming work progresses, not at 21 the completion of all field seaming. 22 Location and Frequency 23 The CQA representative will select locations where seam samples will be cut out for laboratory testing at 24 the frequency specified in the technical specifications (see Section 02661). In general, destructive tests 25 will be located in non-critical areas, such as seam run-out areas or near three-panel intersections or other 26 areas that will require a patch anyway. In addition, because extrusion welding may be limited on a daily 27 basis, extrusion destructive samples may be welded after passing a trial seam on scrap material not used 28 for construction. However, when significant lengths (greater than 100 feet) of seams or caps are extrusion 29 welded, a destructive test of the weld will be taken. 30 Control charts will be used to track the performance of each welding machine and technician to allow for 31 biased sampling, according to performance. An upper control limit (UCL) will be established to identify 32 statistically the sources of test failures. Machines and technicians whose failure rates exceed the UCL 33 will then be identified and destructively tested at twice the original frequency (one per 250 feet of seam 34 length) to better monitor their performance. Once the failure rate drops back into compliance with the 35 UCL, the original testing frequency will be reinstated. Machines and technicians whose failure notes are 36 below the UCL will be identified to decrease the original frequency, as approved by the CQA certifying 37 engineer. 38 The UCL is established based on the failure rate for all destructive tests plus three standard deviations 39 with a ceiling of 3.5 percent. The ceiling is the maximum failure rate determined to be acceptable, as 40 agreed upon jointly by the construction general contractor and CQA certifying engineer. The initial UCL 41 will be calculated once a single machine or technician fails two destructive tests and will typically be 42 updated daily with the most recent destructive testing results. Destructive tests tracking a failed 43 destructive will not be included in the calculation of the failure rates. 44 45 Appendix 4B.46

--- Page 298 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Additional destructive test locations may be required during seaming operations. The necessity for such 2 additional sampling and testing will be determined by CQA representatives and will be implemented 3 when there is cause to suspect the presence of excess crystallinity, contamination, offset welds, or any 4 other reason to suspect potentially defective seams. The location selection of the additional testing will 5 be based on the CQA representative's judgment and observation of a suspected problem. 6 The construction general contractor will not be informed in advance of the locations where the seam 7 samples will be taken. 8 Sampling Procedure 9 The construction general contractor will be required to cut samples, as directed by the CQA representative 10 as the seaming progresses, in order to have laboratory test results before the geomembrane is covered by 11 another material. The CQA representative will perform the following tasks: 12 * Observe sample cutting. 13 * Assign a number to each sample and mark it accordingly. 14 * Record the sample number and location on the panel layout drawing. 15 * Record the reason for taking the sample at this location (e.g., routine testing, suspicious feature of 16 the geomembrane). 17 All holes in the geomembrane resulting from destructive seam sampling will be covered by the 18 construction general contractor immediately after sampling and will be repaired in accordance with the 19 repair procedures described in the technical specifications. The continuity of the new seams in the 20 repaired area will be nondestructively tested, according to the technical specifications. 21 Size of Samples 22 At a given sampling location, two types of samples will be taken by the construction general contractor. 23 First, two specimens for field-testing will be taken. Each of these specimens will be 1 inch wide by 6 to 24 12 inches long, with the seam centered parallel to the width. The distance between these two specimens 25 will be approximately 42 inches. If both specimens pass the field test described in the technical 26 specifications, a sample for laboratory testing will be taken. 27 The sample for laboratory testing will be required to be taken between the two specimens for field-testing. 28 The destructive sample will be 12 inches wide by 42 inches long, with the seam centered lengthwise. The 29 sample will be cut into three parts and distributed as follows: 30 * One portion to the construction general contractor, 12 inches long. 31 * One portion to the IDF CM for archive storage, 12 inches long. 32 * One portion to the CQA certifying engineer for CQA Laboratory testing, 18 inches long. 33 Final determination of the sample sizes will be made at the preconstruction meeting. 34 Field Testing 35 The two 1-inch-wide specimens, as specified above, will be required to be tested in the field by the CQA 36 representative by tensiometer for peel and shear and need not to fail in the seam. If any field test sample 37 fails to pass, the procedures outlined in the technical specifications will be followed. 38 The CQA representative will mark all samples and portions with their number, date, and time. 39 Geosynthetic Construction Quality Assurance Laboratory Testing 40 Laboratory destructive test samples will be packaged and shipped to the Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory 41 by the CQA representative in a manner that will not damage the test sample. The CQA representative 42 will store the archive samples until the completion of the project. 43 Testing will include "Shear Strength" and "Peel Strength" (ASTM D6392) with 1-inch-wide strip, tested 44 at 2 inches per minute. The minimum acceptable values to be obtained in these tests are those indicated in 45 the technical specifications. At least five specimens will be tested for each test method. Appendix 4B.47

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Specimens will be selected alternately by test from the samples (i.e., peel, shear, peel, and shear). At least 2 four out of five of the specimens for each test must pass. 3 The laboratory will provide test results verbally to the CQA certifying engineer in a timely manner after 4 they receive and test the samples. The CQA certifying engineer will review laboratory test results as soon 5 as they become available and will inform the CQA certifying engineer of the test results. 6 Procedures for Destructive Test Failure 7 The procedures specified in the technical specifications will be required whenever a sample fails a 8 destructive test, whether that test is conducted by the Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory or by field 9 tensiometer. The CQA certifying engineer will verify and document that one of the options specified in 10 the technical specifications is followed. The CQA representative will document all actions taken in 11 conjunction with destructive test failures, including preparation of NCRs, as outlined in Section 8.1.4. 12 4.2.5 Defects and Repairs 13 4.2.5.1 Identification 14 All seams and non-seam areas of the geomembrane will be inspected by the CQA representative for 15 evidence of defects, holes, blisters, undispersed raw materials, and any sign of contamination by foreign 16 matter. Because light reflected by the geomembrane helps to detect defects, the surface of the 17 geomembrane will be required to be clean at the time of examination. The geomembrane surface will be 18 required to be swept or washed by the construction general contractor if the amount of dust or mud 19 inhibits examination. 20 4.2.5.2 Evaluation 21 Each suspect location both in seam and non-seam areas will be required to be either non-destructively 22 tested using the methods described in the technical specifications, or repaired as appropriate as 23 determined by the CQA certifying engineer. Each location that fails the non-destructive testing will be 24 marked by the CQA representative and will be required to be repaired by the construction general 25 contractor. Materials will not be placed over geomembrane locations that have been repaired until the 26 CQA representative has approved the repair. 27 4.2.5.3 Large Wrinkles 28 When seaming of the geomembrane is completed (or when seaming of a large area of the geomembrane is 29 completed) and prior to placing overlying materials, the CQA representative will visually inspect the 30 geomembrane for wrinkles. Based on the requirements of the technical specifications, the CQA 31 representative will indicate to the construction general contractor, which wrinkles, if any, are to be cut, 32 overlapped, and seamed to remove the wrinkle. The seam thus produced will be tested like any other 33 seam. 34 4.2.5.4 Repair Procedures 35 Any portion of the geomembrane either exhibiting a flaw or failing a destructive or nondestructive test 36 will be repaired by the construction general contractor in accordance with the applicable method specified 37 in the technical specifications. An NCR will be prepared to document all flaws and failed tests, as 38 outlined in Section 8.1.4. Each repair will be located and logged by the CQA representative. 39 4.2.5.5 Testing of Repairs 40 Each repair will be non-destructively tested, using the methods described in the technical specifications as 41 appropriate. Repairs that pass the non-destructive test will be considered adequate. Large caps may be of 42 sufficient extent to require destructive testing, at the discretion of the CQA certifying engineer. Failed 43 tests will require the repair to be redone and re-tested until passing test results are obtained. The CQA 44 representative will observe the non-destructive testing of repairs and will document the date of the repair 45 and test outcome. Appendix 4B.48

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4.2.6 Appurtenances 2 The CQA representative will verify and document the following: 3 * Installation of the geomembrane around, and connection of geomembrane to, appurtenances have 4 been made according to the technical specifications or manufacturer's recommendations. 5 * Extreme care is taken while seaming around appurtenances, since neither non-destructive nor 6 destructive testing may be feasible in these areas. 7 * The geomembrane has not been visibly damaged while being connected to appurtenances. 8 The CQA representative will inform the CQA certifying engineer if the above conditions are not fulfilled. 9 4.3 Geomembrane Panel Layout Survey 10 A survey will be performed by or under the direction of a professional land surveyor registered in the 11 State of Washington. The surveyor will independently survey the elevations and location of each panel 12 intersection and destructive sample. The results of the survey conducted by the surveyor will be compiled 13 in a report signed by the surveyor and the CQA certifying engineer. 14 The surveyor will be required to survey each geomembrane panel intersection and destructive sample 15 location for the IDF landfill, in accordance with the requirements of this CQA Plan. A record drawing 16 will be submitted to the CQA certifying engineer by the surveyor. The survey will include enough 17 information to confirm that the geomembrane layout is in accordance with the panel layout and include, 18 but not be limited to, the following information: 19 Geomembrane panel intersections: 20 * Destructive sample location and identification 21 * Edge of geomembrane liner 22 * Panel identification numbers 23 Each geomembrane layer will be surveyed including, but not be limited to: 24 * Secondary leak detection system geomembrane 25 * Secondary geomembrane 26 * Primary geomembrane 27 4.4 Layer Completion Certification 28 The construction general contractor will be required to notify the CQA representative when an area of 29 geomembrane is complete, prior to constructing the overlying layer. The construction general contractor 30 may place overlying layer after acceptance of geomembrane layer by the CQA Certifying Engineer. The 31 CQA certifying engineer will provide a certificate of layer completion to the construction general 32 contractor and the IDF project engineer, certifying that all CQA tests are complete and all defects have 33 been repaired and tested. 34 Appendix 4B.49

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 SECTION 5 GEOTEXTILE CONSTRUCTION QUALITY ASSURANCE 2 5.1 Geotextile Material And Installation 3 5.1.1 Labeling 4 The CQA representative will verify and document that the geotextile manufacturer has labeled all rolls of 5 geotextile with the information specified in the technical specifications. The CQA representative will 6 examine rolls upon delivery, and any deviation from the requirements will be reported to the CQA 7 certifying engineer. Geotextile rolls that are not labeled or that have illegible labels will be removed and 8 disposed by the construction general contractor. 9 5.1.2 Transportation and Handling 10 The CQA representative will observe rolls of geotextile upon delivery at the site, and any deviation from 11 the transportation and handling requirements specified in the technical specifications will be reported to 12 the CQA certifying engineer. Any damaged rolls will be rejected by the CQA certifying engineer and 13 required to be repaired or replaced by the construction general contractor. 14 5.1.3 Storage 15 The CQA representative will verify and document that storage of the geotextile is in accordance with the 16 technical specifications. 17 5.1.4 Inventory 18 All geotextile materials that arrive onsite will be inventoried. The inventory will include the specific roll 19 numbers delivered with each shipment. The inventory will be compared to the QC testing information, 20 supplied by the manufacturer to ensure that the material tested is the same material that was delivered to 21 the site. Material for which QC testing data has been supplied will be sampled for conformance testing. 22 Conformance samples may be obtained by the CQA representative at the manufacturing plant or taken 23 upon delivery of the material to the site by a CQA representative. 24 As shipments arrive at the site, a CQA representative will monitor the unloading operations and will 25 inventory the material. Rolls selected for conformance testing will be set aside for sampling as soon as 26 possible. 27 The CQA representative will record the following information, at a minimum, for each roll: 28 * Manufacturer-Indicate the manufacturer of the material that is being inventoried, that may not 29 be the same as the installer. 30 * Date of Inventory-Date that the material was inventoried. 31 * Date of Delivery-Enter date when the truck arrived onsite, if known. 32 * Truck Type-Indicate type of truck used for shipping geosynthetics (covered or uncovered 33 flatbed, box trailer). 34 * Bill-of-Lading Number-If the bill-of-lading is available, indicate number and date (also attach 35 copy to inventory form). 36 * CQA Representative-Indicate name of CQA representative performing inventory. 37 * Unloading Equipment-Indicate the type and model number of the equipment unloading the 38 geosynthetic material; also note any special attachments that are used to unload the material 39 (stinger, straps, forks). 40 * Weather Conditions-Describe the weather conditions, including temperature, wind, cloud cover, 41 and precipitation during unloading and conformance sampling operation. 42 * Material Type-Indicate type of geosynthetic material. 43 * Roll Number-Indicate each roll number that is indicated on the roll. 44 * Lot Number-Lot number. Appendix 4B.50

--- Page 302 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Roll (Lx W)-Indicate the roll width as indicated on the roll label; if two materials are bonded 2 together (i.e., geonet/geotextile), obtain measurements for both materials. 3 * Area (square feet)-Indicate the total square footage of the roll. 4 * Damage Remarks-Document any visible damage to the roll; if possible, indicate if damage was 5 present prior to unloading or if it occurred during unloading. 6 Items that are restricted from further use until the inspections have been completed will be clearly 7 delineated by the CQA representative. Accepted materials will be kept separate or clearly delineated 8 from inventoried and approved items to the extent possible. The CQA representative will coordinate with 9 the construction general contractor during material delivery so that the material is not moved more than 10 necessary after it is unloaded and damage due to handling is minimized. 11 The CQA representative will perform the inventory immediately after the material arrives onsite to avoid 12 delaying construction. The CQA representative will be responsible for verifying that only accepted 13 material is installed at the IDF landfill and that all inventories and inspections are documented and 14 maintained. 15 5.1.5 Conformance Testing 16 Either at the manufacturer's factory or upon delivery of the geotextile rolls, the CQA representative will 17 ensure that samples are removed and forwarded to the Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory for testing to 18 verify and document conformance with the requirements of the technical specifications. Conformance 19 samples will be taken across the entire width of the roll and will not include the first 3 feet along the edge 20 of the roll. Unless otherwise specified, samples will be 3 feet (minimum) long by the roll width. The 21 CQA representative will mark the machine direction on the samples with an arrow. 22 Samples will be taken at a rate of one per material lot or one per 50,000 square foot, whichever is greater. 23 These samples will be tested for the following: 24 * Permittivity (ASTM D4491, Type 1 only). 25 * Grab strength (ASTM D4632). 26 * Tear strength (ASTM D4533). 27 * Puncture strength (ASTM D4833). 28 The CQA representative will examine all results of laboratory conformance testing and report any non- 29 conformance to the CQA certifying engineer as soon as results become available. The following 30 procedure will apply whenever a sample fails a conformance test that is conducted by the Geosynthetics 31 CQA Laboratory: 32 * The construction general contractor will replace the roll (or rolls) of geotextile not in 33 conformance with the specifications with a roll, that meets the requirements of the technical 34 specifications. 35 * The CQA representative will ensure that conformance samples are removed for testing by the 36 Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory from the closest numerical roll on both sides of the roll from 37 which the failing sample was obtained. These two samples must pass the above conformance 38 tests. If either of these samples fails to meet the requirements, samples will be collected from the 39 five numerically closest untested rolls on both sides of the failed sample and tested by the 40 Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory. These ten samples must pass the above conformance tests. If 41 any of these samples fail, a sample from every roll of geotextile onsite and a sample from every 42 roll that is subsequently delivered from the same manufacturer must be conformance tested by the 43 Geosynthetics CQA Laboratory, until the manufacturer has thoroughly demonstrated compliance 44 with the above requirements to the sole satisfaction of the CQA certifying engineer. The costs of 45 all such tests are to be borne by the construction general contractor. Appendix 4B.51

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I The CQA representative will document actions taken in conjunction with conformance test failures and 2 report all actions taken to the CQA certifying engineer. Failed tests will be documented using NCR 3 procedures, outlined in Section 8.1.4. 4 5.1.6 Deployment 5 The construction general contractor will be required to handle all geotextile material in such a manner as 6 to ensure that it is not damaged in any way. 7 It will be the CQA representative's responsibility to indicate to the CQA certifying engineer any change 8 in the underlying layer that may, in accordance with the technical specifications, require repair work. If 9 the CQA certifying engineer requires that repair work be done, it will be the responsibility of the 10 construction general contractor to repair the underlying layer. 11 The CQA representative will verify and document compliance with the following: 12 * Just prior to geotextile placement, the layer that underlies the geotextile, if it is a geosynthetic, is 13 clean and free of excessive amounts of dust, dirt, stones, rocks, or other obstructions that could 14 potentially damage the liner system. 15 * In the presence of excessive wind, the geotextile is weighted with sandbags (or equivalent weight 16 approved by the CQA representative). 17 * Geotextile is kept under tension to minimize the presence of wrinkles in the geotextile. If 18 necessary, the geotextile is positioned by hand after being unrolled to minimize wrinkles. 19 * Geotextile is cut using a geotextile cutter approved by the geotextile manufacturer and the CQA 20 representative. If in place, special care is taken to protect other materials (such as underlying 21 geosynthetics) from damage that could be caused by the cutting of the geotextiles. 22 * The construction general contractor takes any necessary precautions to prevent damage to the 23 underlying layers during placement of the geotextile. 24 * During placement of geotextile, care is taken not to entrap stones, excessive dust, or moisture that 25 could damage the underlying layers, generate clogging of drains or filters, or hamper subsequent 26 seaming. 27 * Geotextile is not left exposed for an excess of 14 days after placement, to prevent damage from 28 exposure to ultraviolet radiation (sunlight). If the geotextile is exposed for more than 14 days, a 29 temporary cover may be deployed for the duration of the delay or samples may be submitted to an 30 independent testing laboratory to ensure that detrimental levels of UV degradation have not 31 occurred. Test results shall be submitted to CQA certifying engineer for review and approval. 32 Detrimental level of UV degradation is defined in the technical specifications (see Section 33 02371). 34 The CQA representative will document any non-compliance with the above requirements and report them 35 to the CQA certifying engineer. 36 5.1.7 Seams and Overlaps 37 The CQA representative will verify and document that all geotextile seams are oriented and overlapped, 38 in accordance with the technical specifications. The construction general contractor will be required to 39 pay close attention at seams to ensure that no protective soil layer material could be inadvertently placed 40 beneath the geotextile. 41 5.1.8 Repair 42 The CQA representative will verify and document that any holes or tears in the geotextile are repaired, in 43 accordance with the requirements of the technical specifications. The CQA representative will document 44 any noncompliance with the above requirements and report it to the CQA certifying engineer. Appendix 4B.52

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The CQA representative will also note the condition of the interior of pipes and fittings. Foreign material 2 will be removed from the pipe interior before it is moved into final position. No pipe will be permitted to 3 be placed until the CQA representative has observed the condition of the pipe. The CQA representative 4 will document any deviation from the requirements and report it to the CQA certifying engineer. 5 7.1.7 Joints and Connections 6 Lengths of pipe will be required to be assembled into suitable installation lengths by the butt-fusion 7 process. Butt-fusion refers to the butt joining of the pipe by softening the aligned faces of the pipe ends 8 in a suitable apparatus and pressing them together under controlled pressure. The CQA representatives 9 will spot-monitor butt-fusion welding operations to ensure that the construction general contractor 10 follows the technical specifications for both slotted and solid pipes. The CQA representative will verify 11 that internal weld beads have been removed from the horizontal and side slope sections of the LCRS, 12 LDS, and SLDS riser pipes. The CQA representative will document any noncompliance with the 13 requirements and report it to the CQA certifying engineer. 14 7.1.8 Surveying 15 A survey will be performed by or under the direction of a professional land surveyor registered in the 16 State of Washington. The surveyor will independently survey the final elevation and alignment of the top 17 of the pipe and fittings. Surveys will be performed on all pipe locations within the footprint of the landfill 18 to confirm that the alignment and elevations in the field agree with those shown in the construction 19 drawings. The results of the survey will be compiled in a report signed by the surveyor and the CQA 20 certifying engineer. 21 The surveyor will be required to survey each pipe location within the IDF landfill, in accordance with the 22 requirements of this CQA Plan. A record drawing will be submitted to the CQA certifying engineer by 23 the surveyor before placement of the next liner system layer. The surveys will be conducted every 50 feet 24 along the pipe alignment and appurtenances. The survey will include enough information to confirm that 25 the following features of the landfill piping are constructed in accordance with the construction drawings: 26 * Beginning and end top of pipe elevations 27 * Connection location 28 * Grade breaks 29 * Riser pipes 30 0 Sump extensions 31 The piping that will be surveyed will include, but not be limited to, the following: 32 * SLDS piping 33 * LDS piping 34 * LCRS piping 35 The CQA certifying engineer will approve the survey results for each layer before the subsequent 36 component of the lining system is constructed. 37 Appendix 4B.58

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 SECTION 8 CONSTRUCTION QUALITY ASSURANCE DOCUMENTATION AND 2 CERTIFICATION 3 8.1 Documentation and Certification 4 A major function of CQA is to properly and adequately document and certify the work. This section 5 describes the minimum required documentation. The CQA certifying engineer may recommend to the 6 IDF CM additional documentation for performing CQA tasks that are for certification. In addition, the 7 CQA certifying engineer will prepare forms, field data sheets, sample labeling schemes, and chain-of- 8 custody procedures and submit them to the IDF CM and IDF PM for approval, prior to construction. 9 8.1.1 Daily Reports 10 Daily reports will be completed by the CQA representatives when they are onsite. All CQA personnel 11 will be assigned field books by the CQA certifying engineer that will be labeled with a unique number. 12 The CQA representatives, including the CQA certifying engineer, will record all field observations and 13 the results of field tests in their assigned field book. When not in use, all field books will be left in the 14 field records file. After each book is filled (or at the end of the project), the field book will be returned to 15 the CQA certifying engineer and routed to the project files. 16 Each page of the field book will be numbered, dated, and initialed by CQA personnel. At the start of a 17 new work shift, CQA personnel will list the following information at the top of the page: 18 * Job name 19 * Job number 20 * Date 21 * Name 22 * Weather conditions 23 * Page number (if pages are not pre-numbered) 24 The remaining individual entries will be prefaced by an indication of the time at which they occurred. If 25 the results of test data are being recorded on separate sheets, it will be noted in the field book. Entries in 26 the field book will include, but not be limited to, the following information: 27 * Reports on any meetings held and their results. 28 * Equipment and personnel being used in each location, including construction general contractors. 29 * Descriptions of areas being observed and documented. 30 * Descriptions of materials delivered to the site, including any quality verification (vendor 31 certification) documentation. 32 * Descriptions of materials incorporated into construction. 33 * Calibrations, or recalibrations, of test equipment, including actions taken as a result of 34 recalibration. 35 * Decisions made regarding use of material and/or corrective actions to be taken in instances of 36 substandard quality. 37 * Unique identifying sheet numbers of inspection data sheets and/or problem reporting and 38 corrective measures reports used to substantiate the decisions described in the preceding item 39 At the end of each day, the field CQA monitor will summarize the day's activities on a daily field 40 monitoring report form. The field report will include a brief summary of the day's activities and highlight 41 any unresolved issues that must be addressed by the CQA certifying engineer or by CQA representatives 42 the following day. 43 The daily field monitoring report will be filled out in triplicate. The CQA monitor will attach three copies 44 of the field book notes for that day. The three copies will be distributed as follows: Appendix 4B.59

--- Page 311 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Original will be filed in field office. 2 * One copy will be transmitted to the CQA certifying engineer. 3 * One copy will be transmitted to the IDF CM. 4 The CQA certifying engineer will review and initial each summary field report before distributing to the 5 project quality records and the IDF CM. 6 8.1.2 Inspection Data Sheets 7 All observed field and laboratory test data will be recorded on an inspection data sheet. At a minimum, 8 each inspection data sheet will include the following information: 9 * Unique identifying sheet number for cross-referencing and document control. 10 * Description of the inspection activity. 11 * If appropriate, location of inspection activity or location from which the sample was obtained. 12 * Type of inspection activity and/or procedure used (reference to standard method when 13 appropriate). 14 * Any recorded observation or test data, with all necessary calculations. 15 * Results of the inspection activity and comparison with specification requirements. 16 * Identification of any personnel involved in the inspection activity. 17 * Signature of the individual(s) performing the CQA representative activity and concurrence by the 18 CQA certifying engineer. 19 * Identification of deficiencies and any required reinspections. 20 Forms used for the data sheets will be prepared and submitted to the IDF CM and IDF PM in accordance 21 with this section. The data sheets will include, but are not limited to, the forms listed below: 22 * Sample log 23 * Compaction test result log 24 * Soil test result summary form 25 * Equipment calibration log 26 8.1.3 Record Drawing Maintenance 27 The construction general contractor will maintain a complete set of construction drawings labeled 28 "Red-Line" as-built drawings. At the completion of the project, the as-built drawings pertaining to the 29 work certified under this CQA Plan will be produced in electronic format and submitted to the CQA 30 certifying engineer. The CQA certifying engineer will review the completed set of as-built drawings and 31 certify the drawing set as the record drawings for the IDF. 32 8.1.4 Non-Conformance Reporting 33 Deficiencies/defects identified by in-process testing may be reworked in accordance with the technical 34 specifications or CQA Plan to correct the deficiency without initiating the NCR process (i.e., failed 35 compaction test or failed geomembrane destructive test), and in-process tests will be tracked by the CQA 36 representative until it is corrected. A non-conformance is considered to be a deficiency in characteristics, 37 documentation, or procedures that renders the quality of an item or activity unacceptable or indeterminate. 38 All deficiencies, defects, damage, or test failures that are not corrected by in-process rework will be 39 considered a non-conformance and will be documented on a Non-Conformance Report (NCR) form. The 40 non-conformance will be referred to the IDF CM, for disposition and initiation of corrective action 41 processes. 42 All NCR situations will be brought to the attention of the IDF CM for concurrence, prior to initiating the 43 NCR. Appendix 4B.60

--- Page 312 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Upon issuance of the non-conformance report, the IDF CM will notify the IDF design engineer, IDF 2 quality engineer, and IDF PM that the report has issued. Other individuals, as directed by the IDF PM, 3 will participate in NCR disposition, resolution, and corrective action processes as needed. All 4 documentation relating to NCR situations will be retained in the project quality records. 5 8.1.5 Resolution of Contract Document Questions and Clarifications 6 Request for Information (RFI) forms will be provided to the CQA certifying engineer for the purpose of 7 submitting written requests to the IDF CM, for assistance in understanding the design intent of the 8 contract documents. The CM will determine whether the IDF design engineer's technical support staff 9 will address the RF. 10 RFIs initiated by the construction general contractor will be addressed by the IDF project engineer and 11 CM, not by the CQA certifying engineer, and are not in the scope of the CQA Plan. 12 Any RFIs that result in contract document changes will be incorporated by the IDF CM and PM, 13 following the procedures outlined in Section 8.1.6. 14 8.1.6 Construction Change Order and Contract Document Changes 15 Requests for changes to the technical specifications or construction drawings will be referred to the IDF 16 CM and initiated as a change order. All change orders and resulting design changes will be approved by 17 the appropriate project team member prior to implementation, as outlined in procedure HNF-IP-0842, 18 Volume 4., Section 4.29 (Engineering Document Change Control Requirements). Requests for 19 modifications to the CQA Plan will also be made by completing a change order to the IDF CM and 20 procurement agent, with copies to the IDF quality engineer and IDF project engineer. 21 If, during the course of construction, questions arise regarding interpretation of the plans and/or 22 specifications, the IDF CM will be contacted by the CQA certifying engineer. Any clarification of the 23 construction drawings will be documented by a change order, if necessary, or by telephone conversation 24 records or meeting minutes, and routed to the IDF design engineer, IDF CM, and IDF PM. The change 25 order will also be routed to the project files. 26 8.1.7 Progress Reports 27 The CQA certifying engineer will prepare a summary progress report each week, or at time intervals 28 established at the pre-construction meeting. At a minimum, this report will include the following 29 information: 30 * A unique identifying sheet number for cross-referencing and document control. 31 * The date, project name, location, and other information. 32 * A summary of work activities accomplished during the progress reporting period. 33 * Identification of areas or items inspected and/or tested during the reporting period that are 34 addressed by the report. 35 * A summary of the quality characteristics being evaluated, with appropriate cross-references to 36 technical specifications and/or construction drawings. 37 * References to the technical specifications or construction drawings defining the acceptance 38 criteria for each inspected characteristic. 39 * A summary of inspection and test results, failures, and re-tests. 40 * A summary of construction situations, deficiencies, and/or defects occurring during the progress 41 reporting period. 42 * A summary of other problem resolutions and dispositions. 43 * The signature of the CQA certifying engineer. Appendix 4B.61

--- Page 313 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The progress report will be submitted to the IDF PM no more than two days after the last reporting day in 2 the progress report. Copies will also be submitted to the IDF PM, IDF quality engineer, and construction 3 general contractor. 4 8.1.8 Final Documentation and Certification 5 All daily inspection summary reports, inspection sheets, problem identification and corrective measures 6 reports, acceptance reports, change orders, NCRs, photographic records, progress reports, construction 7 drawings, construction drawing revisions, and other pertinent documentation will be retained as 8 permanent project quality records. At the completion of the project, a final CQA report that incorporates 9 all such information, along with as-built drawings, will be prepared by the CQA certifying engineer and 10 submitted to the IDF PM. The CQA certifying engineer will prepare an interim report for construction 11 and testing of the test pads. A final CQA report and certification letter will be completed at the end of the 12 construction that will fulfill the CQA certification requirements specified in WAC 173-303-335(4). 13 The CQA certifying engineer will coordinate the completion of the as-built record drawings that will be 14 generated by a land surveyor licensed in the State of Washington. The as-built records will include scale 15 drawings depicting depths, plan dimensions, elevations, fill thicknesses, and geosynthetic panel layouts. 16 The report will include documentation of each construction component monitored by CQA personnel and 17 will be signed, stamped, and certified by the CQA certifying engineer. 18 8.1.9 Storage of Records 19 During the construction of the IDF, the CQA certifying engineer will be responsible for all CQA 20 documents. This includes the CQA certifying engineer's copy of the design criteria, plans, procedures, 21 and specifications; the CQA Plan; and the originals of all the data sheets and reports. The field records 22 will be kept in lockable, metal cabinets or on metal shelving within a facility, protected by a fire alarm 23 and/or a communication system that provides fire department response and/or fire suppression systems; 24 or, in an Underwriters Laboratory-listed, one-hour fire-rated cabinet. At the completion of the project, all 25 completed documents will be routed to the project quality records. 26 8.1.10 Storage of Archive Construction Material Samples 27 The CQA certifying engineer will be responsible for storing construction material samples collected 28 during the duration of the project. 29 The CQA certifying engineer will coordinate with the IDF PM and IDF CM on which samples will be 30 archived at the completion of the project. All samples will be kept in small containers (i.e., 5-gallon 31 plastic buckets). Each container will be labeled with the following information: 32 * Project name 33 * Date 34 0 Sample I.D. 35 0 Material type 36 * Point of contact 37 Control and protection of samples will be accomplished through the use of an index listing of samples. 38 This index will identify each sample gathered and include the same information required for the sample 39 containers. It will also identify where the sample is stored and person responsible for the sample storage, 40 thus providing a documented record of each sample and methodology for verifying that all samples are 41 available in storage and that no samples have been misplaced. 42 All samples will be stored neatly in a cool, dry location, approved by the CQA certifying engineer. The 43 CQA certifying engineer will coordinate with the IDF PM and IDF CM to determine which sample will 44 be archived at the project completion. 45 Appendix 4B.62

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 4C. FACILITY RESPONSE ACTION PLAN 2 4C.1. Leakage Response Action Plan 3 WAC 173-303-665(9) regulations require the owner of the operator of a landfill unit to have an approved 4 Response Action Plan (RAP) before receipt of waste. The RAP is a site-specific plan that establishes 5 actions to be taken if leakage through the upper (primary) lining system of a landfill exceeds a certain 6 rate. The intent of the RAP is to assure that any leachate that leaks through the primary lining system will 7 not migrate out of the landfill into the environment. 8 A key element of the RAP is the Action Leakage Rate (ALR), a threshold value which triggers the 9 responses described in the RAP, but below which no special actions are required. Because landfill liner 10 systems have not yet been perfected, a small amount of leakage through the primary liner generally 11 occurs, despite the use of best available materials, construction techniques, and quality assurance 12 procedures. (This leakage is collected by the LDS system and removed from the landfill.) Hence, the 13 ALR is set at some level higher than normally expected leakage rates to serve as an indicator that the 14 primary lining system is not functioning as expected. Exceeding the ALR may reflect serious failure of 15 the primary lining system and indicates the need for investigation and possibly corrective action while the 16 problem is still manageable. 17 This RAP has been prepared in accordance with requirements of WAC 173-303-665(9). The 18 requirements for determining the ALR are contained in WAC 173-303-665(8) and the Environmental 19 Protection Agency (EPA) guidance document, Action Leakage Rates for Leak Detection Systems (EPA 20 530-R-92-004). 21 The following sections establish the ALR and discuss response actions to be taken if the ALR is 22 exceeded. 23 4C.1.1. Action Leakage Rate 24 Section 5.11 provides a detailed discussion of the analysis to determine the ALR into the LDS for the 25 Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF). Based on this analyses, the ALR for the IDF permitted cell is 26 206 gallons per acre per day, or approximately 1,800 gallons per day per cell (each cell area is 27 approximately 8.5 acres). This value includes a factor of safety of 2 in accordance with EPA guidelines 28 (57 FR 19). It is also much lower than the LDS pump capacity. Details of the calculation are presented 29 in Appendix C.10. 30 In accordance with WAC 173-303-665(8)(b), the flow rate used to determine if the ALR has been 31 exceeded will be calculated as the average daily flow rate into the sump, expressed as gallons per acre per 32 day (unless Ecology approves a different calculation). This calculation will be performed on a weekly 33 basis during the active (operational) life of the landfill, and monthly after the landfill has been closed. 34 Post-closure frequency may be reduced if only minimal amounts of leachate accumulate in the leak 35 detection system sump. As outlined in WAC 173-303-665(4)(c)(ii), during post-closure monitoring, if 36 the liquid level in the LDS sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive months, 37 monitoring of the amount of liquid in the LDS sumps can be reduced to at least quarterly. If the liquid 38 level in the LDS sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive quarters, monitoring of 39 the amount of liquid in the LDS sumps can be reduced to at least semiannually. Pump operating level is 40 defined as a liquid level approved by Ecology, based on pump activation level, sump dimensions, and 41 level that minimizes head in the sump. 42 4C.1.2. Response Actions 43 WAC 173-303-665(9) lists several required actions if the ALR is exceeded. In the event that the ALR is 44 exceeded, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) will: 45 * Notify Ecology in writing of the exceedance within 7 days of the determination. Appendix 4C.5

--- Page 322 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Submit a preliminary written assessment to Ecology within 14 days of the determination, as to the 2 amount of liquids, likely sources of liquids, possible location, size, cause of any leaks, and short- 3 term actions taken and planned. 4 * Determine, to the extent practicable, the location, size, and cause of any leak. 5 * Determine whether waste receipt should cease or be curtailed, whether any waste should be 6 removed from the unit for inspection, repairs, or controls, and whether or not the unit should be 7 closed. 8 * Determine any other short-term and longer-term actions to be taken to mitigate or stop any leaks. 9 * Within 30 days after the notification that the action leakage rate has been exceeded, submit to 10 Ecology the results of the analyses specified in bullets 3, 4, and 5 of this section, the results of 11 actions taken, and actions planned. Monthly thereafter, as long as the flow rate in the leak 12 detection system exceeds the action leakage rate, the owner or operator must submit to the 13 regional administrator a report summarizing the results of any remedial actions taken and actions 14 planned. 15 If the ALR is exceeded, DOE will submit the required notifications to Ecology, as stated above. The EPA 16 will also receive copies of this confirmation. 17 The leachate will be analyzed for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) constituents. If the 18 analytical results indicate that these constituents are present, and if the constituents can be traced to a 19 particular type of waste stored in a known area of the landfill, then it may be possible to estimate the 20 location of the leak. However, because the waste will meet land disposal restrictions, it will contain no 21 free liquids and will be stabilized or solidified, except as allowed by Appendix 3A, section 1.2. In 22 addition, the canister(s) or other type of waste package(s) may not undergo enough deterioration during 23 the active life of the landfill to permit escape of its contents. For these reasons, it is possible that the 24 leachate may be clean or the composition too general to indicate a specific source location. 25 If the source location cannot be identified, large-scale removal of the waste and operations layer to find 26 and repair the leaking area of the liner would be one option for remediation. However, this procedure 27 risks damaging the liner. In addition, waste would have to be handled, stored, and replaced in the landfill. 28 Backfill would need to be removed from around the waste packages to accomplish this. If the waste 29 packages are damaged during this process, the risk of accidental release may be high. For these reasons, 30 large scale removal of waste and liner system materials is not considered a desirable option and will not 31 be implemented except as a last resort. 32 The preferred options for remediation include covers and changes in landfill operating procedures. The 33 preferred alternative will depend on factors such as the amount of waste already in the landfill, the rate of 34 waste receipt, the chemistry of the leachate, the availability of other RCRA-compliant disposal facilities, 35 and similar considerations. Hence, at this time no single approach can be selected. If the ALR is 36 exceeded, potential options will be evaluated prior to selecting a remediation process. If necessary, an 37 interim solution will be implemented while the evaluation and permanent remediation is performed. 38 Examples of potential approaches include the following: 39 * The surface of the intermediate soil cover over the waste could be graded to direct runoff into a 40 shallow pond. The surface would then be covered with a discardable, temporary geomembrane 41 (e.g., 30-mil PVC or reinforced polypropylene). Precipitation water would be pumped or 42 evaporated from the pond and would not infiltrate the waste already in the landfill. Waste 43 packages would be placed only during periods of dry weather and stored temporarily at other 44 times. This type of approach would also be used, if necessary, to reduce leakage during the time 45 immediately after the ALR was exceeded, while other remediation options were being evaluated. 46 * If the landfill was nearly full, partial construction of the final closure cover might be an option. 47 This would reduce infiltration into the landfill and possibly the leakage rate, if the cover was 48 constructed over the failed area. Appendix 4C.6

--- Page 323 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I * A layer of low-permeability soil could be placed over the existing waste, perhaps in conjunction 2 with a geomembrane, to create a second "primary" liner higher in the landfill. This new liner 3 would intercept precipitation and allow its removal. 4 * A rigid-frame or air-supported structure could be constructed over the landfill to ensure that no 5 infiltration occurred. Although costly, this approach might be less expensive than constructing a 6 new landfill. 7 In general, the selected remediation efforts would be those that are easiest to implement, with more 8 difficult or expensive options to be applied only if earlier approaches were not satisfactory. 9 4C.2.

Two cases are defined: 38 If the geomembrane is fabricated into panels in a factory, a field panel is a factory panel or a portion 39 of factory panel cut in the field. 40 If the geomembrane is not fabricated into factory panels, a field panel is a roll or a portion of roll cut 41 in the field. 42 It will be the responsibility of the CQA Certifying Engineer to assign each field panel an 43 "identification code" (number or letter-number) consistent with the layout plan. This identification 44 code shall be agreed upon by the Construction Manager, Installer, and CQA Certifying Engineer. Appendix 4D.69

--- Page 395 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 This field panel identification code shall be as simple and logical as possible. (Note that roll numbers 2 assigned in the manufacturing plant are usually cumbersome and are not related to location in the 3 field.) 4 The CQA Certifying Engineer will establish a table or chart showing correspondence between roll 5 numbers, factory panels, and field panel identification codes. The field panel identification code shall 6 be used for all quality assurance records, including Installer's quality control (QC) testing. 7 Field Panel Placement: 8 Location: Field panels shall be installed at the locations indicated in the Installer's layout plan, as 9 approved or modified. 10 Installation Schedule: In general seaming of geomembrane will be performed the same day as 11 deployment. However, at the discretion of Geosynthetic Installer, seaming may be carried over to the 12 following workday. 13 Placement Conditions: 14 Geomembrane placement shall not proceed at an ambient temperature below 32 degrees F or above 15 104 degrees F as measured 6 inches above the geomembrane surface unless installation procedures 16 approved by the CQA Certifying Engineer are in place to address environmental conditions. 17 Geomembrane placement shall not be done during any precipitation, in the presence of excessive 18 moisture (e.g., fog, dew), in an area of ponded water, or in the presence of excessive winds. 19 Placement methods shall prevent damage to underlying soil liner or geosynthetic materials. 20 Factors such as expansion, contraction, overlap at seams, anchorage requirements, seaming progress, 21 and drainage shall be considered. Textured-surface sheets shall be aligned in a manner, which 22 maximizes theii frictional capabilities along the slope. Maneuver sheets of geomembrane into place 23 in a manner, which prevents wrinkles, folds, or similar distress, which can damage the geomembrane 24 or prevent its satisfactory alignment or seaming. A smooth-surface HDPE geomembrane rub sheet 25 shall be used when placing textured HDPE geomembrane over underlying GCL. The rub sheet shall 26 be maintained in good condition without tears, rough edges, holes, or scuff marks that can catch, 27 displace, or otherwise disturb the underlying GCL, or the overlying geomembrane. 28 Damage: Damaged panels or portions of damaged panels, which have been rejected, shall be removed 29 from the work area. Any repairs shall be made according to procedures described in this Part of the 30 Specifications. 31 Exposed Geomembrane Protection: After panel deployment, all geomembrane, except those shown as 32 permanently exposed on the Drawings, shall be covered to within a maximum period of 20 working days 33 to minimize exposure to temperature cycles that cause expansion/contraction of the geomembrane and 34 desiccation of the underlying admix liner. Exposure in excess of 15 days, Construction General 35 Contractor will peel back leading panel of geomembrane on a routine basis (established by the CQA 36 inspector) for CQA to inspect for desiccation of admix liner. Any observed desiccation observed outside 37 of specification tolerance will be repaired and the geomembrane covered immediately. Additional 38 exposure areas may be required by CQA to verify complete repair areas required. Geomembrane panels 39 shall be covered by other geosynthetic components of the lining system or overlying soil cover materials 40 as shown on the Drawings. 41 Field Seaming -Polyethylene Geomembranes 42 Seaming Equipment and Products: Approved processes for field seaming are extrusion welding and 43 fusion welding, except that use of extrusion welding shall be limited to areas (such as sumps or repairs) 44 where fusion welding cannot be employed. Proposed alternate processes shall be documented and 45 submitted by the Installer to the Construction Manager and CQA Certifying Engineer for approval. Only 46 equipment, which has been specifically approved by make and model, shall be used. Appendix 4D.70

The 19 fusion-welding machines shall be equipped with gages giving the pertinent temperatures. 20 The Installer shall comply with the following: 21 The Installer shall maintain on site a sufficient number of spare operable seaming machines (at least 22 one at all times) to ensure continuous operations. 23 The equipment used for seaming shall not be likely to damage the geomembrane. 24 The electric generator shall be placed on a smooth base such that no damage occurs to the 25 geomembrane. 26 A smooth insulating plate or fabric shall be placed beneath the hot welding machine after usage. 27 The geomembrane shall be protected from damage in heavily trafficked areas. 28 If a build-up of moisture is observed prior to seaming a movable protective layer shall be used directly 29 below each overlap of geomembrane to be seamed to prevent buildup of moisture between the sheets. 30 Seam Layout: In general, seams shall be oriented parallel to the line of maximum slope, i.e., oriented up 31 and down, not across, the slope to the maximum extent practical. In comers and odd-shaped geometric 32 locations, the number of seams shall be minimized. No seams shall be permitted within the LCRS sump 33 trough for leachate collection and riser pipes. One full panel width shall span the LCRS sump trough. 34 On the landfill floor: 35 No horizontal seam shall be less than 5 feet from the toe of the slope, or other area of potential stress 36 concentrations. 37 Over the LCRS, LDS, and SLDS sump areas in each cell, no horizontal seam shall be placed less than 38 150 feet from the toe of the north slope for a distance of at least 100 feet in each direction from the 39 LCRS and LDS sump centerline. 40 Seams shall be aligned to produce the fewest possible number of wrinkles and "fishmouths". 41 A seam numbering system consistent with the panel numbering system shall be utilized. Appendix 4D.71

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Weather Conditions for Seaming: The allowable weather conditions for seaming are as follows: 2 Unless authorized in writing by the Construction Manager, no seaming shall be attempted at ambient 3 temperatures below 32 degrees F or above 104 degrees F as measured 6 inches above the 4 geomembrane surface. 5 The geomembrane shall be dry, protected from wind, and free of dust. 6 If the Installer wishes to use methods, which may allow seaming at ambient temperatures below 7 32 degrees F, the Installer shall certify in writing that the quality of the seams welded at these 8 temperatures is the same as the quality of seams welded at temperatures above 32 degrees F. In 9 addition, if the Installer wishes to seam at ambient temperatures below 32 degrees F, the following 10 conditions shall be satisfied in addition to the general seaming procedures: 11 For extrusion welding, preheating shall be performed. Preheating may be waived by the Construction 12 Manager if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the CQA Certifying Engineer that welds of 13 equivalent quality may be obtained without preheating at the expected temperature of installation. 14 Sheet grinding, if required, may be performed before preheating. 15 Observe all areas of the geomembrane that have been preheated to determine that they have not been 16 subjected to excessive melting. 17 Confirm that geomembrane surface temperatures have not decreased below the minimum specified 18 for welding, due to wind or other adverse conditions. Wind protection for the seam area may be 19 required. 20 Trial seams, as described in paragraph Trial Seams of this section, shall be made in the immediate 21 area where seaming will occur, under the same ambient temperature and preheating conditions as the 22 actual seams. New trial seams shall be made if the ambient temperature decreases by more than 23 5 degrees F from the previous trial seam conditions. Such new trial seams shall be conducted as soon 24 as seams in progress during the temperature drop have been completed. 25 Additional destructive seam tests, as described in paragraph Destructive Seam Strength Testing of 26 this section, shall be performed at intervals of 250 to 500 feet of seam length at the CQA Certifying 27 Engineer's discretion. 28 The Installer shall provide sample coupons cut from each end of the seam. 29 Seam Preparation: 30 Cleaning: Prior to seaming, the seam area shall be clean and free of moisture, dust, dirt, debris of any 31 kind, and foreign material. Special attention shall be paid to cleaning the existing geomembrane at tie-in 32 locations. 33 Overlap: Cross slope, seams on both the trench floor and sideslopes shall be overlapped so that liquids 34 are not trapped, i.e., seams shall be shingled downslope. If seam overlap grinding is required, the process 35 shall be completed according to the geomembrane manufacturer's instructions within I hour of the 36 seaming operation, and in a way, that does not damage the geomembrane. Panels of geomembrane shall 37 have a finished overlap of a minimum of 3 inches for extrusion welding and 5 inches for fusion welding. 38 Use of Solvents: No solvent or adhesive shall be used. 39 Temporary Bonding: The procedure used to temporarily bond adjacent panels together shall not 40 damage the geomembrane; in particular, the temperature of hot air at the nozzle of any spot welding 41 apparatus shall be controlled such that the geomembrane is not damaged. 42 General Seaming Procedure: The general seaming procedure used by the Installer shall be as follows: 43 Seaming shall extend to the outside edge of panels to be placed in the anchor trench. 44 If required, a firm substrate shall be provided by using a flat board, a conveyor belt, or similar hard 45 surface directly under the seam overlap to achieve proper support. Appendix 4D.72

--- Page 398 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I If seaming operations are carried out at night, adequate illumination shall be provided. 2 "Fishmouths" or wrinkles at the seam overlaps shall be cut along the ridge of the wrinkle in order to 3 achieve a flat overlap. The cut "fishmouths" or wrinkles shall be seamed, and any portion where the 4 overlap is inadequate shall then be patched with an oval or round patch of the same geomembrane 5 extending a minimum of 6 inches beyond the cut in all directions. 6 Construction Quality Control Testing -Polyethylene Geomembranes 7 General: Testing requirements specified herein are intended for the Construction General Contractor 8 (and Geomembrane Installer) during geomembrane installation. Testing requirements for the CQA 9 Certifying Engineer are provided in the CQA Plan. 10 Trial Seams: 11 Trial seams shall be made on fragment pieces of geomembrane liner to verify that seaming conditions 12 are adequate. A trial seam shall be made prior to each seaming period (maximum of 6 hours) for each 13 seaming machine used that day. Also, each seamer shall make at least one trial seam each day. Trial 14 seams shall be made under the same conditions as actual seams. 15 The trial seam sample shall be at least 2 feet long by 1 foot wide (after seaming) with the seam 16 centered lengthwise. Seam overlap shall be as indicated in this Part. 17 Test three specimens for peel and two specimens for shear. Each specimen shall be at least 1 inch 18 wide and shall be cut from the trial seam sample by the Installer. The specimens shall be tested 19 respectively in shear and peel using a field tensiometer, and they shall not fail in the seam. All trial 20 seam specimens must meet the minimum requirements of Table 2, Required Seam Properties, for trial 21 seam acceptance. If a specimen fails, the entire operation shall be repeated. If the additional 22 specimen fails, the seaming apparatus and seamer shall not be accepted and shall not be used for 23 seaming until the deficiencies are corrected and two consecutive successful full trial seams are 24 achieved. 25 All test equipment shall be in calibration and conform to manufacturer's specifications. The Installer 26 shall provide the Construction Manager and CQA Certifying Engineer with current calibration 27 certificates. 28 Nondestructive Seam Continuity Testing: 29 General: 30 The Installer shall nondestructively test all field seams over their full length using a vacuum test unit, 31 air pressure test (for double fusion seams only), or other approved method (i.e., spark test). Vacuum 32 testing and air pressure testing are described below. The purpose of the nondestructive test is to 33 check the continuity of seams. It does not provide any information on seam strength. Continuity 34 testing shall be done as the seaming work progresses. Nondestructive testing will not be permitted 35 before sunrise or after sunset unless the Construction General Contractor demonstrates to the CQA 36 Certifying Engineer their capability to perform testing under reduced light conditions. Any seams, 37 which fail nondestructive testing, shall be repaired in accordance with these Specifications. Seams, 38 which cannot be nondestructively tested because of seam geometry, shall be double welded or 39 capped. 40 All test equipment shall be in calibration and conform to manufacturer's specifications. The Installer 41 shall submit current calibration certificates. 42 Vacuum Testing: The equipment shall be comprised of the following: 43 A vacuum box assembly consisting of a rigid housing, a transparent viewing window, a soft neoprene 44 gasket attached to the bottom, port hole or valve assembly, and a vacuum gage. 45 A steel vacuum tank and pump assembly equipped with a pressure controller and connections. 46 A rubber pressure/vacuum hose with fittings and connections. Appendix 4D.73

--- Page 399 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 A bucket and wide paint brush. 2 A soapy solution. 3 The following procedures shall be used: 4 Energize the vacuum pump and reduce the tank pressure to a minimum of 5 inches of mercury. 5 Wet a strip of geomembrane approximately 12 inches wide by 48 inches long with the soapy solution. 6 Place the vacuum box over the test area. 7 Close the bleed valve and open the vacuum valve. 8 Ensure that a leak tight seal is created. 9 For a period of not less than 10 seconds, examine the geomembrane through the viewing window for 10 the presence of soap bubbles. 11 If no bubbles appear coming from the seam after 10 seconds, close the vacuum valve and open the 12 bleed valve, move the box over the next adjoining area with a minimum 3-inch overlap, and repeat 13 the process. 14 All areas where soap bubbles appear shall be marked and repaired in accordance with this Part. 15 Air Pressure Testing: The following procedures are applicable only to those processes, which produce a 16 double seam with an enclosed air channel. All double seams with an enclosed air channel shall be air 17 pressure tested. The equipment shall be comprised of the following: 18 An air pump (manual or motor driven) capable of generating and sustaining a pressure of 60 to 65 psi. 19 A rubber hose with fittings and connections. 20 A sharp hollow needle, or other approved pressure feed device. 21 A calibrated pressure gage capable of reading pressures up to 65 psi. 22 The following procedures shall be used: 23 Seal both ends of the seam to be tested. 24 Insert needle with pressure gage, or other approved pressure feed device, into the air channel created 25 by the fusion weld. 26 Energize the air pump and pressurize the channel to a minimum 25 psi for a 1/2-inch wide channel, or 27 55 psi for a 1-inch wide channel. Close the valve and sustain the pressure for a minimum of 28 5 minutes. 29 If loss of pressure exceeds 2 psi, or does not stabilize, locate faulty area and repair in accordance with 30 this section. If significant changes in geomembrane temperature occur during the test (e.g., due to 31 cloud cover), the test shall be repeated after the geomembrane temperature has stabilized. 32 Cut end of seam opposite to the pressure gage and observe that the pressure drops. If the pressure 33 does not drop, locate the obstruction(s) in the seam, repair, and retest seam. 34 Remove needle or other approved pressure feed device and repair seam. 35 Destructive Seam Strength Testing: 36 General: 37 Destructive seam tests shall be performed at selected locations. The purpose of these tests is to 38 evaluate seam strength. Seam strength testing shall be done as the seaming work progresses. The 39 samples shall meet the requirements of Table 2, Required Seam Properties. 40 All test equipment shall be in calibration and conform to manufacturer's specifications. The Installer 41 shall submit current calibration certificates. 42 Each sample shall be tested for bonded seam shear and peel strength by an independent testing 43 laboratory. Appendix 4D.74

--- Page 400 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Test at least five specimens for each seam test method (shear and peel). Four out of five specimens 2 must meet the minimum requirements of Table 2, Required Seam Properties, for field seam 3 acceptance. 4 Location and Frequency: 5 Destructive seam samples shall be obtained from actual fabricated field seams as work progresses, not 6 at the completion of field seaming. The CQA Certifying Engineer will select locations where seam 7 samples will be removed. 8 Sampling frequency shall be a minimum of one sample per 500 feet of seam length per welding 9 machine (this minimum frequency shall be determined as an average taken from all the panels, 10 including welds for caps), or a minimum of two samples per factory panel, whichever gives the 11 largest number of samples. If agreed by all parties (Construction General Contractor, Construction 12 Manager, and the CQA Certifying Engineer) the frequency of destructive seam testing may be 13 reduced to one sample per 1,000 feet of seam if test results and other nondestructive seam tests appear 14 adequate for assuring seam quality. If, based on the specified test frequency, a destructive test 15 location should fall within the LCRS or LDS sump area (as shown on the Drawings); the distance 16 between destructive tests shall be reduced to relocate the destructive test location outside the sump 17 area. 18 Sampling Procedures: 19 Samples shall be cut by the Installer as the seaming progresses in order to provide laboratory test 20 results before completion of installation. The CQA Certifying Engineer shall assign a number to each 21 sample, mark it accordingly, and record the sample location on the layout drawing. 22 All holes in the geomembrane resulting from destructive seam sampling shall be immediately 23 repaired in accordance with repair procedures. The continuity of the new seams in the repaired area 24 shall be tested as described in this Part. 25 Sample Size: The samples shall be minimum 12 inches wide by minimum 42 inches long with the seam 26 centered lengthwise. One 1-inch wide strip shall be cut from each end of the samples, and these shall be 27 tested in the field as described below. The remaining sample shall be distributed as follows: 28 One portion (minimum 12 inches by 12 inches) to the Installer for laboratory testing at his discretion. 29 One portion (minimum 12 inches by 12 inches) to the Construction Manager for archive storage. 30 One portion (minimum 12 inches by 18 inches) to the CQA Certifying Engineer for laboratory 31 testing. 32 Field Testing: 33 The two 1-inch wide strips described above shall be tested in the field by tensiometer for peel and 34 shear and shall not fail in the seam. If any test sample fails to pass, then the procedures outlined 35 below (Procedures for Areas Failing Destructive Tests) shall be followed. 36 The CQA Certifying Engineer will mark all samples and portions with its number. The CQA 37 Certifying Engineer will also record the date and time, ambient temperature, number of seaming unit, 38 name of seamer, welding apparatus temperatures and pressures, and pass or fail descriptions, and 39 attach a copy to each sample portion. 40 Procedures for Areas Failing Destructive Tests: The following procedures shall apply whenever a 41 sample fails a destructive test, whether that test is conducted by the independent testing laboratory, the 42 Installer's laboratory, or by field tensiometer. The Installer has two options: 43 The Installer shall cap the seam between any two passing test locations, or 44 The Installer shall trace the seam to two intermediate locations 10 feet minimum from the point of the 45 failed test in each direction and take a small sample for an additional field test at each location. If 46 these additional samples pass the test, then full samples shall be taken for laboratory testing. Appendix 4D.75

--- Page 401 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 If these laboratory samples pass the tests, then the seam shall be capped between these locations. If 2 either sample fails, then the sampling and testing process shall be repeated to establish the zone over 3 which the seam shall be capped. 4 All acceptable capped seams shall be bounded by two locations from which samples passing CQA 5 laboratory destructive tests have been taken. In cases where the length of the capped seam exceeds 6 150 feet, a sample of the capping seam shall be taken and shall pass destructive testing as described in this 7 Part. 8 Repairs -Polyethylene Geomembranes 9 General: 10 Any portion of the geomembrane exhibiting a flaw or failing a destructive or nondestructive test shall 11 be repaired. All repairs shall be conducted in accordance with this Part. All repairs shall be subjected 12 to the nondestructive seam testing procedures described in this Part. 13 Each patch or other type of repair will be numbered and recorded. 14 Repair Procedures: 15 Patching, used to repair large holes, tears, undispersed raw materials, and contamination by foreign 16 matter. 17 Grinding and rewelding, used to repair small sections (typically with a maximum length of no more 18 than several inches) of extruded seams. 19 Spot welding or seaming used to repair pinholes. 20 Capping, used to repair large lengths of failed seams or areas where large wrinkles or fish mouths 21 have been cut to flatten the geomembrane sheet. 22 Topping, used to repair areas of inadequate seams, which have an exposed edge. Topping shall be 23 limited to an aggregate length of no more than 3 m (10 feet) on any given seam. 24 Removing bad seam and replacing with a strip of new material welded into place, used with large 25 lengths of fusion seams. 26 For all repair methods, the following provisions shall be satisfied as applicable: 27 Surfaces of the geomembrane, which are to be repaired, shall be abraded no more than one hour prior 28 to the repair. 29 All surfaces shall be clean and dry at the time of the repair. 30 Patches or caps shall extend at least 6 inches beyond the edge of the defect, and all corners of patches 31 shall be rounded with a radius of at least 3 inches. 32 The geomembrane below large caps shall be appropriately cut to avoid water or gas collection 33 between the two sheets. 34 Verification of Repairs: Each repair shall be numbered and recorded. Each repair shall be 35 nondestructively tested using the methods described in this Part. Large caps may be of sufficient extent to 36 require destructive test sampling. Repairs that fail nondestructive or destructive tests shall be redone and 37 retested until a passing test is obtained. 38 Protection Of Termination Edges 39 Along the south termination of the geomembrane, and along any termination edges of the membrane that 40 may be exposed or buried for extended periods of time prior to their joining to adjacent subsequent 41 sections, the Construction General Contractor shall protect leading edges with protective (sacrificial) 42 layers of cushion geotextile and plywood sheet as shown on the Drawings.

The bentonite percentage 8 and moisture content range may change as a result of preconstruction testing performed on the test pad as 9 described in the CQA Plan, and may be modified by the Construction General Contractor with the 10 approval of the Construction Manager, Engineer, and the CQA Certifying Engineer at any time during the 11 admix processing to reflect changes in the base soil or other components. The moisture content and 12 bentonite dispersion in the admix shall be uniform and homogenous. The finished admix shall be a 13 uniform homogenous material. 14 CQA Testing: The admix shall be prepared by the Construction General Contractor and tested by the 15 CQA Certifying Engineer in accordance with the CQA Plan. The Construction General Contractor shall 16 make the admix stockpiles available to the CQA Certifying Engineer at all times for sampling, testing, or 17 visual observation. 18 Raw Water Supply: See Section 02200, SITE PREPARATION, and the Drawings for information on 19 raw water supply availability and requirements for admix processing and admix liner placement and 20 compaction. 21 Part 3 -Execution 22 Admix Processing 23 Bentonite Use Monitoring: Record weight of bentonite used and volume of admix produced each day. 24 Processing Using Pugmill: 25 The Construction General Contractor shall process and condition admix material using a central type 26 pugmill plant prior to compaction. The pugmill shall have automated controls to continuously control 27 the established proportions of bentonite and water as ratios of the base soil. It shall have provisions to 28 easily change the proportions. It shall be capable of maintaining a constant time of mixing and 29 varying the rate of discharge so that the degree of mixing can be controlled if necessary to achieve 30 complete mixing. 31 The Construction General Contractor shall provide all necessary equipment and labor to operate the 32 pugmill, load material into pugmill, offload admix, and stockpile admix. 33 Equipment: Admix shall be prepared using a pugmill with the following characteristics and ancillary 34 equipment: 35 Continuous mixing pugmill. Blades shall be adjustable for angular position on shafts and shall be 36 reversible to retard flow of mix. 37 Belt scales on base soil, bentonite, and finished product belts. 38 Feed rate meters and totalizers for bentonite, base soil, and water. 39 Production rate meters and totalizers for finished product. 40 Variable speed hydraulic supply water pumps capable of producing 500 tons per hour of admixture. 41 Calibration: 42 After setting up the pugmill, it shall be calibrated to determine the accuracy of the feed rate for each 43 material being mixed. When the feed controls are set at any desired rate, the measured accuracy shall 44 be within 1 percent by weight of the indicated feed rate for the item being mixed. Appendix 4D.84

--- Page 410 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I The accuracy will be determined by operating each feed control separately and collecting and 2 weighing the material over a given period of time as determined by the CQA Certifying Engineer. 3 The material shall be collected in a dump truck (or appropriate container) supplied by the 4 Construction General Contractor, and the truck will be weighed by the Construction General 5 Contractor and verified by the CQA Certifying Engineer before and after loading. During admix 6 production; the CQA Certifying Engineer may request a recalibration of the feed rate for each 7 material as described above. 8 All measuring equipment shall be calibrated and calibration certificates provided to the CQA 9 Certifying Engineer prior to starting admix production. 10 Preparation Requirements: 11 The base soil shall be processed through a pugmill to add bentonite at the specified rate, to add 12 additional water if required, and to provide mechanical mixing action required to homogeneously 13 blend the bentonite and water into the mix. Additional mixing by rotovator or other approved means 14 shall be performed at the Construction General Contractor's sole expense as required to further break 15 down the soil clumps or if additional mixing is needed to achieve a homogenous blend of soil, water, 16 and bentonite. The admix shall be broken down in size sufficiently to result in at least 80 percent of 17 the soil clumps broken down to 1/2 inch in maximum size. Clods are defined as dry hard particles in 18 the admix that cannot be remolded by hand pressure. 19 If mixing is found to be insufficient to produce a thoroughly blended, uniform mixture of base soil 20 and bentonite, or the base soil and bentonite are not being mixed in the specified proportions, the 21 Construction General Contractor shall stop production of admix material. The Construction General 22 Contractor shall not restart production and installation of admix liner until procedures and equipment 23 have been modified so that the specified material is produced. Admix liner that is installed without 24 complete mixing or the correct percentage of bentonite shall be removed and modified by the 25 Construction General Contractor to meet the Specifications. After being modified to meet the 26 Specifications, the material may be reinstalled in the lining. Additional work and delays caused by 27 inadequate or incorrect mixing shall be performed at the Construction General Contractor's sole 28 expense. The Construction General Contractor shall not change the bentonite application rate unless 29 directed to do so by the Engineer in writing. 30 Admix shall be processed and allowed to cure at least 12 hours prior to placement. The Construction 31 General Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining the moisture content of the admix within the 32 specified limits. Admix that does not meet Specifications shall not be reused as feed stock unless 33 approved by the Engineer and CQA Certifying Engineer. 34 Test Pad(s) 35 Test pads for the admix liner shall be constructed as specified in Article ADMIX LINER 36 PLACEMENT AND COMPACTION, by the Construction General Contractor to determine 37 acceptable placement and compaction methods to produce a low-permeability admix liner that 38 satisfies the requirements of this section. Both a horizontal and sideslope test pad shall be 39 constructed. The location of the test pads will be designated by the Construction Manager and the 40 CQA Certifying Engineer. 41 Test Pad Material: The Construction General Contractor will prepare a sufficient quantity of soil for the 42 test pad in accordance with the requirements of Article ADMIX LINER MATERIAL. All specified 43 procedures for mixing, conditioning, and stockpiling of the soil material will be followed. 44 Horizontal Test Pad Construction: 45 The test pad will be constructed on a horizontal surface within the limits of the IDF in an area 46 representative of conditions beneath the waste disposal cells. The pad will be located in a well-drained 47 area to prevent surface water intrusion or saturation of the test pad soils. Appendix 4D.85

--- Page 411 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The test pad location will be cleared and grubbed, and the subgrade will be compacted in the same 2 manner anticipated for construction beneath the waste disposal cells. Prior to placement of the test pad 3 materials, the Contractor's Site Superintendent and the CQA Certifying Engineer will evaluate the 4 condition of the subgrade; areas containing potentially unsuitable materials will be replaced, or another 5 location will be selected for the test pad. 6 So that the test pad will accurately represent the performance of the full-scale facility, the following 7 guidelines will be followed: 8 Construction of the test pad will use the same soil materials, design specifications, equipment, and 9 procedures as proposed for the full-scale facility. 10 The test pad will be constructed at least four times wider than the construction compactor drum width 11 to be used for the full-scale facility and allow for installation of field permeability testing per method 12 ASTM D6391 or 50 feet minimum (whichever is greater). This is required to ensure a sufficient 13 representative area for testing, avoiding the edges of the test pad. The test pad may be subdivided 14 into "lanes" to facilitate evaluation of different compaction methods; however, the width of any 15 individual lane shall be no less than twice the width of the construction compactor drum equipment. 16 The test pad will be long enough to allow construction equipment to achieve normal operating speed 17 before reaching the area that will be used for testing or 80 feet minimum (whichever is greater). 18 The test pad will be constructed with at least six lifts to evaluate the methodology used to tie lifts 19 together. Lift thickness will be as described in Article ADMIX PLACEMENT AND 20 COMPACTION, and the total thickness of the test pad will be at least 3 feet. 21 The test pad constructed will include the removal and replacement of a portion of the soil to evaluate 22 the method proposed for repairing defective portions of the full-scale liner as specified in Article 23 REPAIR OF ADMIX LINER. 24 Sideslope Test Pad Construction: 25 The sideslope test pad will be constructed on a 3H: 1V sideslope (within the lined area of Phase 1) to 26 evaluate compaction methods and performance on the sideslope. Field permeability testing is not 27 required for sideslope test pad. Sideslope test pad will be used to demonstrate that compaction and 28 placement methods to achieve acceptable moisture and density requirements can be achieved. 29 So that the test pad will accurately represent the performance of the full-scale facility, the following 30 guidelines will be followed: 31 Construction of the test pad will use the same soil materials, design specifications, equipment, and 32 procedures as proposed for the full-scale facility. 33 The test pad will be constructed at least four times wider than the widest piece of construction 34 equipment to be used for the full-scale facility or 40 feet minimum (whichever is greater). This is 35 required to ensure a sufficient representative area for testing, avoiding the edges of the test pad. The 36 test pad may be subdivided into "lanes" to facilitate evaluation of different compaction methods; 37 however, the width of any individual lane shall be no less than twice the width of the widest piece of 38 construction equipment. 39 The test pad will be long enough to allow construction equipment to achieve normal operating speed 40 before reaching the area that will be used for testing or 80 feet minimum (whichever is greater). 41 The test pad will be constructed with at least six lifts to evaluate the methodology used to tie lifts 42 together. Lift thickness will be as described in Article SOIL BENTONITE PLACEMENT AND 43 COMPACTION, and the total thickness of the test pad will be at least 3 feet. 44 Demonstrate the Following During Test Pad(s) Construction: 45 Base soil/bentonite mixing process prior to compaction. 46 Compaction equipment type, configuration, and weight.

These holes shall be used for the purpose of 13 demonstrating repair methods as specified herein. 14 No admix liner shall be placed until the associated test pad has been constructed and the results from 15 all test methods indicate that the admix liner will satisfy the permeability requirements specified in 16 this section. Testing for each test pad shall be as described in the CQA Plan. At the completion of 17 the test pad(s), the CQA Certifying Engineer, as described in the CQA Plan, will prepare an interim 18 report with recommendations for compaction and placement methods to be applied to the full-scale 19 admix liner construction. 20 After all testing has been completed and approved, the material in the test pad can be used by the 21 Construction General Contractor for liner construction provided that the material satisfies the 22 requirements of these Specifications. 23 Subqrade Preparation 24 As specified in Section 02319, SUBGRADE PREPARATION, Article PREPARED SUBGRADE FOR 25 ADMIX LINER. 26 Admix Liner Placement and Compaction 27 Lift Thickness: Admix liner material, as specified in Article ADMIX LINER MATERIAL, shall be 28 placed in loose lifts, and compacted such that the compacted lift thickness is 6 inches or less (within a 29 tolerance of 0.1 foot). However, the first lift of admix liner placed over subgrade soils may be placed and 30 compacted to a maximum thickness of 8 inches (within a tolerance of 0.1 foot). 31 Placement methods shall prevent excessive mixing of admix liner with subgrade soil. 32 Compaction: The intent of this Specification is that admix liner shall be produced to meet an in-place 33 performance specification of less than 1x10 -'cm/sec hydraulic conductivity within the limits of edge of 34 liner shown on the Drawings. See paragraph Outside Edge of Liner in this Article for compaction and 35 hydraulic conductivity requirements beyond edge of liner. The Construction General Contractor is 36 responsible to develop and use compaction methods that produce the required relative compaction. 37 The moisture-density ranges of the compacted admix shall lie within a trapezoidal-shaped field with the 38 following corners: Moisture Content (%) Dry Density (pcf) 8 126 12 110 14 126 19 110 Appendix 4D.87

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Hydraulic Conductivity: The in-place compacted admix liner shall achieve a saturated hydraulic 2 conductivity as listed below: 3 All field (in-situ) test results shall be I x 10-7 cm/sec or less. Field (in-situ) hydraulic conductivity 4 tests will be performed only on admix liner of the horizontal test pad. 5 All hydraulic conductivity during admix production placement will be verified on undisturbed Shelby 6 tube samples (see ASTM D1587) obtained from in-place admix liner per the CQA plan and then 7 tested in laboratory using methods as described in ASTM D5084. 8 Hydraulic conductivity will be verified on undisturbed samples from completed areas of the liner as 9 described in the CQA Plan. The arithmetic average of laboratory test results on undisturbed Shelby 10 tube samples shall be less than or equal to 5 x 10-8 cm/sec, with no individual test result exceeding 1 x 11 10-7cm/sec. The acceptable values for laboratory test results will be verified or adjusted prior to 12 admix liner production placement based on the correlation of field and laboratory hydraulic 13 conductivity test results from the horizontal test pad. The final laboratory hydraulic conductivity 14 requirement will be approved by the CQA Certifying Engineer and documented in the horizontal test 15 pad report. 16 Outside Edge of Liner: Compact admix liner as specified herein. Performance specification for admix 17 hydraulic conductivity do not apply to admix placed beyond edge of liner. 18 Uniformity: The compacted soil distribution and gradation throughout the liner shall be free from lenses, 19 pockets, streaks, layers, or material differing substantially in texture, moisture content, dry density, or 20 gradation from surrounding material. The admix liner material shall be free of organic debris, frozen 21 material, rubbish, construction debris, and other deleterious material. Any soil containing unacceptable 22 material shall be removed and discarded in the permanent stockpile, placed in accordance with 23 Section 02315, FILL AND BACKFILL. 24 Moisture Conditioning: 25 The moisture content of the admix liner shall be uniform throughout each lift prior to and during 26 compaction of the material. If the moisture content of a lift of compacted admix liner falls below the 27 acceptable limit during placement operations, the Construction General Contractor shall moisture 28 condition the dry soil and re-compact the lift prior to placement of additional lifts. If the moisture 29 content of a lift of compacted soil exceeds the acceptable limit due to precipitation or over watering, 30 the Construction General Contractor, before placement of additional lifts, shall either allow the wet 31 soil to dry back or remove the wet soil. If the admix liner material cannot be conditioned to meet the 32 placement specifications, the material shall be removed and replaced with new admix liner. 33 When the final lift of admix liner placement will be interrupted for more than a few hours or when 34 precipitation is imminent, as determined by the Contractor's Site Superintendent, the lift surface shall 35 be sealed with a smooth drum roller to prevent excessive moisture infiltration. This surface shall be 36 scarified with a rotovator, or other equivalent equipment, immediately prior to resuming soil 37 placement. The Construction General Contractor shall verify that existing moisture content is within 38 the range specified in Article ADMIX LINER PLACEMENT AND COMPACTION, prior to 39 resumption of soil placement activities. 40 Placement Equipment: The Construction General Contractor shall place layers of the admix liner to 41 form a continuous monolithic material. All admix liner shall be placed and compacted with a self- 42 propelled pegfoot or padfoot roller compactor having a minimum operating weight of 68,000 pounds. 43 Smaller compaction equipment may be used in limited areas as necessary provided that the required 44 moisture/density, lift bonding, and hydraulic conductivity can be achieved. Hydraulic conductivity 45 performance specification for the admix liner will be verified in areas where the lighter equipment is 46 used. Hauling and spreading equipment will not be considered as compaction equipment. The compactor 47 feet shall be sufficiently long to knead (bond) new lifts into previously placed lifts. Appendix 4D.88

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The feet shall be kept free of large amounts of dried soil that might restrict foot penetration or become 2 incorporated into the soil lift. The top of each lift may be scarified with a rotovator, or other equivalent 3 equipment or procedures, prior to placing the subsequent lift. The final lift of admix liner may be 4 compacted with a smooth drum roller provided that all other requirements are met. 5 Provide a smooth soil surface on the final lift prior to placement of the HDPE geomembrane as specified 6 in Article SURFACE FINISHING. 7 Tie-in Areas: Where new admix liner is tied in to existing admix of a previous day's placement, any 8 areas of the existing admix which are soft, cracked, or otherwise unsuitable shall be removed until 9 acceptable material is exposed. Where new admix will be placed, the surface of the existing admix liner 10 shall be scarified and moisture conditioned as described in this section. New admix liner shall be placed 11 in accordance with the requirements of this section and shall be thoroughly kneaded into the existing 12 admix liner to form a monolithic mass free of seams or other discontinuities. 13 Placement Method: Admix liner may be placed on the sideslopes in either horizontal lifts (along the 14 contour) or in lifts parallel to the slope (up and down the slope). If admix liner is placed parallel to the 15 slope, compaction equipment shall not spin their wheels or in any other way disturb the previously placed 16 lifts. If this occurs, the Construction General Contractor shall place all of the admix liner in horizontal 17 lifts. 18 Restrictions: Production, mixing, and stockpiling of admix or native clay soil shall be restricted to the 19 area shown on the Drawings or within the Phase I footprint as approved by the Construction Manager. 20 Surface Finishing 21 The surface of the admix liner shall be trimmed to the design grades and tolerances as shown on the 22 Drawings. The surface of the admix liner shall be rolled with a smooth-drum roller to remove all 23 ridges and surface irregularities as specified in Section 02319, SUBGRADE PREPARATION. All 24 wheel ruts in excess of depths specified in Section 02319, SUBGRADE PREPARATION, on the 25 surface of the admix liner shall be repaired by the Construction General Contractor prior to placement 26 of the geomembrane. Acceptable methods for repair of the admix liner are specified in Article 27 REPAIR OF ADMIX LINER. 28 Maintenance 29 The Construction General Contractor shall maintain the admix liner surface in a condition suitable for 30 geomembrane installation until the surface is covered. The admix liner shall be protected from 31 desiccation or excessive moisture. This may be accomplished by periodic watering, exclusion of 32 traffic, placement of a temporary removable plastic cover, or other methods. Desiccation cracks 33 larger than 1 inch deep or 0.25 inch wide shall be excavated to the full depth of the crack and repaired 34 as specified in Article REPAIR OF ADMIX LINER. In the event that the geomembrane cannot be 35 installed within 12 hours after placement of the final admix liner lift, the final lift of admix liner shall 36 be constructed 4 to 6 inches thicker than required and cut to finish grade immediately before 37 geomembrane deployment. 38 The Construction General Contractor shall take measures to prevent the admix liner from freezing. 39 Lifts of admix liner shall not be placed on frozen surfaces. Geomembrane shall not be placed on a 40 surface, which is frozen or has been frozen and thawed until directed by the Construction Manager 41 and the CQA Certifying Engineer. 42 Repair of Admix Liner 43 The Construction General Contractor shall repair the surface of any areas identified to be out of 44 tolerance.

Manual Management Directive Revision TFC-MD-034, REV A GRAPHIC PROCESS DISPLAY of 3 CRITERIA FOR HUMAN-MACHINE Issue Date January 9,2004 INTERFACES Effective Date January 12, 2004 Expiration Date March 1, 2004 FUNCTIONAL AREA MANAGER: D. C. Lowe DOCUMENT OWNER: R. E. Larson 3 1.0 PURPOSE AND SCOPE 4 The purpose of this management directive (MD) is to establish the requirements for standardized criteria 5 for new graphic process displays (human-machine interfaces) that are being designed or acquired for 6 process monitoring and control systems of CH2M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. (CH2M HILL) facilities 7 and managed projects. 8 The requirements of this MD are applicable to new monitoring and control system designs (Human- 9 Machine Interfaces) for CH2M facilities and to projects that have not completed an Acceptance Test 10 Procedure (ATP). Application of the MD requirements to existing human-machine interfaces systems 11 and human-machine interfaces systems with a completed ATP will be determined, planned, and 12 performed in accordance with the resolution of PER-2003-4039. 13 2.0 IMPLEMENTATION 14 This management directive is effective on the date shown in the header and will remain in effect until a 15 new Graphic Process Display Criteria for Human-Machine Interface Standard is issued. 16 3.0 DIRECTIVE 17 The following requirements that are based on the national standard ISA-S5.5-1985, "Graphic Symbols for 18 Process Displays," are the Tank Farm Contractors (TFC) design requirement for new process monitoring 19 and control systems (Human-Machine Interfaces). 20 3.1 General 21 The following general symbol usage standards apply: 22 1. The graphic process display will follow requirements specified in ISA-S5.5 standard. 23 2. The use of outline and solid (filled) symbol forms to indicate status is as follows: 24 * An outline symbol form indicates an off, stopped, or nonactive state. 25 * A solid (filled) symbol form indicates an on, running, or active state. 26 * Status designation by use of solid or outline forms are particularly applicable to the rotating 27 equipment and valves and actuators. In depicting valve position, use solid to show open 28 (material flowing or active) and outline to show closed (material stopped or nonactive). 29 * A symbol may be partially filled or shaded to represent the characteristic of the contents of a 30 vessel, e.g. level, temperature, etc. Appendix 4D.260

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Single butt fusion welds shall be used to create pipe sections as long as practicable. Fabricated pipe 2 sections and fittings may be joined by the double butt fusion process. 3 During installation, the pipe shall not be pulled across sharp projections that could cause gouges, 4 kinks, or other types of damage. To minimize "snaking" due to thermal expansion, protect pipe from 5 direct sunlight, or limit unrestrained length of pipe during installation. 6 Allowance for Thermal Expansion/Contraction: 7 HDPE has a coefficient of thermal expansion of 1.2 x 10-4 ft/ft/deg F. Buried HDPE pipe shall be 8 installed with excess length between anchor points such that contraction caused by temperature drop to 9 40 degrees F will produce the length of pipe between two points shown on the Drawings. Amount of 10 excess pipe depends on temperatures of pipe at the time of installation, according to Table I for buried 11 piping: 12 TABLE 1 Installation Temperature (degrees F) Excess Pipe Length (in./100 ft) 50 1.4 60 2.9 70 4.3 80 5.8 90 7.2 100 8.6 120 11.5 13 Installation temperature is of the pipe material and not ambient air temperature. Measure installation 14 temperature with a strip thermometer laid directly on the pipe. Verify temperate and excess pipe length 15 required immediately before burial. 16 Placement of Buried Pipes: 17 Excavate trench bottom and sides of ample dimensions to permit visual inspection and testing of 18 entire flange, valve, or connection. 19 The pipe shall not be dropped into the trench. Exercise care when lowering pipe into trench to 20 prevent twisting or damage to pipe. The full length of the pipe shall be firmly bedded on the trench 21 bottom. 22 The pipe shall be bedded in such a way as to maintain grade with a tolerance of -0.0 percent, 23 +0.5 percent with a uniform, constant grade and no localized low spots. 24 Pipe Base and Pipe Zone: 25 As specified in Section 02320, TRENCH BACKFILL. 26 Keep trench dry until pipe laying and joining are completed. 27 Prevent foreign material from entering pipe during placement. 28 Close and block open end of last laid pipe section when placement operations are not in progress and 29 at close of day's work. 30 Install closure sections and adapters for gravity piping at locations where pipe laying changes 31 direction. 32 After joint has been made, check pipe alignment and grade. Appendix 4D.272

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Place sufficient pipe zone material to secure pipe from movement before next joint is installed. 2 Prevent uplift and floating of pipe prior to backfilling. 3 Place pipe along pipe runs starting at one end and moving towards the other to avoid joints that will not 4 be feasible with butt fusion. 5 Tolerances: Horizontal position of pipe centerline on alignment around curves maximum variation of 6 1.0 foot from position shown. 7 Pipe Cover: 8 Minimum 2 feet 6 inches from finished elevation of overlying material, unless otherwise shown. 9 Temporarily close pipe ends as required to avoid introducing dirt or other foreign material into the pipe. 10 Trenching and backfilling operations shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of 11 Section 02320, TRENCH BACKFILL, for utility trenching. If trenching is used, underlying materials 12 shall not be disturbed or damaged in anyway. Backfilling operations shall ensure that no voids are 13 present under or at the sides of the pipe. Backfill shall initially be placed to the top of the pipe, then hand 14 compacted. The remainder of the trench shall then be backfilled and compacted by hand or with a power 15 tamper only. 16 On the floor of the cell, pipe may be placed directly on geosynthetic layers prior to placing drainage 17 gravel. Placement of gravel around pipes shall be by hand unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. 18 Placement operations shall ensure that no voids are present under or at the sides of the pipe. Placement 19 operations shall not disturb the position of the pipe. 20 Where flanged joints are used, the bolts shall be evenly torqued using a crossing pattern to gradually 21 tighten the lug nuts. Torque values shall be as recommended by the flange manufacturer. Flanged joints 22 shall be retorqued after one hour or more has passed. Apply anti-seize compound on all threaded surfaces 23 before tightening. 24 Flaws (minor imperfections, damaged areas, etc.) in HDPE pipe with a depth of 10 percent or less of the 25 nominal wall thickness will not require repair or replacement. In double containment systems, carrier 26 pipe with flaws deeper than 10 percent of the wall thickness shall be replaced. Single pipe or containment 27 pipe with flaws between 10 and 25 percent of the wall thickness shall be repaired in accordance with the 28 pipe manufacturer's recommendations. The Construction General Contractor shall certify in writing that 29 the repaired area will have material properties that meet or exceed those of intact pipe. Any pipe with 30 flaws deeper than 25 percent of the nominal wall thickness shall be rejected. 31 All valves and equipment shall be supported independently from pipe. Anchor valves such that turning 32 moment resulting from their operation will not be transmitted to pipe. 33 Special Precautions at Flanges: Polyethylene pipe connected to heavy fittings, manholes, and rigid 34 structures shall be supported in such a manner that no subsequent relative movement between 35 polyethylene pipe at flanged joint and rigid structures is possible. 36 Butt-fusion shall be performed in accordance with pipe manufacturer's recommendations as to equipment 37 and technique. 38 Weld Beads: Remove internal weld beads from the side slope risers and horizontal sections of slotted 39 pipe where the LCRS and LDS pumps will be placed and the horizontal and vertical sections of the LCRS 40 level transducer pipe. Remove all plastic debris from inside pipe. 41 Slotted Pipe: Slotted pipe shall be cut and joined so that full contact is made around the entire 42 circumference of the weld. Partial weld contact because ofjoints through a slot row is not acceptable. 43 Locator Ribbon 44 Locator ribbon shall be installed as specified in Section 02320, TRENCH BACKFILL. Appendix 4D.273

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 5.0 GROUNDWATER MONITORING 2 The Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF) will be an Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 3 (RCRA)-compliant landfill (i.e., a double lined trench with leachate collection system). This chapter 4 describes the groundwater monitoring plan for the IDF and addresses the requirements of RCRA, as 5 described in 40 CFR 264, Subpart F, by reference of WAC 173-303-645(3). Figure 5.1 shows the 6 location of the IDF and surrounding groundwater wells in the 200 East Area. This chapter is designed to 7 meet final status detection-level groundwater monitoring requirements for the IDF. This groundwater 8 monitoring plan is based on the application of a modified data quality objectives (EPA QA/G-4) process 9 to a conceptual model, and the most recent evaluations of groundwater hydrology and chemistry at the 10 site. 11 This plan describes the characteristics of the waste to be disposed in the IDF and the site geology and 12 hydrology used to design and operate the monitoring well network and to interpret the groundwater data. 13 The historic groundwater chemistry from wells near the IDF site is provided. Much of the information 14 pertaining to waste characterization is taken from HNF-4921 and that pertaining to hydrogeology from 15 PNNL-1 1957, PNNL-12257, PNNL-13652, and PNNL-14029. 16 The plan includes a description of network well locations, well construction, sample constituents, and 17 sampling frequency for detection-level groundwater monitoring. Procedures for determination of 18 compliance point groundwater quality also are included. Finally, this plan provides the basis for rapid 19 development of a compliance monitoring plan if a validated exceedance of an indicator parameter is 20 found. This plan controls initial baseline monitoring and subsequent detection level monitoring only for 21 the IDF. 22 Source, special nuclear, and byproduct materials as defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 23 amended, are regulated at the United States Department of Energy (DOE) facilities exclusively by DOE 24 acting pursuant to its AEA authority. These materials are not subject to regulation by the State of 25 Washington. All information contained herein and related to, or describing AEA-regulated materials and 26 processes in any manner may not be used to create conditions or other restrictions set forth in any permit, 27 license, order, or any other enforceable instrument. DOE asserts that pursuant to the AEA, it has sole and 28 exclusive responsibility and authority to regulate source, special nuclear and by-product materials at 29 DOE-owned nuclear facilities.

Interim status groundwater monitoring is 35 not applicable. 36 5.3 Aquifer Identification 37 The following sections discuss geology and hydrology. 38 5.3.1 Geology of the IDF Site 39 The 200 East Area lies on the Cold Creek bar, a geomorphic remnant of the cataclysmic, glacial related 40 floods of the Pleistocene Epoch. As the floodwaters raced across the lowlands of the Pasco Basin and 41 Hanford Site, floodwaters lost energy and began to deposit sand and gravel. The 200 Area Plateau is one 42 of the most prominent deposits. The 200 Area Plateau lies just southwest of one of the major flood 43 channels across the Hanford Site that forms the topographic lowland south of Gable Mountain. 44 Borehole data provide the principal source of geologic, hydrologic, and groundwater information for the 45 200 East Area and the IDF site. 46 Chapter 5.5

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Numerous boreholes (both vadose zone boreholes and groundwater monitoring wells) have been drilled in 2 the 200 East Area for groundwater monitoring and waste management studies (Figure 5.1 shows the 3 location of groundwater wells near the IDF site.) However, data are limited within the IDF site primarily 4 because no previous construction or waste disposal activities have occurred in this part of the Hanford 5 Facility. Most boreholes in the 200 East Area have been drilled using the cable tool method and either a 6 hard tool or drive barrel to advance the hole. Some boreholes have been drilled by rotary and wire line 7 coring methods. More recently, boreholes in the area have been drilled, and in five cases cored, by 8 percussion hammer methods. Geologic logs are based on examination of drill core, chips, and cuttings 9 from these boreholes. Chip samples typically are taken at 1.5-meter intervals and routinely archived at 10 the Hanford Geotechnical Sample Library. 11 5.3.1.1 Structural Framework 12 The IDF site will be located south of the Gable Mountain segment of the Umtanum Ridge anticline and 13 about 3 kilometers north of the axis of the Cold Creek syncline, which controls the structural grain of the 14 basalt bedrock and the Ringold Formation. The basalt surface and Ringold Formation trend roughly 15 southeast-northwest parallel to the major geologic structures of the site. As a result, the Ringold 16 Formation and the underlying Columbia River Basalt Group gently dip to the south off the Umtanum 17 Ridge anticline into the Cold Creek syncline. 18 Geologic mapping on the Hanford Site and examination of drill core and borehole cuttings in the area 19 have not identified any faults in the vicinity of the IDF site (DOE/RW-0164). The closest known faults 20 are along the Umtanum Ridge-Gable Mountain structure north of the disposal site and the May Junction 21 fault east of the site (Figure 5.2). 22 5.3.1.2 Stratigraphy 23 The basalt and post-basalt stratigraphy for the IDF site is shown in Figure 5.3. Approximately 137 to 167 24 meters of suprabasalt sediments overlie the basalt bedrock at the site. 25 Basalt Bedrock. Previous studies (RHO-BWI-ST-14; Reidel and Fecht 1994) have shown that the 26 youngest lava flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group at the 200 East Area are those of the 27 10.5 million year old Elephant Mountain Member. This member underlies the entire 200 East Area and 28 surrounding area and forms the base of the suprabasalts aquifer. No erosional windows in the basalt are 29 known or suspected to occur in the area of the IDF site. 30 Ringold Formation. Few boreholes penetrate the entire Ringold Formation at the IDF site so available 31 data are limited. The Ringold Formation reaches a maximum thickness of 95 meters on the west side of 32 the site and thins eastward. The member of Wooded Island (Figure 5.3) is the only member of the 33 Ringold Formation in the 200 East Area. The deepest Ringold Formation unit encountered is the lower 34 gravel, unit A. Lying above unit A is the lower mud unit and overlying the lower mud unit is upper 35 gravel, unit E. The sand and silt units of the members of Taylor Flat and Savage Island of the Ringold 36 Formation are not present at the IDF site. Unit A and unit E are equivalent to the Pliocene-Miocene 37 continental conglomerates (Reidel and Fecht 1994). The lower mud unit is equivalent to the 38 Pliocene-Miocene continental sand, silt, and clay beds (Reidel and Fecht 1994). 39 Only three boreholes have penetrated unit A in the area of the IDF site. Unit A is 19 meters thick on the 40 west side of the site and thins to the northeast. Unit A is partly to well cemented conglomerate consisting 41 of both felsic and basaltic clasts in a sandy matrix and is interpreted as a fluvial gravel facies 42 (Lindsey 1996). There are minor beds of yellow to white interbedded sand and silt. Green colored, 43 reduced-iron stain is present on some grains and pebbles. Although the entire unit appears to be 44 cemented, the zone produced abundant high quality water in borehole 299-E17-21 (PNNL-1 1957). 45 Nineteen meters of the lower mud unit were encountered in one borehole at the IDF site (PNNL-1 1957). 46 The upper most 1-meter or so consists of a yellow mud to sandy mud. The yellow mud grades downward 47 into about 10 meters of blue mud. 48 Chapter 5.6

--- Page 708 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The blue mud, in turn, grades down into 7 meters of brown mud with organic rich zones and occasional 2 wood fragments. The lower mud unit is absent in the center of the site (northeast of borehole 299-E24-7 3 on Figure 5.4). 4 Unit E is described as a sandy gravel to gravelly sand. Unit E is interpreted to consist of as much as 5 15 meters of conglomerate with scattered large pebbles and cobbles up to 25 centimeters in size in a 6 sandy matrix. The gravel consists of both felsic and basaltic rocks that are well rounded with a sand 7 matrix supporting the cobbles and pebbles. Cementation of this unit ranges from slight to moderate. 8 The upper contact of unit E is not identified easily at the IDF site. In the western part of the study area, 9 unconsolidated gravels of the Hanford formation directly overly the Ringold Formation unit E gravels, 10 making exact placement of the contact difficult. The dominance of basalt and the absence of cementation 11 in the Hanford formation are the key criteria used to distinguishing these (PNNL-1 1957). In the central 12 and northeast part of the area, unit E has been eroded completely. Unconsolidated gravels and sands 13 typical of the Hanford formation replace unit E. 14 Unconformity at the Top of the Ringold Formation. The surface of the Ringold Formation is irregular 15 in the area of the IDF site. A northwest-southeast trending erosional channel or trough (the Columbia 16 River/Missoula flood channel) is centered through the northeast portion of the site. The trough is deepest 17 near borehole 299-E24-21 in the northern part of the site (PNNL-13652). This trough is interpreted as 18 part of a larger trough under the 200 East Area resulting from scouring by the Missoula floods. Borehole 19 299-E17-21, located at the southwest corner of the IDF site, is at the west side of the channel where 20 approximately 46 meters of Ringold Formation have been removed and replaced by Hanford formation 21 gravels. Boreholes 299-E17-25 and 299-E17-23, located along the southeastern edge of the Site, are near 22 the deepest portion of the channel where it is interpreted that almost all of the Ringold Formation has 23 been eroded. At this location, the water table in the channel is interpreted to be 52 meters above the 24 basalt, which forms the floor of the channel. The surface of basalt rises to the north where the water table 25 is approximately 27 meters above the basalt at the northeast corner of the site near borehole 299-E24-21. 26 Hanford formation. The Hanford formation is as much as 116 meters thick in and around the IDF site. 27 The Hanford formation thickens in the erosional channel cut into the Ringold Formation and thins to the 28 southwest along the margin of the channel. 29 At the IDF site, the Hanford formation consists mainly of sand dominated facies with lesser amounts of 30 silt dominated and gravel dominated facies. The Hanford formation has been described as poorly sorted 31 pebble to boulder gravel and fine- to coarse-grained sand, with lesser amounts of interstitial and 32 interbedded silt and clay. In previous studies of the site (WHC-MR-0391), the Hanford formation was 33 described as consisting of three units: an upper and lower gravel facies and a sand facies between the two 34 gravelly units. The upper gravel dominated facies appears to be thin or absent in the immediate area of 35 the IDF site (PNNL-12257, PNNL-13652, and PNNL-14029). 36 The lowermost part of the Hanford formation encountered in boreholes at the IDF site consists of the 37 gravel-dominated facies. Drill core and cuttings from boreholes 299-E17-21, 299-E17-22, 299-E17-23, 38 299-E17-25, and 299-E24-21 indicate that the unit is a clast-supported pebble- to cobble gravel with 39 minor amounts of sand in the matrix. The cobbles and pebbles almost are exclusively basalt with no 40 cementation. This unit pinches out west of the IDF site and thickens to the east and northeast 41 (Figure 5.4). The water table beneath the IDF site is located in the lower gravel unit. The lower gravel 42 unit is interpreted to be Missoula flood gravels deposited in the erosional channel carved into the 43 underlying Ringold Formation. 44 The upper portion of the Hanford formation consists of at least 73 meters of fine- to coarse-grained sand 45 with minor amounts of silt and clay and some gravelly sands. 46 Holocene Deposits. Holocene, eolian deposits cover the southern part of the IDF site. Caliche coatings 47 on the bottom of pebbles and cobbles in drill cores through this unit are typical of Holocene caliche 48 development in the Columbia Basin. Chapter 5.7

--- Page 709 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I The southern part of the IDF site is capped by a stabilized sand dune. The eolian unit is composed of 2 fine- to coarse-grained sands with abundant silt, as layers and as material mixed with the sand. 3 Clastic Dikes. A clastic dike was encountered in borehole C3828, adjacent to well 299-E17-25, at the 4 IDF site. Clastic dikes also have been observed in excavations surrounding the site [e.g., US Ecology, the 5 former Grout area, the 216-BC cribs, the Central Landfill, and the Environmental Restoration Disposal 6 Facility (BHI-01103)]. In undisturbed areas, such as the IDF site, clastic dikes typically are not observed 7 because these are covered by windblown sediments. The occurrence of a clastic dike in borehole C3828 8 suggests that these probably are present elsewhere in the subsurface at the disposal site. The IDF 9 excavation will be geologically mapped to document the occurrence of any clastic dikes that may exist at 10 the site. 11 5.3.2 Groundwater Hydrology 12 The unconfined aquifer under the IDF site occurs in the fluvial gravels of the Ringold Formation and 13 flood deposits of the Hanford formation. The thickness of the aquifer ranges from about 70 meters at the 14 southwest corner of the site to about 30 meters under the northeast corner of the IDF site. The Elephant 15 Mountain Member of the Columbia River Basalt Group forms the base of the unconfined aquifer 16 (Figure 5.4). 17 The unsaturated zone beneath the land surface at the IDF site is approximately 100 meters thick and 18 consists of the Hanford formation. The water level in boreholes in and around the site indicates that the 19 water table is in the lower gravel sequence of the Hanford formation and at an elevation of approximately 20 123 meters above sea level. The water table is nearly flat beneath the IDF site. Table 5.1 gives water 21 level information from wells near the site. The locations of the wells are shown on Figure 5.1. The latest 22 water table map shows less than about 0.1 meter of hydraulic head differential across the IDF site 23 (Figure 5.5). 24 The Ringold Formation lower mud unit occurs within the aquifer at the southwest corner of the IDF site 25 (299-E17-21) but is absent in the central and northern parts of the site (299-E24-7 and 299-E24-21). The 26 lower mud unit is known to be a confining or partly confining layer at places under the Hanford Site 27 (PNNL-12261) and this might be the case under the southwest corner of the IDF site. Groundwater 28 samples were collected and analyzed from above and below the lower mud unit during drilling of well 29 299-E17-21. Chemical parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, and Eh) were different in the two samples 30 suggesting that the lower mud is at least partly confining in the area. No contamination was found above 31 or below the lower mud. An interpretation of the distribution and thickness of this stratum is shown in 32 Figure 5.4. The surface of the lower mud unit is interpreted to dip gently to the southwest 33 (PNNL-13652). 34 Hydrographs for selected wells near the IDF site are shown in Figure 5.6. Although the water table is 35 extremely flat in the area of the IDF, hydrographs suggest that groundwater flow has had an easterly 36 component throughout the 1990s and has not significantly changed due to cessation of discharges to the 37 216-B Pond system. Hydrographs for the older wells (299-E23-1, 299-E23-2, and 299-E24-7) show two 38 maxima in the water level. These coincide with the operation of the PUREX Plant, which operated 39 between 1956 and 1972 and between 1983 and 1988. All the hydrographs show a decline in the water 40 table during recent years. The rate of decline is between 0.18 and 0.22 meter per year and will take 41 between 10 and 30 years to stabilize. The reason for the decline is the cessation of effluent discharge to 42 the 216-B Pond System, which is centered northeast of 200 East Area. Based on hindcast water table 43 maps (BNWL-B-360), the water table is expected to decline another 2 to 7 meters before reaching 44 pre-Hanford Site elevations. The cessations of effluent discharge also are responsible for changes in the 45 direction of groundwater flow across much of the 200 East Area. 46 Groundwater flow beneath the IDF site recently was modeled to be southeasterly (PNNL- 13400). This 47 direction differs from the easterly direction predicted by the analysis of WHC-SD-WM-RPT-241 and 48 other earlier reports. 49 Chapter 5.8

--- Page 710 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The southeasterly flow direction primarily is attributable to inclusion of the highly permeable Hanford 2 formation sediments in the ancestral Columbia River/Missoula flood channel in the analysis. 3 A southeasterly flow direction is reflected in the geographic distribution of the regional nitrate plume and 4 in the distribution of other constituents under the south-central 200 East Area (PNNL-14187, 1 of 2, 5 2 of 2). As stated in PNNL-13404 (1 of 2, 2 of 2), the water table gradient is too low to be used for 6 determining flow direction or flow rate at the PUREX Plant cribs immediately east of the IDF site. 7 Hydraulic conductivity directly beneath the IDF site was estimated from data collected during four slug 8 tests at well 299-E17-21 and five slug tests of 299-E24-21. The interval tested at 299-E17-21 was the 9 upper 7.8 m of the unconfined aquifer from 101.3 to 109.1 m depth. That portion of the aquifer is 10 Hanford formation gravel from 101.3 to 102.1 m depth and Ringold Formation unit E gravels from 102.1 11 to 109.1 m depth (PNNL-1 1957). The interval tested at well 299-E24-21 was entirely in the Hanford 12 formation gravel sequence between 95.2 and 101.3 m depth. The best fit value to the data from 13 299-E17-21 indicated a hydraulic conductivity of about 68.6 meters per day (PNNL-1 1957) and from 14 299-E24-21 suggested a hydraulic conductivity of 75 meters per day (PNNL-13652). 15 5.4 Contaminant Plume Description 16 Although no groundwater monitoring has been done for the IDF, groundwater monitoring has been done 17 in support of RCRA permitting activities and in support of other activities in the area. The results of that 18 monitoring show that a regional nitrate plume exists beneath the IDF site (PNNL-14187, I of 2, 2 of 2). 19 In the south-central 200 East Area, the plume extends in a northwest -southeast direction along the axis 20 of the Columbia River/Missoula flood channel eroded into the Ringold Formation sediments. The 21 channel is filled with more transmissive Hanford formation sediments. 22 5.4.1 Groundwater Contamination 23 Nitrate, associated with past-practice activities in 200 East Area, is a general groundwater chemistry 24 parameter and is not a contaminant of concern for the IDF. However, the distribution of existing nitrate 25 in the groundwater gives an indication of the general groundwater flow direction and the influence that 26 adjacent sites might have on the IDF. 27 High nitrate concentrations found near liquid waste disposal facilities located outside the IDF site that 28 received effluent from the PUREX Plant are decreasing steadily with time. The highest nitrate 29 concentration found in 2002 was 170,000 pig/L in well 299-E17-9 at the 216-A-36B crib and the crib is 30 thought to be the source of the nitrate. The drinking water standard for nitrate is 45,000 ptg/L (nitrate 31 ion). 32 Nitrate in well 299-E24-18, just inside the east boundary of the IDF site, decreased from a high of 33 86,300 gg/L in 1990 to a low of 17,000 jig/L in 1993, reflecting the cessation of PUREX Plant operations 34 in 1988. Since 1993, nitrate has increased to 48,300 gg/L in 2003 (Figure 5.7). The reason for the 35 increase is not understood. One possibility is related to changing groundwater flow direction. During 36 PUREX Plant operations, flow direction was probably to the northwest because of effluent discharges to 37 the B Pond System and PUREX Plant cribs, and nitrate contamination might have spread to the northwest 38 during that period. Subsequently, liquid discharges to the B Pond System and PUREX Plant cribs have 39 ceased and the flow direction in the area of the IDF site apparently has returned to the southeast direction. 40 With that change, higher levels of nitrate contaminated groundwater might be returning to the area from 41 the northwest. 42 Except for an anomalous value of 82,600 gg/L in 1988, nitrate concentration in well 299-E24-7 was 43 steady and ranged between 12,800 and 35,400 g/L between 1985 and 1996 when the well was last 44 sampled (Figure 5.7). The last two measured values from 1995 and 1996 were 26,000 pg/L. Farther 45 southwest, nitrate detected in 1998 in well 299-E17-21 in Ringold unit E was 23,600 ptg/L. 46 5.4.2 Vadose Zone Contamination 47 Very little characterization and monitoring of the soil have been done at the IDF site because no major 48 construction or waste disposal activities have occurred in this part of the Hanford Site. Chapter 5.9

--- Page 711 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Implementation of the Integrated Disposal Facility Preoperational Monitoring Plan (RPP-6877) has 2 begun and characterization activities will occur during the next few years. The Integrated Disposal 3 Facility Preoperational Monitoring Plan (RPP-6877) has a strong emphasis on vadose zone 4 characterization and deferred groundwater monitoring to this groundwater monitoring plan. Vadose zone 5 information resulting from preoperational monitoring will be included, if applicable, in updates to this 6 groundwater monitoring plan. 7 The Integrated Disposal Facility Preoperational Monitoring Plan (RPP-6877) identified three areas near 8 the IDF site that might have had an influence on the vadose zone beneath the site. These are the 218-E-i 9 Burial Ground and an unplanned release associated with the burial ground; the coal ash pile in the 10 northwest part of the site; and a transfer line along the northern part of the west boundary of the IDF site 11 (RPP-6877). Work was outlined in the Integrated Disposal Facility Preoperational Monitoring Plan to 12 determine whether these three areas had introduced contamination to the site. Appropriate results from 13 preoperational monitoring will be incorporated into this groundwater monitoring plan as results become 14 available and as revisions are needed. 15 In addition to these facilities, the 216-A-38-1, 216-A-45, and 216-A-10 cribs and the 299-E24-1 11 16 injection well are located east of the IDF site. The 216-A-38-1 crib never was used (DOE/RL-92-04). 17 The 299-E24-1 11 injection well never received any waste (DOE/RL-92-04). The 216-A-45 and the 18 216-A 10 cribs both received large quantities of liquid waste (DOE/RL-92-04). Because these latter two 19 facilities are more than 200 meters from the IDF site, it is unlikely these facilities have affected the soil 20 beneath the IDF site. Data from the vadose zone in IDF wells drilled along the east side of the site 21 support this. 22 5.5 Detection Monitoring Program 23 Because the IDF has not been constructed, no contaminants have been released to the ground or to the 24 groundwater. 25 5.5.1 Indicator Parameters, Waste Constituents, Reaction Products to be Monitored 26 5.5.1.1 Regulated Constituents 27 The regulated constituents for this groundwater monitoring plan are the constituents identified on the IDF 28 Part A Form. 29 5.5.1.2 Monitoring Parameters 30 The parameters to be routinely monitored are listed in Table 5.2. These parameters include the indicator 31 parameters and supplemental parameters. 32 The indicator parameters will be used to monitor for hazardous constituents reaching the groundwater as a 33 result of IDF operations. Only the indicator parameters are subject to the statistical methods described in 34 Section 5.5.4.7. Total organic carbon and total organic halides are indicator parameters selected to 35 monitor impacts of RCRA regulated organic constituents on the groundwater quality. Specific 36 conductance is selected as an indicator parameter to monitor impacts of metals and anions on 37 groundwater quality. pH is a general indicator of groundwater quality. Specific conductance and pH are 38 measured in the field at the time of sampling. Chromium is included as an indicator parameter because 39 hexavalent chromium is one of the more mobile of the regulated metals to be disposed of at the IDF and 40 should be one of the first constituents to enter groundwater if the regulated facility impacts groundwater. 41 Analyses of alkalinity, anions, and metals are to provide supplemental data on general groundwater 42 chemistry beneath the IDF. This information aids data interpretation and quality control. Supplemental 43 parameters will not be used in statistical evaluations. Turbidity is analyzed at the well just before 44 sampling and provides an indication of the groundwater condition at the time of sampling. 45 For the first year of monitoring, all parameters listed in Table 5.2 will be monitored twice each quarter to 46 determine background concentrations. Chapter 5.10

--- Page 712 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 After the first year, indicator and supplemental parameters will be monitored semi-annually. In addition, 2 field measurements of temperature and turbidity will be made at each sampling event. 3 During the first sampling event at each well for the first year of monitoring, samples will be collected for 4 analysis of the indicator parameters, the supplemental parameters, and the Appendix IX constituents 5 (40 CFR 264) included in IDF Part A Form. After the first sampling event, samples will be collected for 6 analysis of indicator parameters and supplemental parameters only. 7 After the first year of sampling, if an indicator parameter suggests there is an impact to groundwater, 8 additional samples will be collected to verify the initial results. If a statistically significant increase in any 9 indicator parameter is confirmed, analyses will be made for the regulated parameters in IDF Part A Form. 10 Monitoring for baseline conditions was completed for the indicator parameters in April 2006 and for the 11 complete Appendix IX list in January 2007. Semi-annual monitoring has continued since that time with 12 the collection of four independent samples each semiannual period. During the Pre-Active life, sampling 13 will continue at the IDF with the collection of one sample each year to maintain the baseline. When the 14 IDF becomes operational, sampling will revert to four independent samples collected each semiannual 15 period. 16 5.5.1.3 Dangerous Waste Characterization 17 This section describes the waste to be disposed in the IDF and gives background information on how the 18 constituents of concern (regulated constituents) and indicator parameters were selected. 19 5.5.1.3.1 Volume of the Waste Package 20 The IDF will be a single, expandable disposal facility constructed to RCRA Subtitle C standards, half of 21 which is for disposal of mixed waste the other half will be for disposal of low-level waste. Initial capacity 22 for mixed waste disposal is 82,000 cubic meters of waste with an ultimate capacity of up to 450,000 cubic 23 meters of waste. Disposal capacity beyond the initial 82,000 cubic meters will require a modification to 24 the Part B Permit. The mixed waste types to be disposed in the IDF include vitrified Low Activity Waste 25 (LAW) from the RPP-WTP and DBVS. Additionally, mixed waste generated by IDF operations will be 26 disposed of in IDF. 27 The vitrified LAW will be mostly silicate glass monoliths. The RPP-WTP packages nominally measure 28 approximately 1.22 m diameter by 2.3 m high and the DBVS package nominally measure approximately 29 2.4 m wide by 3.1 m high by 7.3 m long. Vitrified LAW will be remote handled. 30 If other forms of immobilized LAW are considered in the future, this monitoring plan will be amended. 31 Mixed waste generated through waste operations at IDF will be packaged based on the size of the waste, 32 with the most common container being galvanized or aluminized 208 liter containers. 33 5.5.1.3.2 Composition of the Waste Packages 34 HNF-4921 provides detailed estimates for the inventory of hazardous chemicals in the vitrified LAW feed 35 and in the vitrified LAW package. The composition of the vitrified LAW package was estimated in 36 HNF-4921 based on: 37 1) The Tank Waste Retrieval System Characterization Program tank-by-tank Best Basis Inventories. 38 2) The latest U.S. Department of Energy, Office of River Protection (DOE/ORP) guidance. 39 3) The requirements for waste retrieval and vitrification. 40 4) Available information from waste treatment plant contractors, and (5) proposed operating 41 scenarios for retrieval of waste from Double Shell Tanks (DSTs) and Single Shell Tanks (SSTs). 42 5.5.1.4 Behavior of Constituents 43 Almost all of the regulated constituents for the IDF show some degree of retardation in the vadose zone 44 and in the saturated zone. Chapter 5.11

--- Page 713 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Table 5.3 indicates the range of expected behaviors in the subsurface at the IDF for selected regulated 2 constituents. The constituents in Table 5.3 were selected by comparing the expected constituents in the 3 vitrified LAW package (from HNF-492 1) and the historical inventories of the Hanford Site low-level 4 burial grounds (from WHC-MR-0008 and WHC-SD-EN-AP-0 15) to 40 CFR 264, Appendix IX (see IDF 5 Part A Form). The mobilities and solubilities in Table 5.3 give an estimated range for the properties of 6 the constituents of concern. 7 5.5.1.5 Detectability 8 The detection limits in groundwater for each RCRA regulated constituent and the indicator parameters are 9 given in Table 5.4. 10 5.5.2 Groundwater Monitoring Program 11 The following sections provide a description of wells, equipment decontamination, representative 12 samples, and monitoring wells that are not upgradient. 13 5.5.2.1 Description of Wells 14 The groundwater monitoring well network for the IDF ultimately will have eight wells: three 15 hydraulically upgradient of the facility and five hydraulically downgradient. The downgradient wells will 16 be placed to sample groundwater passing the point of compliance. The point of compliance at the IDF 17 site is a plane connecting the groundwater monitoring wells along the southern and eastern sides of the 18 site in accordance with WAC 173-303-645(6), which states "The point of compliance is a vertical surface 19 located at the hydraulically downgradient limit of the waste management area that extends down into the 20 uppermost aquifer underlying the regulated unit". The monitoring network will consist of existing and 21 new, downgradient wells to complete the monitoring network. All wells will be WAC 173-160 22 compliant. 23 Three upgradient wells will be used for the IDF monitoring network. Two of these wells (299-E18-1 and 24 299-E24-21) are existing wells. Upgradient well 299-E24-21 was installed in March 2001 for 25 characterization of the IDF site. The well, located at the northeast corner of the site (Figure 5.8), was 26 constructed to RCRA standards as per WAC 173-160. Well 299-E18-1 was installed in 1988 as part of 27 the 2101-M RCRA monitoring network. The well currently has 2 to 3 meters of water above the bottom 28 of the screened interval. 29 The third upgradient well will be a new well located at the northwest corner of the IDF (Figure 5.8). The 30 well will be constructed to RCRA standard as per WAC 173-160 and screened at the water table. 31 Three of the downgradient wells are existing wells (299-E17-22, 299-E17-23, and 299-E17-25) that were 32 installed as WAC 173-160 compliant wells in 2002. Their location is shown in Figure 5.8. The 33 remaining two downgradient wells will be installed in a sequence coordinated with the IDF operations. 34 Three phases of trench construction are assumed for the purposes of this monitoring plan. Excavation for 35 the first phase is scheduled for September 2004 and a new phase is planned for every ten subsequent 36 years. Changes in the planned operations of the IDF will be reflected in changes to this groundwater 37 monitoring plan as needed. 38 The first new downgradient well will be installed along the eastern side of the facility (Figure 5.8) at least 39 one year before the IDF receives waste. The second new downgradient well will be installed along the 40 southern boundary of the Site at least one year before the third phase of waste disposal becomes 41 operational. Both wells will be installed such that at least one year of background data can be obtained 42 prior to the associated operational phase becoming active. Figure 5.8 shows the sequence for both 43 groundwater well construction and waste disposal. The locations of all existing and new wells in the IDF 44 monitoring network are noted on the figure. 45 Chapter 5.12

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I The placement of the wells for the IDF monitoring network was based on professional judgment. The 2 efficiency of the resulting groundwater monitoring network was evaluated using a simple two 3 dimensional, horizontal transport model called the monitoring efficiency model (MEMO) (Wilson et al. 4 1992). The model estimates the efficiency of a monitoring network at the point of compliance. The 5 model simulates a contaminant plume originating from a series of grid points within the disposal facility 6 using the Domenico-Robbins method (Domenico and Robbins, 1985). The model calculates both 7 advective flow and dispersive flow in two dimensions and determines whether the resulting plume will be 8 detected by a monitoring well before the plume travels some selected distance beyond the disposal facility 9 boundary. The selected distance is termed the buffer zone. (A longitudinal dispersivity of 95 meters and 10 horizontal dispersivity of 9.5 meters were used to evaluate the monitoring network in Figure 5.8.) 11 Outputs from the model are the monitoring efficiency and a map of the disposal facility showing areas 12 where leaks would not be detected under the given site-specific parameters provided as input to the 13 model. Monitoring efficiency is defined as the ratio of the area within a disposal facility from which a 14 release likely would be detected to the total area of the disposal facility, expressed as a percentage. 15 The monitoring efficiency calculated by the MEMO model for the proposed monitoring network is 100% 16 for phase I, 98% for phase II, and 99% for phase III (Figure 5.8). 17 All wells for the IDF site will be constructed to meet WAC 173-160 requirements. The wells will be 18 protected at the surface with a concrete pad, protective posts, a protective outer casing, and locking cap. 19 The casing and screen will be stainless steel, an appropriate filter pack for the screen slot size will be 20 used, and an annular seal of bentonite and cement will be emplaced. All wells will be screened at the 21 water table with 10.6 meter long screens, which will accommodate the greatest possible future decrease in 22 water level. The wells will be developed and dedicated sampling pumps will be installed. 23 New wells will be surveyed with a down hole gyroscope at the time of construction to determine any 24 deviation from vertical so that corrections can be made to subsequent water level measurements. 25 Gyroscope surveys will also be conducted on existing wells in the network prior to IDF operations. 26 5.5.2.2 Equipment Decontamination 27 Drilling equipment will be decontaminated using high temperature and pressure [82oC (1800F) and 28 greater than 70.3 kg/cm2 (1,000 psi)] washing with an approved cleaning solution. The equipment will be 29 rinsed with clean water. The procedure is specified in controlled manuals. 30 Equipment for collecting soil samples during drilling for later chemical analysis and for measuring the 31 water table will be decontaminated according to established methods. The methods call for washing 32 equipment with phosphate free detergent, rinsing three times with reverse osmosis/de-ionized water, 33 rinsing once with IM or 10% nitric acid (glass or stainless steel equipment only), rinsing three more times 34 with reverse osmosis/de-ionized water, and a final rinse with chromatograph grade hexane. Equipment 35 will be dried for 50 minutes at 100oC (2120F). After drying, equipment will be wrapped in unused 36 aluminum foil and sealed with tape. 37 No decontamination of groundwater sampling equipment will be necessary because each well will have a 38 dedicated pump. 39 5.5.2.3 Representative Samples 40 No groundwater chemistry data specific to the IDF site are available. Sample representativeness will be 41 addressed after collection of the first year of background data. 42 5.5.2.4 Locations of Background Groundwater Monitoring Wells that are not Upgradient 43 All background groundwater monitoring wells at the IDF are located upgradient. Chapter 5.13

--- Page 715 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 5.5.3 Background Values 2 Groundwater background (baseline) has not been established for the IDF site. Background data will be 3 determined before construction of the site using the wells described previously (Section 5.5.2.1) for the 4 use of upgradient vs. downgradient comparisons (Section 5.5.4.7). 5 5.5.3.1 Plan for Establishing Groundwater Quality Data 6 Well location, sampling frequency, sampling quantity, and background values are discussed in the 7 following sections. 8 5.5.3.1.1 Well Locations 9 Groundwater monitoring wells in the IDF monitoring network were described in Section 5.5.2.1 and their 10 locations are shown on Figure 5.8. 11 5.5.3.1.2 Sampling Frequency 12 Eight background samples will be collected during the first year of monitoring from phase I wells. Two 13 samples will be collected quarterly for one year. For the new well needed for phase III operations, two 14 samples will be collected quarterly for one year before phase III is operational. For all wells, two 15 independent samples will be collected each quarter, one per month for 2 consecutive months followed by 16 a month of non-sampling. This sequence will be repeated each quarter during the first year of monitoring. 17 Section 5.5.3.1.3 provides frequency logic. 18 5.5.3.1.3 Sampling Quantites 19 The performance of the statistical method proposed for the IDF is evaluated by the following two goals: 20 * To have adequate statistical power to detect real contamination when contamination occurs. 21 * To keep the network wide Type I error (across all constituents and wells being tested) at an 22 acceptably low level (approximately 5%). [Note that the Type I error in the detection monitoring 23 stage equates to the false positive rate, that is, the probability that the test will indicate 24 contamination has occurred although no contamination has truly occurred.] 25 The statistical power and the network-side false positive rate of a test depend on several factors, including 26 the background sample size, the type of proposed test, and the number of comparisons. All other factors 27 being equal, the larger the sample size is (i.e., the number of background samples), the greater the 28 statistical power is. Therefore, as recommended in EPA/530-R-93-003, at least eight independent 29 samples will be collected from each well for background purposes. This is a sufficient number of samples 30 to establish a reliable background (EPA/530-R-93-003) and meets the regulations in 31 WAC 173-303-645(9)(d). 32 5.5.3.1.4 Background Values 33 The default method of analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to detect any impact on groundwater 34 quality at the IDF where the mean of the measurements from compliance (downgradient) wells is 35 compared to the mean of the distribution of background data from the upgradient wells. The details of the 36 method are described in Section 5.5.4.7.1. 37 5.5.4 Sampling, Analysis and Statistical Procedures 38 Sample collection, sample preservation and transfer/shipment, analytical procedures, chain of custody and 39 additional requirements for compliance point monitoring are discussed in the following sections. 40 5.5.4.1 Sample Collection 41 Groundwater sampling procedures, sample collection documentation, sample preservation and 42 transfer/shipment, and chain-of-custody requirements are described in subcontractor operating 43 procedures/manuals and in a quality assurance project plan for the Hanford Groundwater Performance 44 Assessment Project. Chapter 5.14

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Quality requirements for sampling activities, including requirements for procedures, containers, transport, 2 storage, chain of custody, and records requirements, are specified in a statement of work (SOW) to 3 subcontractors. To ensure that samples of known quality are obtained, the subcontractor will be required 4 to use contractor controlled procedures based on standard methods for groundwater sampling whenever 5 possible. The procedures will be reviewed for technical quality and consistency. In addition, periodic 6 assessments of sample collection activities will be performed to ensure further that procedures are 7 followed to maintain sample quality and integrity. The following is a brief description of the sampling 8 requirements. 9 Samples generally will be collected after three casing volumes of groundwater are withdrawn or after the 10 field parameters pH, temperature, and specific conductance have stabilized. Field parameters are 11 measured in a flow through chamber. Turbidity should be equal to or below 5 NTU (nephelometric 12 turbidity units) before sample collection if possible. Sample preservatives will be added to the collection 13 bottles in the laboratory before their use in the field. Samples to be analyzed for metals will be filtered in 14 the field to ensure results represent dissolved metals and do not include particulates (40 CFR 136.3). 15 Duplicates, trip blanks, and field equipment blanks will be collected as part of the general quality control 16 program. 17 Water level measurements will be made each time a well is sampled. Procedures developed in 18 accordance with the techniques described in American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM 1988), 19 Garber and Koopman (1968), and U. S. Geological Survey (1977) will be followed to measure water 20 levels. Water levels will be measured primarily with laminated steel electrical sounding tapes, although 21 graduated steel tapes are used occasionally. 22 5.5.4.2 Sample Preservation and Shipment 23 Sample preservation will be done in accordance with existing procedures. A chemical preservative label 24 will be affixed to the sample container listing the specific preservative. The brand name, lot number, 25 concentration, and date opened of the preservatives will be recorded. A calibrated dispenser or pipette 26 will be used to dispense preservatives. Appropriate measures will be taken to eliminate any potential for 27 cross contamination. 28 Sample packaging and transfer/shipping will be done in accordance with subcontract procedures. 29 Samples will be labeled and sealed with evidence tape, wrapped with bubble wrap, and placed in a 30 Department of Transportation approved container with coolant (if required). Hazardous samples will 31 have packaging parameters determined by associated hazards. A chain of custody will accompany all 32 samples. 33 5.5.4.3 Analytical Procedures 34 The methods for analysis of chemical constituents in groundwater will conform to Test Methods for 35 Evaluating Solid Wastes: Physical/Chemical Methods, 3rd Ed. (SW-846); Methods for Chemical Analysis 36 of Water and Wastes (EPA-600/4-79-020) or other EPA methods; and the Annual Book ofASTM 37 Standards (American Society for Testing and Materials, 1986). The methods used to obtain routine data 38 results are presented in Table 5.4. 39 5.5.4.3.1 Data Storage and Retrieval 40 All contract analytical laboratory results will be submitted by the laboratory to be loaded into the Hanford 41 Environmental Information System (HEIS) database. Most data are received from the laboratory in 42 electronic form, and will be loaded electronically. Parameters measured in the field will be entered into 43 HEIS either manually or through electronic transfer. Hard copy data reports are received for records 44 storage. Data from the HEIS database will be retrieved for data validation, data reduction, and trend 45 analysis. Copies of supporting analytical data will be sent yearly to Pacific Northwest National 46 Laboratory (PNNL) for storage. Chapter 5.15

--- Page 717 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 5.5.4.3.2 Data Verification and Validation 2 Verification of analytical data provided by the subcontracted laboratory will be performed in accordance 3 with established procedure. This procedure includes checks for: (1) completeness of hardcopy 4 deliverable, (2) condition of samples on receipt by the laboratory, (3) problems that arose during the 5 analysis of the samples, and (4) correct reporting of results. The procedure also describes the actions to 6 be taken if data are incomplete or deficient. 7 Verification and validation of groundwater chemistry data will be performed according to established 8 procedures. Data will be reviewed quarterly to assure the data are complete and representative. The 9 review will include evaluation of quality control data (e.g., field blanks, duplicates, and laboratory blanks) 10 and a technical review by a project scientist familiar with the hydrogeology of the site. The technical 11 review might include comparison of recent data to historical trends and comparison of related 12 constituents. Suspect data will be investigated through the data review process in accordance with 13 established procedures and will be flagged in the database. 14 5.5.4.3.3 Reporting 15 Groundwater chemistry and water level data will be reviewed after each sampling event and will be 16 available in the HEIS database. The results of the statistical evaluation and associated information will be 17 submitted to Ecology quarterly in Hanford Site groundwater monitoring reports. 18 If statistically, significant evidence of contamination is determined (after waste has been introduced to the 19 facility and after the confirmation re-sampling evaluation process) for one or more of the indicator 20 parameters at any monitoring well at the compliance point, and if the owner or operator decides not to 21 make a false positive claim, the following will be performed. 22 * Notify Ecology in writing within 7 days of the finding indicating which chemical parameters or 23 dangerous waste constituents have shown statistically significant evidence of contamination. 24 * Determine whether dangerous constituents are present and, if so, in what concentration. 25 * The owner or operator might re-sample within I month and repeat the analysis for those 26 compounds detected in the above (i.e., second bullet). The resample data will be compared with 27 the trigger value. 28 * Submit an application for a permit modification, if necessary, to establish a compliance 29 monitoring program to Ecology in 90 days or within the time agreed to in writing by Ecology. 30 The dangerous constituents detected, either in the initial analysis or in the second confirmation analysis, 31 will form the basis for compliance monitoring. 32 In case of a false positive claim [as allowed by WAC 173-303-645(9)(g)(vi)], the following will apply. 33 * Notify Ecology in writing within 7 days of the finding (i.e., exceedance) and indicate that a false 34 positive claim will be made. 35 * Submit a report to Ecology within 90 days or within the time agreed to in writing by Ecology. 36 This report should demonstrate that a source other than the regulated unit caused the 37 contamination or that the contamination resulted from an error in sampling, analysis, evaluation, 38 or natural variation in groundwater chemistry. 39 * Submit an application for a permit modification, if necessary, to make any appropriate changes to 40 the detection monitoring program within 90 days or within the time agreed to in writing by 41 Ecology. 42 * Continue to monitor in accordance with the detection monitoring program. 43 * Submit an application for a permit modification, if the detection monitoring program is 44 determined to no longer satisfy the requirements [of WAC 173-303-645(9)], to make any 45 appropriate changes to the program within 90 days or within the time agreed to in writing by 46 Ecology.

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 5.5.4.4 Chain of Custody 2 The procedures used for chain-of-custody control of samples are documented in existing manuals. The 3 procedure requires that each transfer of custody shall be documented by the signatures of the custodian 4 relinquishing the samples and the custodian receiving the samples, as well as the time and date of transfer. 5 The laboratory custodian will sign and date the chain-of-custody form upon receipt of the samples at the 6 laboratory. 7 5.5.4.5 Additional Requirements for Compliance Point Monitoring 8 This section describes sampling frequency and determination of groundwater quality for the samples from 9 the groundwater monitoring network. Compliance data will be compared to baseline data collected from 10 the upgradient wells and a determination of impacts to groundwater will be made using the proposed 11 ANOVA method (explained in Section 5.5.4.7.1). 12 5.5.4.5.1 Sampling Frequency 13 Under final status regulations, the default sampling procedure states that a sequence of at least four 14 samples from each well (background and compliance wells) must be collected at least semiannually 15 during detection monitoring at an interval that ensures, to the greatest extent technically feasible, that an 16 independent sample is obtained [40 CFR 264.97(g)(1) and (2), WAC 173-303-645(8)(g)(i) and (ii), and 17 (9)(d)]. 18 The default sampling procedures are adopted for the IDF Active life as follows: four independent samples 19 from each groundwater monitoring well will be sampled for the indicator parameters (Table 5.2) 20 semiannually during the active life of the regulated unit (including the closure period), one per month for 21 four consecutive months followed by two months of non-sampling. The mean of the measurements from 22 the downgradient wells will be compared semiannually to the mean of the distribution of the background 23 data using ANOVA. 24 Semi-annual monitoring has been accomplished at the IDF since January 2007 with the collection of four 25 independent samples each semiannual period. During the Pre-Active life, sampling will continue at the 26 IDF with the collection of one sample each year to maintain the baseline. During Active life, sampling 27 will revert to four independent samples collected each semiannual period described above. 28 5.5.4.5.2 Compliance Point Groundwater Quality Values 29 The groundwater quality data collected from the groundwater monitoring wells will be compared to the 30 mean of the background data from upgradient wells for each constituent by ANOVA. If the mean is 31 calculated from transformed baseline data (logarithmic transformation or nonparametric approach), then 32 the monitoring data will be transformed accordingly; otherwise, the original monitoring data will be used 33 in the comparisons. 34 During detection monitoring, data verification will be applied in case of an initial exceedance. For 35 ANOVA test, if the test of hypothesis of equal means for all wells fails, post hoc comparisons are needed 36 to determine which compliance well(s) is (are) contaminated. This will be done by comparing 37 concentration differences (called contrasts in the ANOVA and multiple comparison framework) between 38 each compliance well with the background wells (EPA/530-SW-89-026). If the contaminated compliance 39 well(s) is (are) determined by post hoc comparisons, verification sampling will be implemented for the 40 constituent(s) in question. Verification sampling is needed to determine if the exceedance is an artifact 41 caused by an error in sampling, analysis, or statistical evaluation or an actual variation in groundwater 42 chemistry. A collection of at least four measurements from the re-sampled compliance well(s) is required 43 to perform ANOVA test on comparison with the mean of the background data (EPA/530-R-93-003). 44 Adequate time should elapse to ensure statistical independence between the original measurements and 45 the re-sample measurements, which is assured by the sampling frequency proposed in Section 5.5.4.5.1. 46 The existing nitrate plume beneath the IDF site is described in Section 5.4.1. Nitrate is not included in 47 IDF Part A Form and, therefore, is not a constituent of concern for the IDF. Chapter 5.17

--- Page 719 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 Existing groundwater conditions will be monitored by the indicator parameters and supplemental 2 constituents as described in Section 5.5.1. Specific conductance will respond to nitrate so that any 3 changes in the nitrate concentration will be reflected by changes in the indicator parameter specific 4 conductance. 5 Anion analysis is one of the supplemental constituents to be monitored at the IDF site. Anion analysis 6 will determine the nitrate concentration. Therefore, through comparison of regression lines of specific 7 conductance and nitrate (Zar,1999) and/or contaminant source analysis (Gibbons, 1994), it can be 8 determined whether any change in specific conductance is due to a change in nitrate. If a change in 9 specific conductance is due to a change in nitrate, then that specific conductance change is not attributed 10 to the IDF. If, however, a statistically significant change in specific conductance is not attributable to 11 nitrate, verification sampling will occur as described above. 12 5.5.4.6 Annual Determination 13 Groundwater flow rate and flow direction at the IDF site will be determined annually for the uppermost 14 aquifer. Flow rate will be determined by calculation using the groundwater gradient, and the Darcy flow 15 equation, vh = Khih/ne, where Vh is the horizontal groundwater velocity, Kh is the horizontal hydraulic 16 conductivity, ih is the horizontal hydraulic gradient, and ne is the effective porosity. Effective porosities 17 used at Hanford Site RCRA regulated units are on the order of 0.1 to 0.3 (PNNL-14187, 1 of 2, 2 of 2); 18 effective porosity might be determined specifically for the IDF from hydrologic tests. 19 Hydraulic gradients will be determined from measurements of water levels. 20 5.5.4.7 Statistical Determination 21 This section describes the method of statistical evaluation and the statistical procedures to indicate 22 whether dangerous waste or dangerous waste constituents from the IDF might have entered the 23 groundwater in the uppermost aquifer. These evaluations will be made as soon as practicable after 24 validation of the full data set from each sampling event. 25 The monitoring program periodically will re-evaluate the statistical tests being used. The methods 26 described will be reviewed during and after background, data are collected to ensure the methods are the 27 most appropriate, considering site conditions. 28 The goal of a RCRA final status detection-monitoring program [WAC 173-303-645(9)] is to monitor for 29 indicator parameters that provide a reliable indication of the presence of dangerous constituents in 30 groundwater in the uppermost aquifer beneath the site. This is accomplished by testing for statistically 31 significant changes in concentrations of indicators in downgradient wells relative to baseline values. The 32 default statistical method ANOVA is proposed for the detection monitoring program of the IDF. The 33 proposed statistical method is consistent with EPA/530-SW-89-026, EPA/530-R-93-003, and 34 WAC 173-303-645. 35 The number of tested constituents will be limited to the indicators to maintain a sufficiently low false- 36 positive rate (EPA/530-R-93-003, page 62; Gibbons 1994, page 16). Verification sampling is an integral 37 part of the statistical design to lower the overall false-positive rate and determine whether the difference 38 between background and compliance-point data is an artifact caused by an error in sampling, analysis, or 39 statistical evaluation (Section 5.5.4.5.2). 40 5.5.4.7.1 Statistical Procedure 41 In accordance with WAC 173-303-645(8)(h), acceptable statistical methodology includes analysis of 42 variance (ANOVA), tolerance intervals, prediction intervals, control charts, test of proportions, or other 43 statistical methods approved by Ecology. The type of monitoring, the nature of the data, the proportions 44 of non-detects, and spatial and temporal variations are some of the important factors to be considered in 45 the selection of appropriate statistical methods. The EPA default method ANOVA will be implemented 46 for the IDF site to compare the differences of means of the measurements from upgradient and 47 downgradient wells. Chapter 5.18

--- Page 720 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The detailed discussions of the ANOVA test can be found in EPA/530-SW-89-026 and statistical 2 textbooks (Gilbert, 1987; Casella and Berger. 1990; Davis, 2002), and can be executed using commercial 3 statistical software such as SAS or SYSTAT. Under WAC 173-303-645(8)(i)(ii), the proposed statistical 4 method must comply with the performance standard, that is, for a multiple comparisons procedure the 5 Type I error level must be no less than 0.05, and maintained at the level of no less than 0.01 for individual 6 well comparisons. By definition, Type I error is the false rejection rate of the null hypothesis (Ho) of the 7 statistical test. In detection or compliance monitoring, the statistical test is defined as Ho: no release, i.e., 8 the means of the distributions from upgradient and downgradient wells are the same, and the alternative 9 (Ha) evidence of release, e.g., "clean until proven contaminated" (EPA/530-R-93-003). Therefore, the 10 proposed statistical method must comply with the requirement of maintaining Type I error, which equates 11 false positive rate in the stage of detection monitoring at approximate 5% level. As described in 12 EPA/530-SW-89-026, ANOVA procedures have the advantages of combining multiple downgradient into 13 a single statistical test, thus enabling the network-wide false positive rate for any single constituent (not 14 multiple constituents) to be kept at 5 percent, and also maintain reasonable power for detecting 15 contamination. 16 The details of the ANOVA procedures are described as follows (EPA/530-SW-89-026): 17 * First, check the proportion of non-detects of the measurements from the upgradient and 18 downgradient wells. When the proportion of non-detects is less than 15%, the non-detects will be 19 reported as one-half the minimum detection limit or practical quantitation limit, and proceed with 20 parametric ANOVA analysis. When the proportion of non-detects is greater than 15%, 21 non-parametric ANOVA analysis will be used for comparing the means of downgradient and 22 upgradient wells. 23 * Evaluate the distributions of the measurements from the upgradient and downgradient wells. The 24 assumptions with parametric ANOVA test are the residuals are normally distributed with equal 25 variance. The normality of the distribution the residuals can be checked using coefficient of 26 variation, plotting the data on probability plot, and/or Shapiro-Wilk's test (EPA/530-SW-89-026; 27 Gibbons, 1994). The assumption of normality usually can be met by log-transforming the data or 28 by other Box-Cox transformations. When the assumptions of normality and lognormality cannot 29 be justified, the non-parametric ANOVA method will be used for the IDF. Bartlett's test can be 30 used in checking equality, or homogeneity, of variances. 31 * The parametric ANOVA procedures include: 32 * Assume a monitoring network with k wells, and total number of observations N. First, 33 compute well total, well mean, and well residuals (observations subtracted by well mean) for 34 each well, and grand total and mean of all observations (all wells). The well residuals are 35 used to check the assumption of normality. 36 * Compute the sum of squares of difference between well means and the grand mean, SSwells 37 that is a measure of the variability between wells with (k-1) degrees of freedom. 38 * Compute the total sum of squares of differences between all observations and the grand 39 mean, SStotal, which is a measure of the variability in all observations with (N-1) degrees of 40 freedom. 41 * Compute the sum of squares of differences of observations within wells from the well means, 42 SSerror, which is a measure of the variability within wells with (N-k) degrees of freedom 43 calculated by the following subtraction: 44 SSnor = SStotal -SSwells 45 * Test the hypothesis of equal means for all k wells by computing F value with the means 46 squares of differences: 47 F = MSwells / MSeor Chapter 5.19

--- Page 721 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 where the means of squares are the sums of squares divided by the associated degrees of 2 freedom, that is, MSwenls = SSwelns / (k-1), and MSerror = SSerror / (N-k). Compare the F value to 3 the tabulated F statistics with (k-1) and (N-k) degress of freedom at the 5% significance level 4 (EPA/530-SW 89-026, Appendix B, Table 2). If the calculated F value exceeds the tabulated 5 F statistics, the null hypothesis of equal well means is rejected. Proceed with test of contrasts 6 in the next step. Otherwise, the hypothesis of equal means is accepted that there is no 7 significant difference between the concentrations at k wells (upgradient and downgradient 8 wells), that is, no evidence of contamination. 9 * If the hypothesis of equal well means is rejected, contrasts (concentration differences between a 10 compliance well and background wells) will be tested for each compliance well to determine 11 which compliance well(s) is (are) contaminated. Bonferroni t-statistics will be computed to 12 determine if the significant F value is due to difference between background and compliance 13 wells. Assume that of the k wells, kb are background (upgradient) wells, and kc are compliance 14 (downgradient) wells (i.e., kb + k, = k). Each of the k, compliance wells is compared to the mean 15 of the background wells as the following steps: 16 * Compute the mean mb from the kb background wells with a total of nb samples. 17 * Compute the difference D, between the mean from the i' compliance well and the mean from 18 the background wells. 19 * Compute the standard error of the difference from the i' compliance well with ni observations 20 as: 21 SEi= [MSrror (1/nb + /Di)1 22 where MSerror is computed previously as the measure of variability within wells. 23 * Obtain the t-statistics from Bonferroni's t-table (EPA/530-SW-89-026, Appendix B, Table 3) 24 with a significance level of (u=0.05/ke) but no less than 0.01 (for individual comparison) and 25 (N-k) degrees of freedom. The critical value for the il compliance well is defined as Ci = SEi 26 x t. 27 * If the difference Di exceeds the critical value Ci, conclude that the mean of the i' compliance 28 well is significantly higher than the mean of the background wells. Otherwise, conclude that 29 the well is not contaminated. 30 * The one-way non-parametric ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that the data from each well come 31 from the same continuous distribution and hence have the same median. The procedures, called 32 the Kruskal-Wallis test, include the following steps: 33 * Assume the monitoring network as defined previously with a total of N observations from k 34 wells (kb background wells and kc compliance wells). Rank all N observations from least (1) 35 to greatest (N). Let the background wells be group 1, and denote the compliance wells as 36 group 2 to (kc+1). (one group per compliance well). 37 * Compute the sum (Ri) and the average (mi) of the ranks of the ni observations in the ith 38 group. 39 * Compute the Kruskal-Wallis statistics (H) as 40 H 2 -3(N + 1) N (N + 1I) i= n1 41 * Compare the calculated H value to the tabulated chi-squared value with kc degrees of freedom 42 (EPA/530-SW-89-026, Appendix B, Table 1). The null hypothesis of equal medians is rejected 43 when the calculated H value exceeds the tabulated critical value. Chapter 5.20

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * When the null hypothesis of equal medians is rejected, compute the critical difference Ci for 2 each compliance well to the background data (group 1 with nb observations): 3 C, = Z(0 05 / kc) N(N+1) 1 ]1/2 12 nb i, 4 Where Z(O.05/ kc) is the upper (0.05/kc) percentile from the standard normal distribution 5 (EPA/530-SW-89-026, Appendix B, Table 4). If there are more than five compliance wells 6 (k; > 5), use Zool, the upper one-percentile from the standard normal distribution (Zo o=2.32) for 7 individual comparison (WAC 173-303-645(8)(i)(ii)). 8 * Compute the difference (Di = mi -mi) of average rank mi (i=2 to kc+1) for each compliance well 9 to the background (mi). Compare the difference Di to the critical value Ci for each compliance 10 well. If Di exceeds Ci, conclude that the median of the il compliance well is significantly higher 11 than the background median. 12 * As monitoring continues, the background data will be updated periodically (e.g., every year or 13 two) to incorporate the new data from upgradient wells. This updating process will continue for 14 the life of the monitoring program. Prior to updating older background data with more recent 15 results, a two-sample t-test will be run to compare the older concentration levels with the 16 concentrations of the proposed update samples. If the t-test does not show a significant difference 17 at the 5 percent significant level, proceed to re-estimate the baseline parameters by including the 18 more recent data. If the t-test does show a significant difference, the newer data will not be 19 included as background unless some specific factors can be, identified explaining why 20 background levels at the IDF site have naturally changed (EPA/530-R93-003). 21 Formal testing for outliers will be done when an observation of the background data seems inconsistently 22 high (by orders of magnitude) compared to the rest of the data set in order to avoid the artificial increase 23 of the mean of the background data and a corresponding increase of the false negative rate. Statistical 24 methods such as the Grubbs' method (Grubbs, 1969), the box-and-whisker plot (Ostle and Malone, 1988), 25 EPA guidance (EPA/530-SW-89-026, p. 11-14) and/or American Society for Testing and Materials 26 guidance (ASTM 1996) will be used for testing outliers. The outliers must be checked to determine if the 27 measurements are in error and need to be corrected or excluded from calculating the background mean. If 28 no specific error is found, the measurements must be retained in the data. 29 A statistically significant exceedance over background (baseline) levels only indicates that the new 30 measurement in a particular monitoring well for a particular constituent is inconsistent with chance 31 expectations based on the available sample of background (baseline) measurements. Any statistical result 32 must be supported by other information to determine if a waste disposal facility has impacted 33 groundwater (ASTM 1996). 34 5.5.4.7.2 Results 35 Sampling and analysis results are reviewed at least semiannually (i.e., after each sampling event) and are 36 available in HEIS. The DOE will submit results of statistical evaluations to Ecology. 37 5.5.5 Compliance Monitoring Program 38 A compliance monitoring program that satisfies requirements set forth in WAC 173-303-645(10) will be 39 established for the IDF if detection-level monitoring reveals statistically significant evidence of dangerous 40 waste contamination from sources within the regulated unit. If compliance monitoring is required, DOE 41 will submit a revised monitoring plan to Ecology specifying dangerous constituents to be monitored, 42 sampling and analysis protocols, statistical evaluation methods, etc. In the compliance monitoring 43 program, the dangerous constituents or parameters will be compared to concentration limits specified in 44 the facility permit as discussed in WAC 173-303-645(5) during the compliance period. Chapter 5.21

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 The RCRA regulations [WAC 173-303-645(9)(g)] state that if a statistical exceedance occurs in a 2 downgradient well, the entire network immediately must be resampled and analyzed for the constituents 3 in Appendix IX of 40 CFR 264. This sampling would be conducted in parallel with a required permit 4 modification. Appendix IX is an extensive list including a wide variety of volatile and semivolatile 5 organic compounds and trace metals. It is prudent to narrow the analyte list to the specific exceedance 6 event; e.g., if the exceeding contaminant is total organic halides, the project would analyze for the 7 halogenated hydrocarbons most likely to be present in the area. Results of the resampling will form the 8 basis for returning to detection monitoring or designing a compliance monitoring program. 9 5.5.6 Corrective Action Program 10 If, at a point of compliance (a well), dangerous constituents of concern are measured in the groundwater 11 at concentrations that exceed the applicable groundwater concentration limit, Ecology must be notified in 12 7 days, and an application to modify the permit to include a corrective action plan must be sent to 13 Ecology within 90 days or within the time agreed to by Ecology. A description of the groundwater 14 monitoring plan, including all additional corrective actions that are appropriate for a corrective action 15 program will be prepared and submitted to Ecology when the need for corrective action first is identified.

For all organics (except carbon tetrachloride), the calculation assumes an organic carbon content 6 for Hanford Site soil of 1.0%. The value of organic carbon assumed is conservative recognizing that the organic carbon content 7 of most Hanford Site soil falls considerably below this value. However, applying this level of conservatism also recognizes that 8 mineral-driven sorption likely plays a role in organic constituent mobility for Hanford Site soils with organic carbon content at or 9 below 0.1% (PNNL-13560). A calculation of a Kd value using acetonitrile as an example is as follows. The literature estimated 10 value of Koc for acetonitrile is 16 (Howard 1993). 11 Kd = c X Koc where foc= the mass fraction of organic carbon in the soil. 12 Kd (acetonitrile) = 0.01 X 16 = 0.16. 13 2 Creosote is a coal tar distillate containing high quantities of naphthalene and anthracene (Lewis, R.J., Sr. 1993). 14 ' Because creosote is predominately a mixture of naphthalene and anthracene (footnote 2), assumed Koc values for naphthalene 15 (Howard 1989) and anthracene (Mackay et al., Volume II) in calculating a Kd range for creosote. 16 4 This constituent has a low octanol/water partition coefficient indicating that its adsorption to soil would be low (Howard, 17 Volume II, 1990) 18 Chapter 5.33

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 6.0 PROCEDURES TO PREVENT HAZARDS 2 This chapter discusses security, inspection schedules, preparedness and prevention requirements, 3 preventive procedures, structures, equipment, and prevention of reaction of ignitable, reactive, and 4 incompatible waste at the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF). The requirements in this chapter that 5 address activities involving the receipt and disposal of dangerous waste as defined in WAC 173-303-040 6 shall be applied during the Active Life of the IDF. Active Life of a facility means the period from the 7 initial receipt of dangerous waste at the facility until the department receives certification of final closure 8 (WAC 173-303-040). The requirements of this chapter that do not apply to receipt and disposal of 9 dangerous waste as defined in WAC 173-303-040, shall be implemented by the Permittees during the 10 Pre-Active Life of IDF. Pre-Active Life is not defined in the regulations, but refers to the facility 11 maintenance period between final construction and the start of Active Life. 12 The IDF is designed and will be operated to minimize exposure of the general public and operating 13 personnel to disposed waste. Shielding, contamination control, control of toxic or dangerous material, 14 and safety and security procedures will be used to keep exposure as low as reasonably achievable 15 (ALARA). 16 6.1 Security 17 The following sections describe the security measures, equipment, and warning signs to be used to control 18 entry to the IDF. A discussion of Hanford Facility security is provided in Attachment 33, Section 6.1. 19 6.1.1 Security Procedures and Equipment 20 The following sections describe the 24-hour surveillance system, barrier, and warning signs to be used to 21 provide security and control access to the IDF. 22 6.1.1.1 24-Hour Surveillance System 23 The Hanford Facility is a controlled-access area [refer to Attachment 33, Section 6.1]. 24 6.1.1.2 Barrier and Means to Control Entry 25 Because the IDF is located within the portion of the Hanford Facility controlled by the 24-hour 26 surveillance system, WAC 173-303-310(2)(c) does not apply. 27 6.1.1.3 Warning Signs 28 Signs will be visible from all angles of approach, and legible from a distance of at least 7.6 meters. Each 29 active area used for disposal will be posted with a sign, in English, reading, DANGER-UNA UTHORIZED 30 PERSONNEL KEEP OUT or an equivalent legend. 31 6.1.2 Waiver 32 A waiver of the security procedures and equipment requirements for the IDF was not requested. 33 Therefore, the requirements of WAC 173-303-3 10(1)(a) and (b) are not applicable. 34 6.2 Inspection Plan 35 This section describes the method and schedule for inspections of the IDF. These inspections help to 36 ensure that situations do not exist that might cause or lead to the release of waste to the environment, 37 degradation of safety equipment and/or systems, or that might pose a threat to human health. Abnormal 38 conditions identified by inspections must be corrected. 39 6.2.1 General Inspection Requirements 40 The content and frequency of inspections are described in this section. Inspection discrepancies are 41 documented on inspection checklists and log sheets. The schedule and inspection records will be kept in 42 the inspection logbooks and retained by the IDF operations personnel. Inspection records will be retained 43 in accordance with Permit Condition 11.1.1 and contain the following information: Chapter 6.5

--- Page 746 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 * Date and time of inspection. 2 * Printed name and the hand written signature of the inspector. 3 * Notation of the observations made. 4 * An account of spills or discharges in accordance with WAC 173-303-145. 5 * Date and nature of any repairs or remedial actions taken. 6 The inspection checklists consist of a listing of items that are assessed during each inspection. A yes/no 7 response will be made for each listed item. A 'yes' response means that the item is in compliance with the 8 conditions stated on the checklist. Any problems identified during the inspection, as indicated by a 'no' 9 response on the checklist, will be reported immediately to the IDF operations supervisor. 10 6.2.1.1 Types of Problems 11 Types of problems looked for during an inspection in Pre-Active Life are in Table 6.2. Types of 12 problems looked for during an inspection in Active Life are in Table 6.3. Once the IDF begins to receive 13 dangerous waste, the requirements in Table 6.2 are no longer applicable. Each day mixed waste 14 containers and/or bulk waste are handled within the IDF; an operator will perform a daily inspection of 15 areas subject to spills (e.g., loading and unloading areas and waste handling areas). 16 6.2.1.2 Frequency of Inspections 17 Table 6.2 provides inspection frequencies during the Pre-Active Life. Tables 6.1, 6., and 6.3 provide 18 inspection frequencies during the Active Life. For clarification, areas with operations that may result in 19 spills are described below 20 Each step in the waste placement operation occurs in the landfill over the double High Density 21 Polyethylene (HDPE) liner system that provides containment of any spill from the waste handling 22 operation. 23 Waste Handling Operations involve the following: 24 * Unloading of the waste shipment in the landfill Placement of the cover soil over the waste 25 container 26 During Active Life leachate,1 movement occurs within the double-contained leachate handling 27 system. There is a potential for a leachate spill on the concrete containment slab of the Crest Pad 28 Building, Leachate Transfer Building, and/or the Leachate Loading Truck Pad. 29 Leachate Handling Operations involve the following: 30 * Pumping leachate from the collection sumps to the Crest Pad Building. 31 * Activities within the Crest Pad Building. 32 * Transfer of leachate to and from the double-lined Leachate Tanks. 33 * All activities that occur in the Leachate Transfer Building. 34 * Pumping of leachate to a tanker truck on the Truck Loading Pad. 35 Liquid handling operations involve the following: 36 * The Secondary Leak Detection System (SLDS) is similar to the Leak Detection System (LDS), 37 except that it is equipped with liquid level indication instrumentation only. A low-capacity 38 submersible pump can be inserted into the SLDS sump if required. Pumping of liquid from the 39 collection sump to the small, portable container on the SLDS Pad may be required. Collected 40 liquid in the SLDS that may be construction water and/or liquid from other sources. WAC 173-303-040 defines "Leachate" as any liquid, including any components suspended in the liquid that has percolated through or drained from dangerous waste. Chapter 6.6

--- Page 747 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I (Note that the secondary leak detection system is not a design requirement of WAC 173-303-665, 2 however United States Department of Energy (DOE) has added the design feature pursuant to its 3 authority under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) and not for the purposes of compliance with the 4 dangerous waste regulations. Therefore, information regarding the design, construction, and operation of 5 the SLDS is provided for information only. Pursuant to AEA, DOE has sole and exclusive responsibility 6 and authority to regulate the source, special nuclear and by-product material component of radioactive 7 mixed waste at DOE-owned nuclear facilities. Source, special nuclear and by-product materials, as 8 defined by AEA, are not subject to regulation under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) or 9 the Hazardous Waste Management Act, by the State of Washington and are not be subject to State 10 dangerous waste permit, orders, or any other enforceable instrument issued there under. DOE recognizes 11 that radionuclide data may be useful in the development and confirmation of geohydrologic conceptual 12 models. Radionuclide data contained herein is therefore provided as a matter of comity so the 13 information may be used for such purposes). 14 6.2.2 Schedule for Remedial Action for Problems Revealed 15 The operating organization will remedy any problems revealed by the inspection on a schedule that 16 prevents hazards to human health and the environment. Where a hazard is imminent or already has 17 occurred immediate action will be taken. Immediate actions will be implemented based on ALARA 18 considerations, availability of supplies, equipment, and personnel. 19 6.2.3 Specific Process or Waste Type Inspection Requirements 20 The following sections detail the inspections to be performed at the IDF. 21 6.2.3.1 Container Inspection 22 On receipt, operations personnel will confirm appropriate documentation by inspecting each mixed 23 wasted container for disposal and compliance with the container receipt inspection criteria (Chapter 3.0) 24 before the mixed waste is placed in the IDF. 25 If present, off-specification waste and vitrified waste requiring cooling in storage will be subject to the 26 specific items and/or problems noted during weekly container inspection (Table 6.1) include the 27 following: 28 * Condition of trench floor and sides. 29 * Container structural integrity. 30 * Containers closed. 31 * At a minimum, 76.2 centimeters aisle spacing. 32 * Corrosion of containers. 33 * Evidence of spills or leaks. 34 * Container labels and markings in place, legible, and unobscured. 35 * Areas in and around stored waste are free of combustibles (e.g., tumbleweeds). 36 * Waste separations such as tape, rope, chain or other cordon mechanism are intact. 37 If present, transport vehicles containing off specification waste or vitrified waste requiring cooling will be 38 subject to the specific items and/or problems noted during weekly inspection include the following: 39 * Transport vehicle structural integrity. 40 * At a minimum, 76.2 centimeters aisle spacing between transporters. 41 * Evidence of spills or leaks. 42 * Areas in and around transport vehicles are free of combustibles (e.g. tumbleweeds). 43 * Separations such as tape, rope, chain or other cordon mechanism are intact. Chapter 6.7

--- Page 748 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility I Transport vehicles will not be subject to an individual container inspection within the transporter. 2 Records of inspection will be maintained as detailed in Section 6.2.1. 3 6.2.3.2 Landfill Inspection 4 The IDF will be inspected according to the frequencies in Table 6.2 during Pre-Active Life and in 5 accordance with Table 6.3 during Active Life. 6 6.2.3.2.1 Run-on and Runoff Control System 7 A run-on control system is installed around the perimeter of each lined trench (Chapter 4.0). The system 8 consists of a berm along the outer margin of each trench that prevents run-on from entering the trench. 9 All run-on control system berms are inspected quarterly (Table 6.2) and after storms for signs of 10 deterioration, malfunction, or improper operation. During Active Life, any precipitation that falls 11 between the run-on control berm and the edge of the trench excavation eventually might flow into the 12 primary leachate control and removal system sump and will be treated as leachate. 13 6.2.3.2.2 Leak Detection System 14 During pre-active life, the leak detection system will be monitored quarterly and after storms (Table 6.2) 15 for the amount of liquid removed. To calculate the action leakage rate, measurements are needed to be 16 collected over five consecutive days each quarter. The action leakage rate will be determined for the 17 quarter using these measurements collected during one five day work week each quarter. 18 During Active life (Table 6.3), leak detection for lined trench at the IDF is accomplished by the 19 following: 20 * Monitoring liquid level above the secondary liner. 21 * Monitoring liquid levels above primary liner. 22 * Inspecting for the presence of liquids after significant precipitation events. 23 * Verifying certain gauges and instruments are in current calibration; calibration is performed 24 annually or more frequently at intervals suggested by the manufacturer (Chapter 4.0, 25 Section 4.3.7.4). 26 * Recording secondary sump levels on a daily action leakage rate calculation sheet (Figure 6.1). 27 If the action leakage rate (Chapter 4.0, Appendix 4C) has not been exceeded, the liner system will be 28 functioning properly. 29 6.2.3.2.3 Wind Dispersal Control System 30 During pre-active life, berms will be inspected quarterly and after storms to ensure the berms are 31 functioning properly (Table 6.2). 32 During active life (Table 6.3), waste is inspected on receipt for evidence of damage, corrosion, or 33 deterioration that might lead to dispersal of the contents. 34 Unpackaged or bulk waste with any potential for wind dispersal is covered or sprayed with fixative after 35 being placed in a trench. 36 In addition, unpackaged or bulk waste handling operations are suspended in winds exceeding 37 24 kilometers per hour unless specifically approved by operations supervisors. The supervisor only 38 would grant approval to operate in winds over 24 kilometers per hour after determining that the risk to 39 human health or the environment would be diminished by completing the work activity, or that the nature 40 and form of the waste handling activity was such that the wind speed would have no significant impact. 41 6.2.3.2.4 Leachate Collection and Removal System 42 During pre-active life, the Leachate Collection and Removal System is inspected quarterly and after 43 storms (Table 6.2) for the presence of liquids, and that the system is functioning properly. Chapter 6.8

--- Page 749 ---
WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 During active-life (Table 6.3), Liquids in the Leachate Collection and Removal System and Leak 2 Detection System are monitored daily to ensure the action leakage rate (Chapter 4.0, Appendix 4A) is not 3 exceeded and will be inspected per Table 6.2. In addition, a flow meter is used to check if the amount of 4 actual leachate pumped corresponds to the amount accumulated in the leachate collection tank. This 5 check will verify the proper function of the leachate collection and removal sump pumps with each use. 6 6.3 Preparedness and Prevention Requirements 7 Section 6.3.1 describes the preparedness and prevention measures to be implemented during Pre-Active 8 Life. Sections 6.3.2 through 6.3.7 describe the preparedness and prevention measures taken at the IDF 9 during Active Life. 10 6.3.1 Pre-Active Life Preparedness and Prevention 11 During Pre-Active Life, the Permittees will comply with Permit Attachment 4, Hanford Emergency 12 Management Plan (DOE/RL-94-02) as applicable for a facility that does not contain dangerous waste. An 13 emergency coordinator will be assigned to IDF who will manage and control all aspects of the initial 14 facility response when an emergency occurs. 15 6.3.2 Equipment Requirements 16 The following sections describe the internal and external communications systems and the emergency 17 equipment required. 18 6.3.3 Internal Communication 19 There is one building, MO-518, equipped to support communications. Immediate emergency instruction 20 to personnel working at the IDF will be provided by cellular telephones. 21 6.3.4 External Communications 22 Personnel at the IDF will have voice communication or equivalent (e.g., hand signals) during work 23 assignments to maintain external communications with shift supervisors. Supervision will contact the 24 Hanford Facility emergency telephone number (911) (373-3800 for cellular telephones) if assistance is 25 needed in the field. 26 6.3.5 Emergency Equipment 27 Emergency equipment will be available for use at the IDF. A list of equipment is included in the 28 contingency plan (Addendum J. 1, Pre-Active Life, and Addendum J.2, Active Life). 29 The Hanford Facility relies primarily on the Hanford Fire Department to control fires. Emergency 30 equipment will not be located at IDF trenches. Portable fire extinguishers will be carried on IDF 31 operations vehicles. Attachment 4, Hanford Emergency Management Plan, (DOE/RL-94-02) identifies 32 the trained firefighting and emergency medical personnel and equipment. 33 6.3.6 Water for Fire Control 34 * Hanford Fire Department trucks as described in Permit Attachment 4, Hanford Emergency 35 Management Plan, (DOE/RL-94-02); and fire hydrants described in Addendum J.1 and 36 Addendum J.2 supply water for fire control at the IDF. 37 6.3.7 Aisle Spacing Requirements for Off-Specification Waste 38 Aisle spacing during off-specification and cooling vitrified waste storage operations is sufficient to allow 39 the movement of personnel and fire protection equipment in and around the containers. This aisle spacing 40 meets the requirements of WAC 173-303-340(3). Inspection aisle space must be at least 76.2 centimeters. 41 During off-specification storage operations, rows of containers are placed no more than two containers 42 wide in accordance with WAC 173-303-630(5)(c). Aisle spacing requirements will be applied to 43 transport vehicles but not to the waste within the transport vehicles. Chapter 6.9

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 6.4 Preventive Procedures, Structures, and Equipment 2 The following sections will apply during the Active Life for the IDF and describe preventive procedures, 3 structures, and equipment. 4 6.4.1 Unloading Operations 5 Methods used to prevent release of waste during unloading operations will be employed as follows. 6 * Waste will be inspected according to the receipt inspection criteria (Chapter 3.0). 7 o If waste fails the inspection, it will be designated as an off-specification waste and could be 8 placed in the storage area or returned to the generator. 9 * Containers and bulk waste will be handled by appropriate equipment (i.e., crane) during 10 unloading. 11 * Path from loading area to trench area will be clear of obstructions. 12 Spills will be managed as identified in the contingency plan (Addendum J.2). 13 Containers and bulk waste will be staged at the waste unloading area no longer than necessary for 14 placement into the landfill. Administrative procedures may prevent immediate unloading and backfilling 15 of waste containers. Containers might be left in the transporters as needed to resolve the administrative 16 procedure requirements or to support the operational schedule before containers are placed into the 17 landfill. The transfer vehicle containing vitrified waste requiring cooling may be temporarily placed in 18 the storage area prior to unloading for disposal. 19 6.4.2 Runoff 20 The waste in the IDF will be placed below the land surface; thus, the IDF is designed to prevent run-off of 21 precipitation that might have come in contact with the waste. The land surface is relatively level, so 22 trenches have only internal drainage. The minimal amounts of precipitation that accumulate are 23 contained within the trench. 24 The IDF trench is designed to channel run-on liquid away from the trench. Precipitation that percolates to 25 the bottom of the trench is captured in the leachate collection system and is managed as rainwater during 26 Pre Active Life. During Active Life, these liquids will be managed as multi-source leachate waste. 27 6.4.3 Water Supplies 28 The design and operation of the IDF during Active Life is intended to minimize the generation of 29 potentially contaminated leachate and to prevent leachate migration into groundwater resources in the 30 local area. All activities performed during Active Life (Chapter 4.0) or Pre-active Life is designed to 31 protect local water supplies. 32 Activities that prevent contamination of water supplies or groundwater will include the following: 33 * Placement of waste in lined trenches 34 o Run-on and run-off will be controlled 35 o Leak detection systems will be used 36 o Leachate will be collected and managed as waste 37 o Inspections will be performed 38 * Placement of backfill will occur after a layer of waste has been placed in the trench. 39 6.4.4 Equipment and Power Failure 40 Electrical power is required for the landfill. Electricity supplies power to the sump pumps used to remove 41 accumulated leachate from the primary and secondary liners. Electricity outages will be restored as soon 42 as possible. Backup equipment will be acquired if necessary to provide electrical service. Failed 43 equipment will be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. Chapter 6.10

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 6.4.5 Personal Protection Equipment 2 Personnel will be trained in the use of applicable personal protection equipment. The protective clothing 3 required for Active Life will vary depending on the form and content of the waste. 4 6.5 Prevention of Reaction of Ignitable, Reactive, and Incompatible Waste 5 The waste acceptance criteria will prohibit the disposal of ignitable, reactive, and incompatible waste at 6 the IDF. Waste acceptance criteria (Chapter 3.0) will ensure that the required treatment has been 7 performed before the waste is disposed in the IDF. 8 Waste stream compatibility (i.e., compatibility between individual waste streams and compatibility 9 between waste streams and landfill design and construction parameters) will be assessed on a case-by- 10 case basis. Criteria for assessing and determining compatibility will be identified in either the facility 11 Waste Acceptance Criteria, Waste Analysis Plan, or other protocol or procedure as appropriate 12 (Chapter 3.0) for further discussion of waste stream compatibility. 13 Chapter 6.11

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 8.0 PERSONNEL TRAINING [H] 2 This chapter discusses personnel training requirements based on WAC 173-303 and the Hanford Facility 3 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Permit (Permit). Permit Condition II.C (Personnel 4 Training), contains training requirements applicable to Hanford Facility personnel and non-Facility 5 personnel. Compliance with these requirements at the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF) is demonstrated 6 by information contained in Permit Attachment 5, and this chapter. This chapter supplements Permit 7 Attachment 5. 8 8.1 Outline of Introductory and Continuing Training Programs [H-2] 9 The introductory and continuing training programs are designed to prepare personnel to manage and 10 maintain the treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) unit in a safe, effective, and environmentally sound 11 manner. In addition to preparing personnel to manage and maintain TSD units under normal conditions, 12 the training programs ensure that personnel are prepared to respond in a prompt and effective manner 13 should abnormal or emergency conditions occur. Emergency response training is consistent with the 14 description of actions contained in Addendum J.1, Contingency Plan, Pre-Active Life. 15 Introductory training includes general Hanford Facility training and TSD unit-specific training. General 16 Hanford Facility training is described in Permit Attachment 5, and is provided in accordance with Permit 17 Condition II.C.2. TSD unit-specific training is provided to Hanford Facility personnel allowing personnel 18 to work unescorted. Hanford Facility personnel cannot perform a task for which they are not properly 19 trained, except to gain required experience while under the direct supervision of a supervisor or coworker 20 who is properly trained. Hanford Facility personnel assigned the job title of Emergency Coordinator and 21 alternates to this position performing tasks described in WAC 173-303-360 (e.g., Building Emergency 22 Directors) are thoroughly familiar with applicable contingency plan documentation, operations, activities, 23 location, and properties of all waste handled, location of all records, and the unit/building layout. 24 Continuing training meets the requirements for WAC 173-303-330(1)(b) and includes general Hanford 25 Facility training and TSD unit-specific training. General Hanford Facility training is the same as 26 described for introductory training. TSD unit-specific training provides an annual review of emergency 27 response training and an annual review of training necessary to ensure TSD unit operations are in 28 compliance with WAC 173-303. 29 8.2 Description of Training Plan 30 In accordance with Permit Condition II.C.3, the unit-specific portion of the Hanford Facility Dangerous 31 Waste Permit Application must contain a description of the training plan. The plan is written to comply 32 with WAC 173-303-330. Written training plan documentation is maintained outside of the Hanford 33 Facility Dangerous Waste Permit Application and the Permit. Therefore, changes made to the written 34 training plan documentation are not subject to the Permit modification process. The training plan will be 35 maintained as part of the operating records of the facility and will be available to regulators upon request. Chapter 8.5

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 11.0 CLOSURE 2 This chapter discusses preclosure, closure, and post closure activities for the Integrated Disposal Facility 3 (IDF). This closure plan complies with WAC 173-303-610 and represents the baseline for closure. 4 The IDF has been constructed on 25 hectares of vacant land southwest of the Plutonium Uranium 5 Extraction Facility (PUREX) Plant in the 200 East Area [see the topographic map on file at the 6 Department of Ecology library (3100 Port of Benton Boulevard, Richland, WA 99354)]. The landfill is 7 segregated into a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) permitted side and a non-RCRA 8 permitted side. The scope of this permit is limited to the western side of the landfill where the RCRA 9 waste will be placed. The waste containers and bulk waste that meet the IDF waste acceptance criteria 10 will be inventoried, and disposed in this lined landfill. Leachate collected from the lined landfill will be 11 transferred to leachate collection tanks located in proximity to the landfill for subsequent treatment. 12 A more detailed discussion of IDF waste types and the identification of the IDF processes and equipment 13 are provided in Chapters 3.0 and 4.0, and attendant appendices. The IDF only will accept and dispose 14 waste containers and bulk waste that meet the IDF waste acceptance criteria, RCRA and Land Disposal 15 Restriction (LDR). 16 The closure process will be the same for partial closure or closure of the entire IDF. The remainder of 17 this chapter describes the performance standards that will be met, and the closure/post closure activities 18 that will be conducted. 19 11.1 Closure Plan 20 Waste containers and bulk waste that meet the IDF waste acceptance criteria will be disposed in the lined 21 landfill that complies with WAC 173-303-665 standards (Chapter 4.0). The IDF will be closed according 22 to current applicable WAC 173-303 regulations, United States Department of Energy (DOE) 23 requirements, best management practices, and will be integrated with the overall cleanup activities 24 performed under the Tri-Party Agreement (HFFACO). 25 The disposal landfill cover will be designed and located to comply with WAC 173-303-665(6) and 26 WAC 173-303-610. The specification and/or variation for other cover designs will be provided at the 27 time of closure once a hazard(s) has been defined. 28 11.2 Closure Performance Standards 29 Closure requirements found in WAC 173-303-665(6), incorporated by reference, and detailed here in 30 Chapter 11.0 of the IDF portion of the permit, will make up the closure performance standards for the 31 IDF. 32 11.3 Preclosure Activities 33 Preclosure activities could include, at a minimum, placing interim or final covers over the filled portions 34 of the landfill as the landfill is expanded to accept more waste. Placement of covers over the filled 35 portions might be deferred until closure of all the IDF. Once a decision is made to construct the final 36 cover over the landfill, a closure cover design will be used that satisfies the dangerous waste disposal 37 requirements defined in WAC 173-303. 38 The selection of a final cover design has not been identified. Figure I1-I shows an example of a typical 39 Hanford Site landfill cover design. Design(s) will include features to satisfy the minimum requirements 40 found in WAC 173-303-665(6). 41 11.4 Maximum Extent of Operation 42 The maximum process design capacity of the IDF conservatively is calculated to be 100 hectare-meters, 43 which is 1,000,000 cubic meters (Chapter 1.0, Part A, Form, Section III). The IDF landfill will be 44 segregated into a RCRA permitted side of 50 hectare-meters and a non-RCRA permitted side of 45 50 hectare-meters. Chapter 11.5

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 11.5 Decontaminating Equipment and Structures 2 All ancillary equipment and its secondary containment, and instrumentation (e.g., level-indicating 3 devices, leak detection devices, pumps, piping) meet the definition of "debris" as defined in 4 WAC 173-303-040. Items in direct contact with mixed waste are assumed to meet the definition of 5 "hazardous debris" as defined in WAC 173-303-040. 6 Currently, three options are available for treating hazardous debris. The first option is to treat the debris 7 using one of the three debris treatment technologies-extraction, destruction, or immobilization-as 8 described in 40 CFR 268.45. If the hazardous debris is treated using approved extraction or destruction 9 technologies, the debris is no longer required to be managed as a dangerous waste as long as the debris 10 does not exhibit a characteristic of a dangerous waste. If hazardous debris contaminated with a listed 11 waste is treated using an immobilization technology, it remains a listed waste, even after the LDR 12 treatment standards are met unless Ecology makes a case-by-case determination that the debris "no longer 13 contains" a mixed waste. In effect, by making this "contained-in" determination on a case-by-case basis, 14 Ecology will be setting clean closure standards in accordance with the closure performance standards of 15 WAC 173-303-610(2)(a)(ii). 16 The second option is to treat the hazardous debris to meet the constituent-specific LDR treatment standard 17 for the waste or waste-specific constituents contaminating the debris; however, such debris, even after 18 treatment, may be considered a dangerous waste under the dangerous waste regulations and may require 19 management at a facility permitted to manage dangerous waste. 20 The third option involves obtaining a "contained-in determination" for the hazardous debris, thereby 21 rendering the waste "non-hazardous" for those waste-specific-listed constituents that fall below Model 22 Toxic Control Act (MTCA) method B risk-based health limits. Moreover, it must be proven that the 23 debris does not designate as a characteristic waste under WAC-173-303. 24 11.5.1 Contaminated Soil 25 Contaminated soil could be generated as a result of spill cleanup. Since the majority of IDF operations 26 will be performed within secondary containment (see Chapters 4.0 and 6.0) the potential for spilling 27 dangerous waste into the surrounding soil is low. Contaminated soil generated as a result of a dangerous 28 waste spill will be managed pursuant to WAC-173-303-200. 29 Once the soil is designated, appropriate treatment and disposal or storage options will be determined and 30 implemented. 31 A contained-in determination could also be sought for contaminated soil generated as a result of a spill. 32 For contaminated media the contained-in policy requires that a statistically based sampling plan be used 33 for obtaining the data to support a contained-in demonstration. The contained-in policy does not require 34 that the waste be analytically nondetectable for it to be considered nondangerous. However, the 35 analytical results must prove that the listed constituents in the soil are below health-based limits as 36 provided in WAC 173-303-610(2)(b)(i) and that the soil does not exhibit any dangerous waste 37 characteristics (i.e., soil does not designate for D codes). If approved by Ecology, this could allow waste 38 that falls below specific health-based levels to be disposed of without requiring treatment 39 11.6 Closure of Landfill Units 40 Closure of the IDF will be consistent with the closure requirements specified in WAC-173-303-665(6) 41 and WAC 173-303-610. The cover design(s) will satisfy the requirements of WAC 173-303-665(6). 42 11.6.1 Cover Design 43 The cover could consist of several layers constructed on top of a native soil base. A generalized 44 cross-section of an example cover is shown on Figure I 1-1. It is assumed that before construction of the 45 final cover, the waste form would be stabilized appropriately. Chapter 11.6

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 11.6.1.1 Grade Layer 2 The surface of the landfill would be graded and/or shaped, if necessary, to match the slope of the desired 3 low-permeability layer. Additional soil would be placed over the landfill to achieve the required cover 4 grade. This grade layer could taper from zero thickness near the edge of the cover boundary to perhaps 5 several meters at the center of the cover; the thickness would depend on the lateral dimensions of the 6 particular cover and the grade of the cover. 7 11.6.1.2 Low-Permeability Layer 8 The selection of an appropriate material for this layer would be based on the hazard that is to be isolated. 9 The low-permeability layer will be the primary barrier in preventing soil and/or water from migrating into 10 the waste zone and meet WAC 173-303-655(6)(v) "Have a permeability less than or equal to the 11 permeability of any bottom liner system or natural sub soils present". 12 11.6.1.3 Drainage Layer 13 The drainage layer would conduct any water that percolates through the overlying layers laterally to the 14 drainage ditch. Thus, the drainage layer would prevent hydraulic pressure from building up directly on 15 the low-permeability liner, and thereby eliminate one set of forces that would drive moisture through the 16 primary moisture control barrier. 17 11.6.1.4 Plant, Animal, and Human Intrusion Layer (optional) 18 The performance objectives for the permanent isolation surface barrier are summarized as follows: 19 * Function in a semiarid to sub-humid environment. 20 * Limit the recharge of water through the waste to near zero amounts [0.05 centimeter per year 21 (1.6x109 centimeters per second)]. 22 * Be maintenance free. 23 * Minimize the likelihood of plant, animal, and human intrusion. 24 * Limit the exhalation of noxious gases. 25 * Minimize erosion-related problems. 26 * Meet or exceed WAC 173-303-665(6) cover performance requirements. 27 * Isolate waste for 1,000 years. 28 To satisfy the intrusion performance objective, an optional layer would be included in the design of 29 barriers that require the additional human and/or biointrusion protection to reduce either the 30 environmental or human health risk. 31 11.6.1.5 Graded Filter Layer 32 A graded filter consisting of crushed rock overlaid by sand would be placed on the plant, animal, and 33 human intrusion layer if incorporated into the design, or directly over the drainage layer. The graded 34 filter would serve to separate the surface soil layer from the drainage layer. A geotextile would be placed 35 on the top of the graded filter to decrease the potential for fine material to enter the filter and drainage 36 zone. The geotextile would be permeable, allowing drainage, and would not support a standing head of 37 water. 38 11.6.1.6 Surface Soil Layer 39 The two most important factors in engineering the surface soil thickness would be the assignment of the 40 water retention characteristics for soil and climate information. Surface soil would be placed over the 41 geotextile to intercept, store, recycle water, and prevent damage to the underlying structure from natural 42 and synthetic processes. Chapter 11.7

WA7890008967 Integrated Disposal Facility 1 11.6.1.7 Vegetative Cover 2 The vegetative cover would perform three functions. First, the plants would return water stored in the 3 surface soil back to the atmosphere, significantly decreasing net infiltration and reducing the amount of 4 moisture available to penetrate the cover. Second, the vegetation would stabilize the surface soil 5 component of the cover against wind and water erosion. Finally, the vegetative cover would restore the 6 appearance of the land to a more natural condition and appearance. 7 A mixture of seeds would be used to establish vegetation. The seed types would be selected based on 8 resistance to drought, rooting density, and ability to extract water. 9 11.6.2 Wind Erosion 10 The principal hazard associated with wind erosion is the thinning of the cover surface soil layer. This in 11 turn potentially could lead to breaching of the moisture barriers, gradually allowing larger quantities of 12 water to reach the waste. The engineering approaches to mitigating wind erosion of the cover would be 13 (1) designing the surface soil layer with an appropriate total thickness to compensate for future soil loss 14 that might result from wind erosion, (2) establishing a vegetative cover on the surface to reduce wind 15 erosion, and (3) including an appropriate coarse material (admix) in the upper layer of the surface soil to 16 form an armor layer. 17 11.6.3 Water Erosion 18 The potential hazard associated with water erosion is the same as that for wind erosion, namely the loss of 19 soil from the top or surface layer. 20 Several of the following engineering approaches could be adopted to minimize the potential for water 21 erosion: 22 * Limiting the surface slopes. 23 * Providing run-on control with the sideslope drainage ditches. 24 * Compacting the surface soil in a way that promotes significant infiltration rather than excessive 25 run-off. 26 * Properly designing the sideslopes to prevent gullying. 27 * Establishing a vegetative cover to slow surface run-off. 28 * Incorporating coarse material (pea gravel admix) in the upper portion of the surface soil layer to 29 help form an erosion-resistant armor. 30 * Limiting flow path lengths through the use of vegetation and admix. 31 The cover design would be evaluated for potential erosion damage from overall soil erodibility, sheet 32 flow, and gullying. 33 11.6.4 Deep-Rooted Plants 34 The following design features could minimize the potential for problems with deep-rooted plants. 35 * The surface soil (top two layers) would retain most of the precipitation, because the underlying 36 drainage layer would have significantly higher permeability and much less water retention 37 capacity. Therefore, it is expected that vegetation preferentially would occupy the surface soil 38 layer and not have an affinity for growing into the drier underlying layers. 39 * The thickness of the surface soils would be sized to promote the development of semiarid 40 deep-rooted perennial grasses and to discourage the development of deep-rooting intrusive 41 species.

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 PERMIT CONDITIONS 2 LIQUID EFFLUENT RETENTION FACILITY & 200 AREA EFFLUENT TREATMENT FACILITY 3 UNIT DESCRIPTION 4 The Liquid Effluent Retention Facility (LERF) and 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility(200 Area ETF) 5 consists of an aqueous waste treatment system that provides treatment, storage integral to the treatment 6 process, and storage of secondary wastes from the treatment process for a variety of aqueous mixed 7 waste. The 200 Area ETF is located in the 200 East Area. Aqueous wastes managed by the 200 Area 8 ETF include process condensate from the LERF and 200 Area ETF and other aqueous waste generated 9 from onsite remediation and waste management activities. 10 The LERF consists of three lined surface impoundments, or basins. Aqueous waste from LERF is 11 pumped to the 200 Area ETF for treatment in a series of process units, or systems, that remove or destroy 12 essentially all of the dangerous waste constituents. The treated effluent is discharged to a State-Approved 13 Land Disposal Site (SALDS) north of the 200 West Area, under the authority of a Washington State 14 Waste Discharge Permit (Ecology 2000) and 200 Area ETF Delisting (40 Code of Federal Regulations 15 (CFR) 261, Appendix IX, Table 2). Construction of the LERF began in 1990. Waste management 16 operations began at LERF in April 1994. Construction of the 200 Area ETF began in 1992. Waste 17 management operations began at 200 Area ETF in November of 1995. 18 This Chapter provides unit-specific Permit conditions applicable to the dangerous waste management 19 units for LERF and 200 Area ETF. 20 LIST OF ADDENDA SPECIFIC TO OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 21 Addendum A Part A Form, dated March 31, 2015 22 Addendum B Waste Analysis Plan, dated June 30, 2015 23 Addendum C Process Information, dated December 31, 2014 24 Addendum D Groundwater Monitoring, approved April 29, 2014 25 Addendum E Security Requirements, dated, June 30, 2011 26 Addendum F Preparedness and Prevention, dated April 8, 2014 27 Addendum G Personnel Training, dated June 30, 2015 28 Addendum H Closure Plan, dated June 30, 2011 29 Addendum I Inspection Requirements, dated April 8, 2014 30 Addendum J Contingency Plan, dated June 30, 2015 31 DEFINITIONS 32 State and federal delisting actions: The state delisting action pursuant to Washington Administrative 33 Code (WAC) 173-303-910(3), August 8, 2005, and the federal delisting action appearing in 40 CFR 261, 34 Appendix IX, Table 2 applicable to the United States, Department of Energy, Richland, Washington. 35 ACRONYMS 36 LERF and 200 Area ETF 200-Area Liquids Processing Facility 37 Conditions.3

Nature of Business (provide a brief description that Includes both dangerous waste and non-dangerous waste areas and activities) Construction of the Liquid Effluent Retention Facility (LERF) began in 1990. Waste management operations began at LERF in April 1994. Construction of the 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility (ETF) began in 1992. Waste management operations began at ETF in November of 1995. The LERF and ETF comprise an aqueous waste treatment system located in the 200 East Area that provides storage and treatment for a variety of aqueous mixed waste. This aqueous waste includes process condensate from the 242-A Evaporator and other aqueous waste generated from onsite remediation and waste management activities. The LERF consists of three lined surface impoundments, or basins. Aqueous waste from LERF is pumped to the ETF for treatment in a series of process units, or systems, that remove or destroy dangerous waste constituents. The treated effluent is discharged to a State-Approved Land Disposal Site (SALDS) north of the 200 West Area, under the authority of a Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (ST4500) and the Final Delisting (40 CFR 261, Appendix IX, Table 2) Sludge that accumulates in the bottoms of ETF process tanks is removed periodically and placed into containers. The waste is solidified by decanting the supernate from the container and the remainder of the liquid is allowed to evaporate, or absorbents are added, as necessary, to address the residual liquid. The process design capacity for treatment of waste in containers (TO4) is 18,927 liters per day. ECY 030-31 Hanford (Rev. 3/5/04) of 16

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I B.1 Introduction 2 In accordance with the regulations set forth in the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) 3 Dangerous Waste Regulations, Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173-303-300, this waste 4 analysis plan (WAP) has been prepared for operation of the Liquid Effluent Retention Facility (LERF) 5 and the 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility (200 Area ETF) located in the 200 East Area on the Hanford 6 Site, Richland, Washington. 7 The purpose of this WAP is to ensure that adequate knowledge as defined in WAC 173-303-040, is 8 obtained for dangerous and/or mixed waste accepted by and managed in LERF and 200 Area ETF. This 9 WAP documents the sampling and analytical methods, and describes the procedures used to obtain this 10 knowledge. This WAP also documents the requirements for generators sending aqueous waste to the 11 LERF or 200 Area ETF for treatment. Throughout this WAP, the term generator includes any Hanford 12 Site source, including treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) units, whose process produces an aqueous 13 waste. 14 LERF consists of three surface impoundments, which provide treatment and storage. The 200 Area ETF 15 includes a tank system, which provides treatment and storage, and a container management area, which 16 provides container storage and treatment. Additionally, this WAP discusses the sampling and analytical 17 methods for the treated effluent (treated aqueous waste) that is discharged from 200 Area ETF as a 18 non-dangerous, delisted waste to the State Approved Land Disposal Site (SALDS). Specifically, the 19 WAP contains sampling and analysis requirements including quality assurance/quality control 20 requirements, for the following: 21 * Influent Waste Acceptance Process -determines the acceptability of a particular aqueous waste 22 at the LERF or 200 Area ETF pursuant to applicable Permit conditions, regulatory requirements, 23 and operating capabilities prior to acceptance of the waste at the LERF or 200 Area ETF for 24 treatment or storage. This includes documenting that wastes accepted for treatment at ETF are 25 within the treatability envelope required by the Final Delisting 200 Area ETF, Permit Condition 26 1.a.i. Refer to Section B.2. 27 * Special Management Requirements -identifies the special management requirements for 28 aqueous wastes managed in the LERF or 200 Area ETF. Refer to Section B.3. 29 * Influent Aqueous Waste Sampling and Analysis -describes influent sampling and analyses 30 used to characterize an influent aqueous waste to ensure proper management of the waste and for 31 compliance with the special management requirements. Also includes rationale for analyses. 32 Refer to Section B.4. 33 * Treated Effluent Sampling and Analysis -describes sampling and analyses of treated effluent 34 (i.e., treated aqueous waste) for compliance with Washington State Waste Discharge Permit, 35 No. ST 4500 (Ecology 2000); and Final Delisting 200 Area ETF 40 CFR 261, Appendix IX, 36 Table 2 and the corresponding State Final Delisting issued pursuant to WAC 173-303-910(3) 37 limits. Also includes rationale for analyses. Refer to Section B.5. 38 * 200 Area ETF Generated Waste Sampling and Analysis -describes the sampling and analyses 39 used to characterize the secondary waste streams generated from the treatment process and to 40 characterize waste generated from maintenance and operations activities. Also includes rationale 41 for analyses. Characterization and designation of wastes generated from maintenance and 42 operations activities are conducted pursuant to WAC 173-303-170 and are not subject to the 43 permit requirements of WAC 173-303-800. These descriptions are included in this WAP for 44 purposes of completeness, but are not enforceable conditions of this WAP or the permit. Refer to 45 Section B.6. 46 * Quality Assurance and Quality Control -ensures the accuracy and precision of sampling and 47 analysis activities. Refer to Section B.7. Addendum B.6

--- Page 820 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I This WAP meets the specific requirements of the following: 2 * Land Disposal Restrictions Treatment Exemption for the LERF under 40 CFR 268.4, 3 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), December 6, 1994 (EPA 1994). 4 * Final Delisting 200 Area ETF [40 CFR 261, Appendix IX, Table 2. 5 * Corresponding State Final Delisting issued pursuant to WAC 173-303-910(3). 6 * Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500), as amended. 7 * Hanford Facility Dangerous Waste Permit (Permit) WA7890008967, as amended. 8 The Permit conditions of the Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500) are included in 9 this WAP for completeness, as well as generator requirements for designation of wastes generated by 10 LERF and 200 Area ETF from operation and maintenance activities. The Washington State Waste 11 Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500) Conditions are not within the scope of Resource Conservation and 12 Recovery Act (RCRA) or WAC 173-303 or subject to the permit requirements of WAC 173-303-800. 13 Therefore, revisions of this WAP that are not governed by the requirements of WAC 173-303 will not be 14 considered as a modification subject to review or approval by Ecology. Any other revisions to this WAP 15 will be incorporated through the Permit modification process as necessary to demonstrate compliance 16 with requirements of this Permit, including Permit Conditions I.E.7 and I.E.8. 17 B.1.1 Liquid Effluent Retention Facility and Effluent Treatment Facility Description 18 The LERF and 200 Area ETF comprise an aqueous waste treatment system located in the 200 East Area. 19 Both LERF and 200 Area ETF may receive aqueous waste through several inlets. 200 Area ETF can 20 receive aqueous waste through three inlets. First, 200 Area ETF can receive aqueous waste directly from 21 the LERF. Second, aqueous waste can be transferred from the Load-in Station to 200 Area ETF. Third, 22 aqueous waste can be transferred from containers (e.g., carboys, drums) to the 200 Area ETF through 23 either the Secondary Waste Receiving Tanks or the Concentrate Tanks. The Load-in Station is located 24 just east of 200 Area ETF and currently consists of three storage tanks and a pipeline that connects to 25 either LERF or 200 Area ETF through fiberglass pipelines with secondary containment. 26 The LERF can receive aqueous waste through four inlets. First, aqueous waste can be transferred to 27 LERF through a dedicated pipeline from the 200 West Area. Second, aqueous waste can be transferred 28 through a pipeline that connects LERF with the 242-A Evaporator. Third, aqueous waste also can be 29 transferred to LERF from a pipeline that connects LERF to the Load-in Station at 200 Area ETF. Finally, 30 aqueous waste can be transferred into LERF through a series of sample ports located at each basin. 31 The LERF consists of three lined surface impoundments with a nominal capacity of 29.5 million liters 32 each. Aqueous waste from LERF is pumped to 200 Area ETF through a double walled fiberglass 33 pipeline. The pipeline is equipped with leak detection located in the annulus between the inner and outer 34 pipes. Each basin is equipped with six available sample risers constructed of 6-inch-perforated pipe. A 35 seventh sample riser in each basin is dedicated to influent waste receipt piping, and an eighth riser in each 36 basin contains liquid level instrumentation. Each riser extends along the sides of each basin from the top 37 to the bottom of the basin. Detailed information on the construction and operation of the LERF is 38 provided in Addendum C, Process Information. 39 200 Area ETF is designed to treat the contaminants anticipated in process condensate from the 40 242-A Evaporator and other aqueous wastes from the Hanford Site. Section B.1.2 provides more 41 information on the sources of these wastes. 42 The capabilities of 200 Area ETF were confirmed through pilot plant testing. A pilot plant was used to 43 test surrogate solutions that contained constituents of concern anticipated in aqueous wastes on the 44 Hanford Site. The pilot plant testing served as the basis for a demonstration of the treatment capabilities 45 of 200 Area ETF in the 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility Delisting Petition (DOE/RL-92-72). 46 200 Area ETF consists of a primary and a secondary treatment train (Figure B.1). The primary treatment 47 train removes or destroys dangerous and mixed waste components from the aqueous waste. Addendum B.7

--- Page 821 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I In the secondary treatment train, the waste components are concentrated and dried into a powder. This 2 waste is containerized, and transferred to a waste treatment, storage, and/or disposal (TSD) unit. 3 Each treatment train consists of a series of operations. The primary treatment train includes the 4 following: 5 * Surge tank 6 * Filtration 7 * Ultraviolet light oxidation (UV/OX) 8 * pH adjustment 9 * Hydrogen peroxide decomposition 10 * Degasification 11 * Reverse osmosis (RO) 12 * Ion exchange 13 * Final pH adjustment and verification 14 The secondary treatment train uses the following: 15 * Secondary waste receiving 16 * Evaporation (with mechanical vapor recompression) 17 * Concentrate staging 18 * Thin film drying 19 * Container handling 20 * Supporting systems 21 A dry powder waste is generated from the secondary treatment train, from the treatment of an aqueous 22 waste. The secondary waste treatment system typically receives and processes by-products generated 23 from the primary treatment train. However, in an alternate operating scenario, some aqueous wastes may 24 be fed to the secondary treatment train before the primary treatment train. 25 The treated effluent is contained in verification tanks where the effluent is sampled to confirm that the 26 effluent meets the delisting criteria. Under 40 CFR 261, Appendix IX, Table 2, the treated effluent from 27 200 Area ETF is considered a delisted waste; that is, the treated effluent is no longer a listed dangerous 28 waste subject to the hazardous waste management requirements of RCRA provided that the delisting 29 criteria are satisfied and the treated effluent does not exhibit a dangerous characteristic. The treated 30 effluent is discharged under the Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500) as a 31 nondangerous, delisted waste to the SALDS, located in the 600 Area, north of the 200 West Area. A 32 portion of the treated wastewater from the Verification Tanks is recycled as service water throughout the 33 facility; for example, it is used to dilute bulk acid and caustic to meet processing needs, thereby reducing 34 the demand for process water. 35 B.1.2 Sources of Aqueous Waste 36 200 Area ETF was intended and designed to treat a variety of mixed wastes. However, process 37 condensate from the 242-A Evaporator was the only mixed waste initially identified for storage and 38 treatment in the LERF and 200 Area ETF. As cleanup activities at Hanford progress, many of the 39 aqueous wastes generated from site remediation and waste management activities are sent to the LERF 40 and 200 Area ETF for treatment and storage. A brief discussion of waste streams that may be managed 41 by LERF and 200 Area ETF in the future may be found in the 200 Area ETF Delisting Petition 42 (DOE/RL-92-97). Addendum B.8

--- Page 822 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 Prior to management of any new waste streams, it may be necessary to modify this WAP through the 2 permit modification process to ensure that adequate knowledge of such new waste streams is available 3 prior to management of them in LERF and 200 Area ETF. 4 The 242-A process condensate is a dangerous waste because it is derived from a listed, dangerous waste 5 stored in the Double-Shell Tank (DST) System. The DST waste is transferred to the 242-A Evaporator 6 where the waste is concentrated through an evaporation process. The concentrated slurry waste is 7 returned to the DST System, and the evaporated portion of the waste is recondensed, collected, and 8 transferred as process condensate to the LERF. 9 Other aqueous wastes that are treated and stored at the LERF and 200 Area ETF include, but are not 10 limited to the following Hanford wastes: 11 * Contaminated groundwater from pump-and-treat remediation activities such as groundwater from 12 the 200-UP-1 Operable Unit. 13 * Purgewater from groundwater monitoring activities. 14 * Water from deactivation activities, such as water from the spent fuel storage basins at deactivated 15 reactors (e.g., N Reactor). 16 * Laboratory aqueous waste from unused samples and sample analyses. 17 * Leachate from landfills, such as the Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility. 18 * Any dilute waste, which may be accepted for treatment and within the scope of wastewaters that 19 maybe delisted under terms of the revised delisting (40 CFR 261, Appendix IX, Table 2). 20 Most of these aqueous wastes are accumulated in batches in a LERF basin for interim storage and 21 treatment through pH and flow equalization before final treatment in 200 Area ETF. However, some 22 aqueous wastes, such as 200-UP-I Groundwater, maybe treated on a flow through basis in LERF en route 23 to 200 Area ETF for final treatment. The constituents in these aqueous wastes are common to the 24 Hanford Site and were considered in pilot plant testing or in vendor tests, either as a constituent or as a 25 family of constituents. According to the 200 Area ETF Delisting, Permit Condition 1.a.i, all wastes 26 accepted for treatment at 200 Area ETF must be within a specified treatability envelope that ensures that 27 wastes will be within the treatment capability of 200 Area ETF. 28 B.2 Influent Waste Acceptance Process 29 Throughout the acceptance process, there are specific criteria required for an influent waste (i.e., aqueous 30 waste) to be accepted at the LERF and/or 200 Area ETF. These criteria are identified in the following 31 sections and summarized in Table B.2. The process of accepting a waste into the LERF and 200 Area 32 ETF systems involves a series of steps, as follows. 33 * Waste information: The generator of an aqueous waste works with LERF and 200 Area ETF 34 personnel to provide characterization data of the waste stream (Section B.2.1). 35 * Waste management decision process: LERF and 200 Area ETF management decision is based 36 on a case-by-case evaluation of whether an aqueous waste stream is acceptable for treatment or 37 storage at LERF and the 200 Area ETF. The evaluation has two categories: 38 o Regulatory acceptability: a review to determine if there are any, regulatory concerns that 39 would prohibit the storage or treatment of an aqueous waste in the LERF or 200 Area ETF; 40 e.g., treatment would meet permit conditions that would comply with applicable regulations. 41 o Operational acceptability: an evaluation to determine if there are any operational concerns 42 that would prohibit the storage or treatment of an aqueous waste in the LERF or 200 Area 43 ETF and storage of treatment residuals; e.g., determine treatability and compatibility or safety 44 considerations (Section B.2.2.2). Addendum B.9

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 B.2.1 Waste Information 2 When an aqueous waste stream is identified for treatment or storage in the LERF or 200 Area ETF, the 3 generator is required to characterize the waste stream according to the requirements in Section B.2. 1.1 4 and document the results of characterization on an aqueous waste profile sheet. This requirement is the 5 first waste acceptance criterion. 6 The LERF and 200 Area ETF personnel work with the generators to ensure that the necessary information 7 is collected for the characterization of a waste stream (i.e., the appropriate analyses or adequate 8 knowledge), and that the information provided on the waste profile sheet is complete. The completed 9 waste profile sheet is maintained in the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF and 200 Area ETF File 10 according to Permit Condition II.I.1.j. 11 B.2.1.1 Waste Characterization 12 Because the constituents in the individual aqueous waste streams vary, each waste stream is characterized 13 and evaluated for acceptability on a case-by-case basis. The generator is required to designate an aqueous 14 waste, which generally will be based on analytical data. However, a generator may use knowledge to 15 substantiate the waste designation, or for general characterization information. Examples of acceptable 16 knowledge include the following: 17 * Documented data or information on processes similar to that which generated the aqueous waste 18 stream 19 * Information/documentation that the waste stream is from specific, well documented processes, 20 e.g., F-listed wastes 21 * Information/documentation that sampling/analyzing a waste stream would pose health and safety 22 risks to personnel 23 * Information/documentation that the waste stream does not lend itself to collecting a laboratory 24 sample for example, wastewater collected (e.g., sump, tank) where the source water 25 characterization is documented. Typically, these circumstances occur at decommissioned 26 buildings or locations, not at operating units. 27 When a generator performs characterization of a dangerous and/or mixed waste stream based on 28 knowledge, LERF and 200 Area ETF personnel review the knowledge as part of the waste acceptance 29 process to ensure the knowledge satisfies the definition of knowledge in WAC 173-303-040. Specifically, 30 LERF and 200 Area ETF personnel review the generator's processes to verify the integrity of the 31 knowledge, and determine whether the knowledge is current and consistent with requirements of this is 32 WAP. LERF and 200 Area ETF management or their designee determines the final decision on the 33 adequacy of the knowledge. The persons reviewing generator process knowledge and those making 34 decisions on the adequacy of knowledge are trained according to the requirements of Addendum G, 35 Personnel Training. 36 Addendum B.10

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 The generator is also responsible for identifying Land Disposal Restrictions (LDRs) treatment standards 2 applicable to the influent aqueous waste as part of the characterization, as required under 40 CFR 268.40 3 incorporated by reference by WAC 173-303-140. Because the 200 Area ETF main treatment train is a 4 Clean Water Act, equivalent treatment unit [40 CFR 268.37(a)] incorporated by reference by 5 WAC 173-303-140, generators are not required to identify underlying hazardous constituents for 6 characteristic wastes pursuant to 40 CFR 268.9, incorporated by reference by WAC 173-303-140, for 7 wastewaters (i.e., <1 percent total suspended solids and <1 percent total organic carbon). The 200 Area 8 ETF secondary waste (e.g., powder) reflects a change in LDR treatability group (i.e., wastewater to non- 9 wastewater) so there is a new LDR point of generation, at which point any characteristic and associated 10 underlying hazardous constituents must be identified. Therefore, generators of a non-wastewater may be 11 required to identify underlying hazardous constituents for characteristic wastes pursuant to 40 CFR 268.9, 12 incorporated by reference by WAC 173-303-140. 13 When analyzing an aqueous waste stream for LERF and 200 Area ETF waste acceptance characterization, 14 a generator is required to use the target list of parameters identified in Table B.3, of this WAP. This 15 requirement is in addition to any analysis required for purposes of designation under WAC 173-303-070. 16 These data are used by LERF and 200 Area ETF to verify the treatability of an aqueous waste stream, and 17 to develop a treatment plan for the waste after acceptance. Refer to Table B.6, for the corresponding 18 analytical methods. The generator may use knowledge in lieu of some analyses, as determined by LERF 19 and 200 Area ETF management or their designee, if the knowledge satisfies the definition of knowledge 20 in WAC 173-303-040. For example if a generator provides information that the process generating an 21 aqueous waste does not include or involve organic chemicals, analyses for organic compounds likely 22 would not be required. Additional analyses could be required if historical information and/or knowledge 23 indicate that an aqueous waste contains constituents not included in the target list of parameters. 24 The characterization and historical information are documented in the waste profile sheet, which is 25 discussed in the following section and is part of the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF and 26 200 Area ETF File according to Permit Condition 11.1. 27 B.2.1.2 Aqueous Waste Profile Sheet 28 The waste profile sheet documents the characterization of each new aqueous waste stream. The profile 29 includes a detailed description of the source, volume, waste designation and applicable LDR treatment 30 standards, and physical nature (wastewater or non-wastewater) of the aqueous waste. For an aqueous 31 waste to be accepted for treatment or storage in the LERF or 200 Area ETF, each new waste stream 32 generator is required to complete and provide this form to LERF and 200 Area ETF management. Each 33 generator also is required to provide the analytical data and/or knowledge used to designate the aqueous 34 waste stream according to WAC 173-303-070 and to determine the chemical and physical nature of the 35 waste. 36 The LERF and ETF management determine whether the information on the waste profile sheet is 37 sufficient according to the criteria above. The LERF and 200 Area ETF management use this information 38 to evaluate the acceptability of the aqueous waste stream for storage and treatment in the LERF and 39 200 Area ETF, and to determine if the secondary waste generated from treatment is acceptable for storage 40 at the 200 Area ETF and has a defined path forward to final disposal. 41 B.2.2 Waste Management Decision Process 42 All aqueous waste under consideration for acceptance must be characterized using analytical data and/or 43 knowledge. This information is used to determine the acceptability of an aqueous waste stream. The 44 LERF and 200 Area ETF Facility Manager or their designee is responsible for making the decision to 45 accept or reject an aqueous waste stream. The management decision to accept any aqueous waste stream 46 is based on an evaluation of regulatory acceptability and operational acceptability. Each evaluation uses 47 acceptance criteria, which were developed to ensure that an aqueous waste is managed in a safe, 48 environmentally sound, and in compliance with this Permit. The following sections provide detail on the 49 acceptance evaluation and the acceptance criteria. Addendum B.12

--- Page 826 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 An aqueous waste stream could be rejected for one of the following reasons: 2 * The paperwork and/or laboratory analyses from the generator are insufficient 3 * Discrepancies with the regulatory and operational acceptance criteria cannot be reconciled, 4 including: 5 o An aqueous waste is not allowed under the current Washington State Waste Discharge Permit 6 (No. ST 4500) or 200 Area ETF Delisting, and LERF and 200 Area ETF management elect 7 not to pursue an amendment, or the Permit and Delisting cannot be amended 8 (Section B.2.2.1) 9 o An aqueous waste is incompatible with LERF liner materials or with other aqueous waste in 10 LERF and no other management method is available (Section B.2.2.2.2). 11 * Adequate storage or treatment capacity is not available. 12 B.2.2.1 Regulatory Acceptability 13 Each aqueous waste stream is evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if there are any regulatory 14 concerns that would preclude the storage or treatment of a waste in the LERF or 200 Area ETF based on 15 the criteria in Sections B2.2.1.1 and B.2.2.1.2. Before an aqueous waste can be stored or treated in either 16 the LERF or 200 Area ETF, the waste designation must be determined. Information on the waste 17 designation of an aqueous waste is documented in the waste profile sheet. This information is used to 18 confirm that treating or storing the aqueous waste in the LERF or 200 Area ETF is allowed under and in 19 compliance with WAC 173-303, Permit (WA7890008967), 200 Area ETF Delisting in 40 CFR 261, 20 Appendix IX, Table 2, the corresponding State-Issued Delisting, and the Washington State Waste 21 Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500) for 200 Area ETF. 22 B.2.2.1.1 Dangerous Waste Regulations, State and Federal Delisting Actions, and 23 Permits 24 Before an aqueous waste stream is sent to the LERF or 200 Area ETF, the generator will characterize and 25 designate the stream with the appropriate dangerous/hazardous waste numbers according to 26 WAC 173-303-070. Addendum A, the 200 Area ETF Delisting and the corresponding State-Issued 27 Delisting identify the specific waste numbers for dangerous/mixed waste that can be managed in the 28 LERF and 200 Area ETF. Dangerous waste designated with waste numbers not specified in these 29 documents cannot be treated or stored in the LERF or 200 Area ETF, unless the documents are 30 appropriately modified. 31 Additionally, aqueous wastes designated with listed waste numbers identified in the 200 Area ETF 32 Delisting and the corresponding State-Issued Delisting will be managed in accordance with the conditions 33 of the delisting, or an amended delisting. 34 B.2.2.1.2 State Waste Permit Regulations/Permit 35 Compliance with the Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500), constitutes another waste 36 acceptance criterion. In accordance with the permit conditions of the Washington State Waste Discharge 37 Permit (No. ST 4500), the constituents of concern in each new aqueous waste stream must be identified. 38 The waste designation and characterization data provided by the generator are used to identify these 39 constituents. The Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500), defines a constituent of 40 concern in an aqueous waste stream, under the conditions of the Discharge Permit, as any contaminant 41 with a maximum concentration greater than one of the following: 42 * Any limit in the Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500) 43 * Groundwater Quality Criteria (WAC 173-200) 44 * Final Delisting level (40 CFR 261, Appendix IX, Table 2) 45 * The corresponding State-Issued Delisting Addendum B.13

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF * Background groundwater concentration as measured at the SALDS disposal site. The practical 2 quantification limit (PQL) is used for the groundwater background concentration for constituents 3 not analyzed or not detected in the SALDs background data. 4 The Permit conditions of the Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500), also require a 5 demonstration that 200 Area ETF can treat the constituents of concern to below discharge limits. 6 B.2.2.2 Operational Acceptability 7 Because the operating configuration or operating parameters at the LERF and 200 Area ETF can be 8 adjusted or modified, most aqueous waste streams generated on the Hanford Site can be effectively 9 treated to below Delisting and Discharge Permit limits. Because of this flexibility, it would be 10 impractical to define numerical acceptance or decision limits. Such limits would constrain the acceptance 11 of appropriate aqueous waste streams for treatment at the LERF and 200 Area ETF. The versatility of the 12 LERF and 200 Area ETF is better explained in the following examples: 13 * The typical operating configuration of 200 Area ETF is to process an aqueous waste through the 14 UV/OX unit first, followed by the RO unit. However, high concentrations of nitrates may 15 interfere with the performance of the UV/OX. In this case, 200 Area ETF could be configured to 16 process the waste in the RO unit prior to the JV/OX unit. 17 * For a small volume aqueous waste with high concentrations of some anions and metals, the 18 approach may be to first process the waste stream in the secondary treatment train. This approach 19 would prevent premature fouling or scaling of the RO unit. The liquid portion (i.e., untreated 20 overheads from 200 Area ETF evaporator and thin film dryer) would be sent to the primary 21 treatment train. 22 * An aqueous waste with high concentrations of chlorides and fluorides may cause corrosion 23 problems when concentrated in the secondary treatment train. One approach is to adjust the 24 corrosion control measures in the secondary treatment train. An alternative may be to blend this 25 aqueous waste in a LERF basin with another aqueous waste, which has sufficient dissolved 26 solids, such that the concentration of the chlorides in the secondary treatment train would not 27 pose a corrosion concern. 28 * Some metal salts (e.g., barium sulfate) tend to scale the RO membranes. In this situation, 29 descalants used in the treatment process may be increased. 30 * Any effluent that does not meet these limits in one pass through 200 Area ETF treatment process 31 is recycled to 200 Area ETF for re-processing. 32 There are some aqueous wastes, whose chemical and physical properties preclude that waste from being 33 treated or stored at the LERF or 200 Area ETF. Accordingly, an aqueous waste is evaluated to determine 34 if it is treatable, if it would impair the efficiency or integrity of the LERF or 200 Area ETF, and if it is 35 compatible with materials in these units. This evaluation also determines if the aqueous waste is 36 compatible with other aqueous wastes managed in the LERF. 37 The waste acceptance criteria in this category focus on determining treatability of an aqueous waste 38 stream, and on determining any operational concerns that would prohibit the storage or treatment of an 39 aqueous waste stream in the LERF or 200 Area ETF. The chemical and physical properties of an aqueous 40 waste stream are determined as part of the waste characterization, and are documented on the waste 41 profile sheet and compared to the design of the units to determine whether an aqueous waste stream is 42 appropriate for storage and treatment in the LERF and 200 Area ETF. All decisions and supporting 43 rationale and data will be documented in the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF and 200 Area 44 ETF File according to Permit Condition 11.1. 45 B.2.2.3 Special Requirements Pertaining to Land Disposal Restrictions 46 Containers of 200 Area ETF secondary waste are transferred to a storage or final disposal unit, as 47 appropriate (e.g., the Central Waste Complex or to the Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility). Addendum B.14

--- Page 828 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 200 Area ETF personnel provide the analytical characterization data and necessary process knowledge for 2 the waste to be managed by the receiving staff, and the appropriate LDR documentation. 3 The following information on the secondary waste is included on the LDR documentation provided to the 4 receiving unit: 5 * Dangerous waste numbers (as applicable) 6 * Determination on whether the waste is restricted from land disposal according to the requirements 7 of 40 CFR 268 incorporated by reference by WAC 173-303-140 (i.e., the LDR status of the 8 waste) 9 The waste tracking information associated with the transfer of waste 10 * Waste analysis results. 11 Generally, the operating parameters or operating configuration at the LERF or 200 Area ETF can be 12 adjusted or modified to accommodate these properties. However, in those cases where a treatment 13 process or operating configuration cannot be modified, the aqueous waste stream will be excluded from 14 treatment or storage at the LERF or 200 Area ETF. Additionally, an aqueous waste stream is evaluated 15 for the potential to deposit solids in a LERF basin (i.e., whether an aqueous waste contains sludge or 16 could precipitate solids). This evaluation will also consider whether the blending or mixing of two or 17 more aqueous waste streams will result in the formation of a precipitate. However, because the waste 18 streams managed in the LERF and 200 Area ETF are generally dilute, the potential for mixing waste 19 streams and forming a precipitate is low; no specific compatibility tests are performed. Filtration at the 20 waste source could be required before acceptance into LERF. Waste streams with the potential to form 21 precipitates in LERF or that cannot be blended with other waste streams to avoid precipitate formation are 22 not accepted for treatment at LERF and 200 Area ETF. The Load-in Facility has the ability to perform 23 filtration on incoming waste streams going to both the LERF and 200 Area ETF Load in. See additional 24 discussions of precipitate formation and compliance with LDR requirements in Section B.3. Similar 25 filtration requirements could apply to aqueous waste fed directly to 200 Area ETF without interim 26 treatment in LERF. 27 To determine if an aqueous waste meets the criterion of treatability, specific information is required. 28 Treatability of a waste stream is evaluated from characterization data provided by the generator as 29 verified through the waste acceptance process, the 200 Area waste acceptance criteria, and the treatability 30 envelope for the 200 Area ETF as documented in Tables C.1 and C.2 of the November 29, 2001 delisting 31 petition. Generators will also provide characterization data to identify those physical and chemical 32 properties that would interfere with, or foul 200 Area ETF treatment process in consultation with LERF 33 and 200 Area ETF representatives. In some instances, knowledge that meets the definition of knowledge 34 in WAC 173-303-040 is used for purposes of identifying a chemical or physical property that would be of 35 concern. For example, the generator could provide knowledge that the stream has two phases (an oily 36 phase and an aqueous phase). In this case, if the generator could not physically separate the two phases, 37 the aqueous waste stream would be rejected because the oily phase could compromise some of the 38 treatment equipment. Typically, analyses for the following parameters are required to evaluate 39 treatability and operational concerns: * total dissolved solids * barium * nitrite * total organic carbon * calcium * phosphate * total suspended solids * chloride * potassium * specific conductivity * fluoride * silicon * pH * iron * sodium * alkalinity * magnesium * sulfate * ammonia * nitrate Addendum B.15

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I These constituents are identified in Table B.2, which is the list of target analytes used for waste 2 characterization and waste acceptance evaluation. 3 B.2.2.3.1 Compatibility 4 Corrosion Control. Because of the materials of construction used in 200 Area ETF, corrosion is 5 generally not a concern with new aqueous waste streams. Additionally, these waste streams are managed 6 in a manner that minimizes corrosion. To ensure that a waste will not compromise the integrity of 7 200 Area ETF tanks and process equipment, each waste stream is assessed for its corrosion potential as 8 part of the compatibility evaluation. This assessment usually focuses on chloride and fluoride 9 concentrations; however, the chemistry of each new waste also is evaluated for other parameters that 10 could cause corrosion. 11 Compatibility with Liquid Effluent Retention Facility Liner and Piping. As part of the acceptance 12 process, the criteria of compatibility with the LERF liner materials are evaluated for each aqueous waste 13 stream. This evaluation is performed using knowledge (as defined by WAC 173-303-040) of constituent 14 concentrations in the aqueous waste stream or using constituent concentrations obtained by analyzing the 15 waste stream for the constituents identified in Table B.1 using the analytical methods for these 16 constituents in Section B.9. Then, the constituent concentrations in the waste stream are compared to the 17 decision criteria in Table B. 1. If all constituent concentrations are below the decision criteria, then the 18 waste stream is considered compatible with the LERF liner and may be accepted for treatment. 19 Otherwise, the waste stream is considered incompatible with the LERF liner, and it cannot be accepted for 20 treatment in the LERF basins. However, a waste stream may still be acceptable for treatment in ETF if it 21 is fed directly to ETF, bypassing the LERF Basins. Results of this evaluation are documented in the 22 Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF and 200 Area ETF File according to Permit Condition 11.1. 23 The rational for establishing the liner compatibility constituents and decision criteria in Table B. I is as 24 follows: The high-density polyethylene liners in the LERF basins potentially are vulnerable to the 25 presence of certain constituents that might be present in some aqueous waste. Using EPA SW-846, 26 Method 9090, the liner materials were tested to evaluate compatibility between aqueous waste stored in 27 the LERF and synthetic liner components. Based on the data from the compatibility test and vendor data 28 on the liner materials, several constituents and parameters were identified as potentially harmful (at high 29 concentrations) to the integrity of the liners. From these data and the application of safety factors, 30 concentration limits in Table B. 1 were established. 31 The strategy for protecting the integrity of a LERF liner is to establish upfront that an aqueous waste is 32 compatible before the waste is accepted into LERF. Characterization data on each new aqueous waste 33 stream are compared to the limits outlined in Table B. I to ensure compatibility with the LERF liner 34 material before acceptance into the LERF. 35 Before a waste stream is processed at the 242-A Evaporator, the generator reviews DST analytical data 36 and a process condensate profile is developed to ensure the process condensate is compatible with the 37 LERF liner. For flow through aqueous wastes like the 200-UP-1 Groundwater, characterization data will 38 be obtained and reviewed every two years to ensure that liner compatibility is maintained. 39 In some instances, knowledge may be adequate to determine that an aqueous waste is compatible with the 40 LERF liner. When knowledge is used, it must satisfy the definition of knowledge in WAC 173-303-040. 41 In those instances where knowledge is adequate, the waste characterization would likely not require 42 analysis for these parameters and constituents. Storm water is an example where knowledge is adequate 43 to determine that this aqueous waste is compatible with the LERF liner. 44 Compatibility with Other Waste. Some aqueous wastes, especially small volume streams, are 45 accumulated in the LERF with other aqueous waste. Before acceptance into the LERF, the aqueous waste 46 stream is evaluated for its compatibility with the resident aqueous waste(s). The evaluation focuses on 47 the potential for an aqueous waste to react with another waste (40 CFR 264, Appendix V, Examples of 48 Potentially Incompatible Wastes) including formation of any precipitate in the LERF basins. Addendum B.16

--- Page 830 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 However, the potential for problems associated with commingling aqueous wastes is very low due to the 2 dilute nature of the wastes; this evaluation confirms the compatibility of two or more aqueous wastes 3 from different sources. Compatibility is determined by evaluating parameters such as pH, ammonia, and 4 chloride. No specific analytical test for compatibility is performed. 5 If it is determined that an aqueous waste stream is incompatible with other aqueous waste streams, 6 alternate management scenarios are available. For example, another LERF basin that contains a 7 compatible aqueous waste(s) might be used, or the aqueous waste stream might be fed directly into 8 200 Area ETF for treatment. In any case, potentially incompatible waste streams are not mixed, and all 9 aqueous waste is managed in a way that precludes a reaction, degradation of the liner, or interference with 10 200 Area ETF treatment process. 11 B.2.3 Periodic Review Process 12 In accordance with WAC 173-303-300(4)(a), an influent aqueous waste will be periodically reviewed as 13 necessary to ensure that the characterization is accurate and current. At a minimum, an aqueous waste 14 stream will be reviewed in the following situations. 15 * The LERF and 200 Area ETF management have been notified, or have reason to believe that the 16 process generating the waste has changed. 17 * The LERF and 200 Area ETF management note an increase or decrease in the concentration of a 18 constituent in an aqueous waste stream, beyond the range of concentrations that was described or 19 predicted in the waste characterization. 20 * Waste streams will be reviewed every two years. 21 In these situations, LERF and 200 Area ETF management will review the available information. If 22 existing analytical information is not sufficient, the generator may be asked to review and update the 23 current waste characterization, to supply a new WPS, or re-sample and re-analyze the aqueous waste, as 24 necessary. Other situations that might require a re-evaluation of a waste stream are discussed in the 25 following sections. 26 B.2.4 Record/information and Decision 27 The information and data collected throughout the acceptance process, and the evaluation and decision on 28 whether to accept an influent aqueous waste stream for treatment or storage in the LERF or 200 Area ETF 29 are documented as part of Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF and 200 Area ETF File pursuant to 30 Permit Condition 11.1. Specifically, the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF and 200 Area ETF File 31 contains the following components on a new influent aqueous waste stream: 32 * The signed WPS for each aqueous waste stream and analytical data. 33 * Knowledge used to characterize a dangerous/mixed waste (under WAC 173-303), and 34 information supporting the adequacy of the knowledge. 35 * The evaluation on whether an aqueous waste stream meets the waste acceptance criteria, 36 including: 37 o The evaluation for regulatory acceptability including appropriate regulatory approvals. 38 o The evaluation for LERF liner compatibility and for compatibility with other aqueous waste. 39 Addendum B.17

The LERF and 200 Area ETF can store and treat influent aqueous wastes with waste numbers identified in Addendum A for the LERF and 200 Area ETF, and the 200 Area ETF Delisting, 40 CFR 261, Appendix IX, Table 2. B. The aqueous waste must comply with conditions of the Discharge Permit. Operational acceptability A. Determine whether an aqueous waste stream is treatable, considering: Whether the removal and destruction efficiencies on the constituents of concern will be adequate to meet the Discharge Permit and Delisting levels Other treatability concerns; analyses for this evaluation may include: total dissolved solids iron total organic carbon magnesium total suspended solids nitrate specific conductivity nitrite alkalinity phosphate ammonia potassium barium silicon calcium sodium chloride sulfate fluoride pH B.

Whether an aqueous waste stream is compatible with other aqueous waste(s), 40 CFR 264, Appendix V, comparison will be used. 1 B.3 Special Management Requirements 2 Special management requirements for aqueous wastes that are managed in the LERF or 200 Area ETF are 3 discussed in the following section. 4 B.3.1 Land Disposal Restriction Compliance at Liquid Effluent Retention Facility 5 Because LERF provides treatment through flow and pH equalization, a surface impoundment treatment 6 exemption from the land disposal restrictions was granted in accordance with 40 CFR 268.4, and 7 WAC 173-303-040. This treatment exemption is subject to several conditions, including a requirement 8 that the WAP address the sampling and analysis of the treatment 'residue' [40 CFR 268.4(a)(2)(i) and 9 WAC 173-303-300(5)(h)(i) and (ii)] to ensure the 'residue' meets applicable treatment standards. Though 10 the term 'residue' is not specifically defined, this condition further requires that sampling must be 11 designed to represent the "sludge and the supernatant" indicating that a residue may have a sludge (solid) 12 and supernatant (liquid) component. Addendum B.19

--- Page 833 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 Solid residue is not anticipated to accumulate in a LERF basin for the following reasons: 2 * Aqueous waste streams containing sludge would not be accepted into LERF under the acceptance 3 criteria of treatability (Section B.2.2.2. 1). 4 * No solid residue was reported from process condensate discharged to LERF in 1995. 5 * The LERF basins are covered and all incoming air first passes through a breather filter. 6 * No precipitating or flocculating chemicals are used in flow and pH equalization. 7 * Multiple waste streams managed in a single LERF basin are evaluated for the formation of 8 precipitates. Wastes that would form precipitates are not accepted for treatment at LERF. 9 Therefore, the residue component subject to this condition is the supernatant (liquid component). 10 Additionally, an aqueous waste stream is evaluated for the potential to deposit solids in a LERF basin 11 (i.e., an aqueous waste that contains suspended solids). If necessary, filtration at the waste source could 12 be required before acceptance into LERF. Therefore, the residue component in LERF subject to this 13 condition is the supernatant (liquid component). The contingency for removal of solids will be addressed 14 during closure in Addendum H, Closure Plan. 15 The conditions of the treatment exemption also require that treatment residues (i.e., aqueous wastes), 16 which do not meet the LDR treatment standards "must be removed at least annually" 17 [40 CFR 268.4(a)(2)(ii) incorporated by reference by WAC 173-303-140]. To address the conditions of 18 this exemption, an influent aqueous waste is sampled and analyzed and the LDR status of the aqueous 19 waste is established as part of the acceptance process. The LERF basins are then managed such that any 20 aqueous waste(s), which exceeds an LDR standard is removed annually from a LERF basin, except for a 21 heel of approximately 1 meter. A heel is required to stabilize the LERF liner. The volume of the heel is 22 approximately 1.9 million liters. 23 B.4 Influent Aqueous Waste Sampling and Analysis 24 The following sections provide a summary of the sampling procedures, frequencies, and analytical 25 parameters for characterization of influent aqueous waste (Section B.2) and in support of the special 26 management requirements for aqueous waste in the LERF (Section B.3). 27 B.4.1 Sampling Procedures 28 With a few exceptions, generators are responsible for the characterization, including sampling and 29 analysis, of an influent aqueous waste. Process condensate is either sampled at the 242-A Evaporator or 30 accumulated in a LERF basin following a 242-A Evaporator campaign and sampled. Other exceptions 31 will be handled on a case-by-case basis and the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF and 200 Area 32 ETF File will be maintained at the unit for inspection by Ecology. The following section discusses the 33 sampling locations, methodologies, and frequencies for these aqueous wastes. For samples collected at 34 the LERF and 200 Area ETF, unit-specific sampling protocol is followed. The sample containers, 35 preservation materials, and holding times for each analysis are listed in Section B.9. 36 B.4.1.1 Batch Samples 37 In those cases where an aqueous waste is sampled in a LERF basin, samples are collected from four of the 38 six available sample risers located in each basin, i.e., four separate samples. When LERF levels are low, 39 fewer than four samples can be taken if the sampling approach is still representative. Though there are 40 eight sample risers at each basin, one is dedicated to liquid level instrumentation and another is dedicated 41 as an influent port. Operating experience indicates that four samples adequately capture the spatial 42 variability of an aqueous waste stream in the LERF basin. Specifically, sections of stainless steel 43 (or other compatible material) tubing are inserted into the sample riser to an appropriate depth. Using a 44 portable pump, the sample line is flushed with the aqueous waste and the sample collected. The grab 45 sample containers typically are filled for volatile organic compounds (VOC) analysis first, followed by 46 the remainder of the containers for the other parameters. Addendum B.20

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I Several sample ports are also located at 200 Area ETF, including a valve on the recirculation line at 2 200 Area ETF surge tank, and a sample valve on a tank discharge pump line at 200 Area ETF Load-in 3 Station. All samples are obtained at the LERF or 200 Area ETF are collected in a manner consistent with 4 SW-846 procedures (EPA as amended). 5 B.4.2 Analytical Rationale 6 As stated previously, each generator is responsible for designating and characterizing an aqueous waste 7 stream. Accordingly, each generator samples and analyzes an influent waste stream using the target list 8 of parameters (Table B.3) for the waste acceptance process. At the discretion of the LERF and ETF 9 management, a generator may provide knowledge in lieu of some analyses as discussed in 10 Section B.2.1.1. The LERF and ETF personnel will work with the generator to determine which 11 parameters are appropriate for the characterization. 12 The analytical methods for these parameters are provided in Section B.9. All methods are EPA methods 13 satisfying the requirements of WAC 173-303-110(3). Additional analyses may be required if historical 14 information and knowledge indicate that an influent aqueous waste contains constituents not included in 15 the target list of parameters. For example, if knowledge indicates that an aqueous waste contains a 16 parameter that is regulated by the Groundwater Quality Criteria (WAC 173-200), that parameter(s) would 17 be added to the suite of analyses required for that aqueous waste stream. 18 The analytical data for the parameters presented in Table B.3, including VOC, Semi-volatile Organic 19 Compound (SVOC), metals, anions, and general chemistry parameters are used to define the physical and 20 chemical properties of the aqueous waste for the following: 21 * Set operating conditions in the LERF and ETF (e.g., to determine operating configuration, refer 22 to Section B.2.2.2) 23 * Identify concentrations of some constituents which may also interfere with, or foul ETF treatment 24 process (e.g., fouling of the RO membranes, refer to Section B.2.2.2) 25 * Evaluate LERF liner and piping material compatibility 26 * Determine treatability to evaluate if applicable constituents in the treated effluent will meet 27 Discharge Permit and Delisting limits 28 * Estimate concentrations of some constituents in the waste generated in the secondary treatment 29 train (i.e., dry powder waste). 30 Addendum B.21

To determine whether the Discharge Permit early 4 warning values, enforcement limits, and the Delisting criteria are met, the effluent routinely is sampled at 5 the verification tanks. The sampling and analyses performed are described in the following sections. 6 B.5.1 Rationale for Effluent Analysis Parameter Selection 7 The parameters measured in the treated effluent are required by the following regulatory documents: 8 * Delisting criteria from the 200 Area ETF Delisting (40 CFR 261, Appendix IX, Table 2) 9 * Corresponding State Final Delisting issued pursuant to WAC 173-303-910(3) 10 * Effluent limits from the Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500) 11 * Early warning values from the Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500) 12 The 200 Area ETF Delisting provides two testing regimes for the treated effluent. Initial verification 13 testing is performed when a new influent waste stream is processed through the 200 Area ETF. Addendum B.22

--- Page 836 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 For each 200 Area ETF influent waste stream, the first generated verification tank must be sampled and 2 analyzed for all delisting constituents and conductivity. Subsequent verification sampling and analysis of 3 all delisting parameters is performed on every 151 tank of that 200 Area ETF influent waste stream. If 4 the concentration of any analyte is found to exceed a Washington State Waste Discharge Permit 5 (No. ST 4500), enforcement limit or a Delisting criterion, the contents of the verification tank are 6 reprocessed and/or re-analyzed. The next verification tank generated is also sampled for all delisting 7 constituents. If the concentration of any analyte exceeds an early warning value, an early warning value 8 report is prepared and submitted to Ecology. 9 B.5.2 Effluent Sampling Strategy: Methods, Location, Analyses, and Frequency 10 Effluent sampling methods and locations, the analyses performed, and frequency of sampling are 11 discussed in the following sections. 12 B.5.2.1 Effluent Sampling Method and Location 13 Samples of treated effluent are collected and analyzed to verify the treatment process using 200 Area ETF 14 specific sampling protocol. These verification samples are collected at a sampling port on the verification 15 tank recirculation line. Section B.9 presents the sample containers, preservatives, and holding times for 16 each parameter monitored in the effluent. 17 B.5.2.2 Analyses of Effluent 18 The parameters required by the current Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500), and 19 Final Delisting 200 Area ETF, conditions are presented in Table B.4. The analytical methods and PQLs 20 associated with each parameter are provided in Section B.9. The methods and PQLs are equivalent to 21 those used in the analysis of influent aqueous waste. 22 B.5.2.3 Frequency of Sampling 23 Treated effluent is tested for all parameters listed in Table B.4 on a frequency satisfying the permit 24 conditions of the Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500), and the 200 Area ETF 25 Delisting. This effluent must meet the Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500), and 26 200 Area ETF Delisting limits associated with these parameters. Grab samples are collected from each 27 verification tank. 28 During operation of 200 Area ETF, if one or more of the constituents exceeds a Delisting criterion, the 29 Delisting conditions require: 30 * The characterization data and processing strategy of the influent waste stream be reviewed and 31 changed accordingly to ensure the contents of subsequent tanks do not exceed the Delisting 32 criteria 33 * The contents of the verification tank are recycled for additional treatment. The contents that are 34 recycled are resampled after treatment to ensure no constituents exceed a Delisting criteria 35 * The contents of the following verification tank are sampled for compliance with the Delisting 36 criteria. 37 * Treated effluent that does not meet Washington State Waste Discharge Permit (No. ST 4500) is 38 not discharged to the SALDS until the tank has been retreated and/or reanalyzed. 39 B.6 Effluent Treatment Facility Generated Waste Sampling and Analysis 40 The wastes discussed in this section include the wastes generated at 200 Area ETF and are managed in the 41 container storage areas of 200 Area ETF. This section describes the characterization of the following 42 secondary waste streams generated within 200 Area ETF: 43 * Secondary waste generated from the treatment process, including the following waste forms: 44 o dry powder waste Addendum B.23

--- Page 837 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 o concentrate tanks slurry 2 o sludge removed from process tanks 3 * Waste generated by operations and maintenance activities 4 * Miscellaneous waste generated within 200 Area ETF. 5 For each waste stream described, a characterization methodology and rationale are provided, and 6 sampling requirements are addressed. 7 B.6.1 Secondary Waste Generated from Treatment Processes 8 The following terms used in this Section, including powder, dry powder, waste powder, and dry waste 9 powder, are equivalent to the term 'dry powder waste'. 10 A dry powder waste is generated from the secondary treatment train, from the treatment of an aqueous 11 waste. Waste is received in the secondary treatment train in waste receiving tanks where it is fed into an 12 evaporator. Concentrate waste from the evaporator is then fed to a concentrate tank. From these tanks, 13 the waste is fed to a thin film dryer and dried into a powder, and collected into containers. The containers 14 are filled via a remotely controlled system. The condensed overheads from the evaporator and thin film 15 dryer are returned to the surge tank to be fed to the primary treatment train. 16 Occasionally, salts from the treatment process (e.g., calcium sulfate and magnesium hydroxide) 17 accumulate in process tanks as sludge. Because processing these salts could cause fouling in the thin film 18 dryer, and to allow uninterrupted operation of the treatment process, the sludge is removed and placed in 19 containers. The sludge is dewatered and the supernate is pumped back to 200 Area ETF for treatment. 20 The secondary treatment system typically receives and processes the following by-products generated 21 from the primary treatment train: 22 * Concentrate from the first RO stage 23 * Backwash from the rough and fine filters 24 * Regeneration waste from the ion exchange system 25 * Spillage or overflow collected in the process sumps. 26 In an alternate operating scenario, some aqueous wastes may be fed to the secondary treatment train 27 before the primary treatment train. 28 B.6.1.1 Special Requirements Pertaining to Land Disposal Restrictions 29 Containers of 200 Area ETF secondary waste are transferred to a storage or final disposal unit, as 30 appropriate (e.g., the Central Waste Complex or to the Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility). 31 200 Area ETF personnel provide the analytical characterization data and necessary knowledge for the 32 waste to be managed by the receiving staff, and for the appropriate LDR documentation. 33 The following information on the secondary waste is included on the LDR documentation provided to the 34 receiving unit: 35 * Dangerous waste numbers (as applicable) 36 * Determination on whether the waste is restricted from land disposal according to the requirements 37 of 40 CFR 268 incorporated by reference by WAC 173-303-140 (i.e., the LDR status of the 38 waste) 39 The waste tracking information associated with the transfer of waste 40 * Waste analysis results. Addendum B.24

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 B.6.1.2 Sampling Methods 2 The dry powder waste and containerized sludge are sampled from containers using the principles 3 presented in SW-846 (EPA as amended) and ASTM Methods (American Society for Testing Materials), 4 as referenced in WAC 173-303-110(2). The sample container requirements, sample preservation 5 requirements, and maximum holding times for each of the parameters analyzed in either matrix are 6 presented in Section B.9. 7 Concentrate tank waste samples are collected from recirculation lines, which provide mixing in the tank 8 during pH adjustment and prevent caking. The protocol for concentrate tank sampling prescribes opening 9 a sample port in the recirculation line to collect samples directly into sample containers. The sample port 10 line is flushed before collecting a grab sample. The VOC sampling typically is performed first for grab 11 samples. Each VOC sample container will be filled such that cavitation at the sample valve is minimized 12 and the container has no headspace. The remainder of the containers for the other parameters will be 13 filled next. Table B.4.

A batch is defined as any volume of aqueous 9 waste that is being treated under consistent and constant process conditions. 10 When personnel exposures are of concern, one representative sample will be collected from the 11 concentrate tank, if waste from the concentrate tank. The sample will be analyzed for the appropriate 12 parameters identified in Table B.5 based on the needs identified from evaluating influent waste analysis 13 data. If sampling of the concentrate tank is not technically practicable for purposes of designating the 14 powder, direct sampling of the dry powder will be used to make determinations on the dry powder. The 15 dry powder or concentrate tanks will be resampled in the following situations: 16 * Change in influent characterization. 17 * Change in process chemistry, as indicated by in-line monitoring of conductivity and pH. 18 * The LERF and 200 Area ETF management have been notified, or have reason to believe that the 19 process generating the waste has changed (for example, a source change such as a change in the 20 well-head for groundwater that significantly changes the aqueous waste characterization). 21 * The LERF and 200 Area ETF management note an increase or decrease in the concentration of a 22 constituent in an aqueous waste stream, beyond the range of concentrations that was described or 23 predicted in the waste characterization. 24 B.6.2 Operations and Maintenance Waste Generated at the 200 Area Effluent 25 Treatment Facility 26 Operation and maintenance of process and ancillary equipment generates additional routine waste. These 27 waste materials are segregated to ensure proper handling and disposition, and to minimize the 28 commingling of potentially dangerous waste with nondangerous waste. The following waste streams are 29 anticipated to be generated during routine operation and maintenance of 200 Area ETF. This waste might 30 or might not be dangerous waste, depending on the nature of the material and its exposure to a dangerous 31 waste. 32 * Spent lubricating oils and paint waste from pumps, the dryer rotor, compressors, blowers, and 33 general maintenance activities. 34 * Spent filter media and process filters. 35 * Spent ion exchange resin. 36 * High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters. 37 * UV light tubes. 38 * RO membranes. 39 * Equipment that cannot be returned to service. 40 * Other miscellaneous waste that might contact a dangerous waste (e.g., plastic sheeting, glass, 41 rags, paper, waste solvent, or aerosol cans). 42 These waste streams are stored at 200 Area ETF before being transferred for final treatment, storage, or 43 disposal as appropriate. 44 Addendum B.27

--- Page 841 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 This waste is characterized and designated using knowledge (from previously determined influent 2 aqueous waste composition information); analytical data; and material safety data sheets (MSDS) of the 3 chemical products present in the waste or used (the data sheets are maintained at 200 Area ETF). 4 Sampling of these waste streams is not anticipated; however, if an unidentified or unlabeled waste is 5 discovered, that waste is sampled. This 'unknown' waste is sampled and analyzed for the parameters in 6 Table B.5 as appropriate, and will be designated according to Washington state regulatory requirements. 7 The specific analytical methods for these analyses are provided in Section B.9. 8 B.6.3 Other Waste Generated at the 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility 9 There are two other potential sources of waste at 200 Area ETF: spills and/or overflows, and discarded 10 chemical products. Spills may be subject to the requirements of Permit Condition II.E. Spilled material 11 that potentially might be dangerous waste generally is either containerized or routed to 200 Area ETF 12 sumps where the material is transferred either to the surge tank for treatment or to the secondary treatment 13 train. In most cases, knowledge and the use of MSDSs are sufficient to designate the waste material. If 14 the source of the spilled material is unknown and the material cannot be routed to 200 Area ETF sumps, a 15 sample of the waste is collected and analyzed according to Table B.5, as necessary, for appropriate 16 characterization of the waste. Unknown wastes will be designated according to Washington State 17 regulatory requirements at WAC 173-303-070. The specific analytical methods for these analyses are 18 provided in Section B.9. 19 A discarded chemical product waste stream could be generated if process chemicals, cleaning agents, or 20 maintenance products become contaminated or are otherwise rendered unusable. In all cases, these 21 materials are appropriately containerized and designated. Sampling is performed, as appropriate, for 22 waste designation. 23 Table B.5. 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility Generated Waste -Sampling and 24 Analysis Parameter' Rationale * Total solids or percent water2 * Calculate dry weight concentrations * Volatile organic compounds' * LDR -verify treatment standards * Semivolatile organic compounds' * LDR -verify treatment standards * Metals (arsenic, barium, cadmium, * Waste designation chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, * LDR -verify treatment standards silver) * Cation and anions of concern * Address receiving TSD unit waste acceptance requirements * pH * Waste designation 25 1 For influent and concentrate tank samples, the total sample (solid plus liquid) is analyzed and the analytical result 26 is expressed on a dry weight basis. The result for toxicity characteristic metal and organic is divided by a factor 27 of 20 and compared to the toxicity characteristic (TC) constituent limits [WAC 173-303-090(8)]. If the TC limit 28 is met or exceeded, the waste is designated accordingly. All measured parameters are compared against the 29 corresponding treatment standards. 30 2 Total solids or percent water are not determined for unknown waste and dry powder waste samples and are 31 analyzed in maintenance waste and sludge samples, as appropriate ( i.e., percent water might not be required for 32 such routine maintenance waste as aerosol cans, fluorescent tubes, waste oils, batteries, etc., or sludge that has 33 dried). 34 3 VOC and/or SVOC analysis of secondary waste is required unless influent characterization data and knowledge 35 indicate that the constituent will not be in the final secondary waste at or above the LDR. 36 LDR = land disposal restrictions 37 TSD = treatment, storage, and/or disposal Addendum B.28

The Facility Manager also provides retention of 10 project records in accordance with this plan. Assisting the Facility Manager is an Environmental Field 11 Representative that monitors compliance, reviews new requirements and regulations, and interfaces with 12 EPA and Ecology. Also assisting the Facility Manager is a QA representative who is responsible for 13 implementing the QA program at the facility. 14 Reporting to the Facility Manager are several support groups. The Operations group consists of trained 15 personnel who operate the plant, including operators performing sampling activities such as collection, 16 packaging, and transportation of samples to the laboratory. The Maintenance group is responsible for 17 performing calibrations and preventative maintenance on facility equipment, including pH, conductivity, 18 and flow meters required by environmental permits. The Engineering group monitors the process with 19 online instruments and sampling for process control. The Engineering group also performs waste 20 acceptance, and environmental compliance activities, including scheduling sampling, generating data 21 forms, and reviewing data. 22 B.7.1.2 Special Training 23 Individuals involved in sampling, analysis, and data review will be trained and qualified to implement 24 safely the activities addressed in this WAP and QA/QC plan. Training will conform to the training 25 requirements specified in WAC 173-303-330 and the LERF/200 Area ETF Dangerous Waste Training 26 Plan (Addendum F). Training records will be maintained in accordance with Section B.7.1.3 of this 27 WAP. 28 B.7.1.3 Documentation and Records 29 Sample records are documented as part of the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF and 200 Area 30 ETF File pursuant to Permit Condition 11.1. These documents and records include the following: 31 * Training 32 * Chains of Custody for all regulatory sampling performed by LERF and 200 Area ETF 33 * Data Summary Reports 34 * QA/QC reports 35 * Assessment reports 36 * Instrument inspection, maintenance, and calibration logs 37 B.7.2 Data Quality Parameters and Criteria 38 Data quality parameters are listed by EPA QA/G-5S, Guidance for Choosing a Sampling Design for 39 Environmental Data Collection as: 40 * Purpose of Data Collection (e.g. determining if a parameter exceeds a threshold level). 41 * Spatial and Temporal Boundaries of Study. 42 * Preliminary Estimation of Sample Support (volume that each sample represents). Addendum B.29

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 * Statistical Parameter of Interest (e.g. mean, percentile, percentage). 2 * Limits on Decision Error/Precision (e.g. false acceptance error, false rejection error). 3 The parameters for the first four bullets (limits, sample points, frequency of samples, etc.) are already 4 established in the permits, delisting petition, and this WAP. The focus of this QA/QC plan is on limits on 5 decision error/precision. 6 The data quality parameters were chosen to ensure Limits on Decision Error/Precision are appropriate for 7 purposes of using the data to demonstrate compliance with permits, delisting exclusion limits, and this 8 WAP. The principal quality parameters are precision, accuracy, representativeness, comparability, and 9 completeness. Secondary data parameters of importance include sensitivity and detection levels. The 10 data quality parameters and the data acceptance criteria are discussed below. 11 B.7.2.1 Precision 12 Precision is a measure of agreement among replicate measurements of the same property, under 13 prescribed similar conditions. Precision is expressed in terms of the relative percent difference (RPD) for 14 duplicate measurements. QA/QC sample types that test precision include field and laboratory duplicates 15 and spike duplicates. The RPDs for laboratory duplicates and/or matrix spike duplicates will be routinely 16 calculated. 17 RPD = (100)absolute value of sample result -duplicate sample result average of sample result + duplicate sample result 18 Matrix spike duplicates are replicates of matrix spike samples that are analyzed with every analytical 19 batch that contains an ETF treated effluent sample. The precision of the analytical methods are estimated 20 from the results of the matrix spike (MS) and the matrix spike duplicate (MSD) for selected analytes. 21 Matrix spike analyses cannot be performed for certain analytical methods, including conductivity, pH, 22 and total dissolved solids. Duplicate analyses are used to determine the RPD for these methods. The 23 precision acceptance criteria are specified in Table B.6. 24 B.7.2.2 Accuracy 25 Accuracy assesses the closeness of the measured value to an accepted reference value. Accuracy of 26 analytical results is typically assessed using matrix spikes. A matrix spike is the addition of a known 27 amount of the analyte to the sample matrix being analyzed. Accuracy is expressed as a percent recovery 28 of the spiked samples. 29 Percent Recovery = 100 (matrix spike sample result -sample result spiked amount 30 Matrix spike analyses cannot be performed on certain analytical methods, including conductivity, pH, and 31 total dissolved solids. The percent recovery for the laboratory control standard samples demonstrates that 32 these methods are working properly and gives an estimate of the method's accuracy. The percent 33 recovery will be routinely calculated. 34 Accuracy criteria are established to provide confidence that the result is below the action level. Therefore 35 the closer the result is to the action level the higher the degree of accuracy needed. The upper and lower 36 accuracy acceptance criteria are specified in Table B.6. The criteria are reasonable values based on 37 previous analysis of constituents in the delisting exclusion, or similar constituents. 38 B.7.2.3 Representativeness 39 Representativeness expresses the degree to which data accurately and precisely represent selected 40 characteristics of a parameter at a sampling point or process condition. 41 Addendum B.30

--- Page 844 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I Because of the matrix being analyzed, dilute aqueous solution, it is not expected that representativeness 2 will be of concern, except when there are potential for changes to process conditions such as the facility 3 influent concentrations or waste processing strategy. Sampling due to these changes in process conditions 4 is addressed in Section B.6.1.3 of this WAP. 5 The representativeness of a sample may be compromised by the presence of contaminants introduced in 6 the field or the laboratory. To determine if contamination may be present, a blank sample of reagent 7 water is analyzed. A method blank is performed by the laboratory on every batch of 20 samples being 8 analyzed at the same time. The presence of a constituent in the sample and the blank sample indicates 9 contamination has occurred. 10 B.7.2.4 Completeness 11 Completeness is a measure of the amount of valid data obtained from a measurement system, expressed 12 as a percentage of the number of valid measurements that were planned to be collected. Lack of 13 completeness is sometimes caused by loss of a sample, loss of data, or inability to collect the planned 14 number of samples. Incompleteness also occurs when data are discarded because they are of unknown or 15 unacceptable quality. Since most regulatory sampling events performed by LERF/200 Area ETF involve 16 a single sample, all analysis must be complete and valid. 17 B.7.2.5 Comparability 18 Comparability is the confidence with which one data set can be compared to another. Comparability is 19 achieved by using sampling and analytical techniques, which provide for measurements that are 20 consistent and representative of the media and conditions measured. In laboratory analysis, the term 21 comparability focuses on method type, holding times, stability issues, and aspects of overall analytical 22 quantitation. 23 B.7.2.6 Sensitivity and Detection Levels 24 Sensitivity is the measure of the concentration at which an analytical method can positively identify and 25 report analytical results. Sensitivity represents the maximum value for a detection level that will 26 reasonably assure the results are below the established limits. The analytical method selected by 27 LERF/200 Area ETF should have a detection level for each constituent that is below the sensitivity. The 28 preferred detection level is the practical quantitation limit (PQL), which is lowest concentration that can 29 be reliably measured during routine laboratory conditions. If the method PQL cannot meet the sensitivity 30 for some constituents, the minimum concentration or attribute that can be measured by a method (method 31 detection limit) or by an instrument (instrument detection limit) may be used. The sensitivity levels, 32 specified in Table B.6, are derived from the delisting limits, water discharge limits, and uncertainty 33 values, which are based on the required precision and accuracy for each constituent. 34 B.7.3 Data Generation and Acquisition 35 The following section addresses QA requirements for data generation and acquisition. 36 B.7.3.1 Sampling Method 37 LERF/200 Area ETF samples required by the permits and delisting are collected as grab samples. 38 Sampling for the purpose of waste designation of secondary waste is performed using grab, composite, 39 thief, scoop, or composite liquid waste sampler (COLIWASA). The selection of the sample collection 40 device depends on the type of sample, the sample container, the sampling location, and the nature and 41 distribution of the waste components. In general, the methodologies used for specific materials 42 correspond to those referenced to WAC 173-303-110(2). The selection and use of the sampling device is 43 supervised or performed by a person thoroughly familiar with the sampling requirements. 44 The following protocol applies to all sampling methods: 45 * All containers will be filled within as short a time period as reasonably achievable. Addendum B.31

--- Page 845 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 * Volatile Organic Analysis (VOA) sample containers will be filled first, and prior to any 2 subdividing of a composited sample. 3 * VOA samples consisting of a set of two or more sample containers will be filled sequentially. 4 The sample containers are considered equivalent and given identical sampling times. 5 * All VOA sample containers must have no headspace and be free of trapped air bubbles. 6 * Grab sample protocol includes: 7 o Sample lines should be as short as reasonably achievable and free of traps and pockets in 8 which solids might settle. 9 o The sample line should be flushed before sampling with a minimum volume equivalent to 10 three times the sample line volume. 11 0 Contamination to the sample from contact with the internal and external surfaces of the tap 12 should be minimized. 13 Thief and COLIWASA samplers are used to sample liquid waste containers such as drums. Scoop 14 samplers are used to sample powder waste generated in the thin-film dryer. Sample requirements for 15 these samples include: 16 * Thief or COLIWASA sampler, the sampler should be lowered into the liquid slowly so the level 17 of the liquid inside and outside the sampler tube remain about the same. 18 * When lifting the thief or COLIWASA sampler from the solution, the outside should be wiped 19 down, or the excess water allowed to drip off, before filling the sample container. 20 B.7.3.2 Sample Handling, Custody, and Shipping 21 The proper handling of sample bottles after sampling is important to ensure the samples are free of 22 contamination and to demonstrate the samples have not been tampered with. 23 B.7.3.2.1 Chain-of-Custody 24 Evidence of collection, shipment, receipt at the laboratory, and laboratory custody until disposal will be 25 documented using a chain-of-custody form. The chain-of-custody form will, as a minimum identify 26 sample identification number, sampling date and time, sampling location, sample bottle type and number, 27 analyses to be performed, and preservation method. 28 The operations person who signs as the collector on the chain of custody is the first custodian of the 29 samples. A custodian must maintain continuous custody of sample containers at all times from the time 30 the sample is taken until delivery to the laboratory or until delivery to a common carrier for shipment to 31 an off-site location. Custody is maintained by any of the following: 32 * The custodian has the samples in view, or has placed the samples in locked storage, or keeps the 33 samples within a secured area (e.g., controlled by authorized personnel only), or has applied a 34 tamper-indicating device, such as evidence tape, to the sample containers or shipping containers. 35 * The custodian has taken physical possession of the samples or the shipping containers sealed with 36 an intact tamper-indicating device, such as evidence tape. 37 B.7.3.2.2 Sample Preservation, Containers, and Holding Time 38 Table B.6 lists the sample container, preservation method, and holding time requirements for different 39 types of analyses. These parameters are based on the requirements of 40 CFR 136, Table II. 40 B.7.3.3 Instrument Calibration and Preventive Maintenance 41 LERF/200 Area ETF uses instruments to monitor operations and meet regulatory requirements. This 42 includes continuous pH and conductivity monitors required by facility permits and delisting. All 43 instruments are calibrated according to frequencies and tolerances established by the LERF/200 Area ETF 44 engineering group. Addendum B.32

--- Page 846 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I Calibrations and other maintenance actions are scheduled and tracked by LERF/200 Area ETF 2 maintenance group using a preventive maintenance database. Measuring and test equipment used for 3 instrument calibration is controlled, calibrated at specified intervals, and maintained to establish accuracy 4 limits. 5 B.7.4 Assessment and Oversight 6 Quality programs can only be effective if meaningful assessments are performed to monitor and respond 7 to issues associated with program performance. Routine assessment of data is performed as part of the 8 validation process discussed in Section B.7.5.1. 9 B.7.4.1 Assessments and Response 10 Management assessments are conducted by first line management and subject matter experts, focusing on 11 procedural adequacy, compliance, and overall effectiveness of the program. Management assessments of 12 the sample program typically include the LERF and 200 Area ETF QA representative. Each management 13 assessment has a performance objective or lines of inquiry. Examples may include personnel training, 14 proper performance of sample custody, or completeness of sampling records. 15 B.7.4.2 Reports to Management 16 Results of performance assessments, including any issues identified, are provided to the LERF and 17 200 Area ETF Facility Manager in a written report. The Facility Manager is responsible to correct all 18 findings from the report. 19 B.7.5 Verification and Validation of Analytical Data 20 The data verification and validation processes will ensure that the data resulting from the selected 21 analytical method are consistent with requirements specified in this QA/QC plan. 22 B.7.5.1 Data Verification 23 The primary data reporting will be by electronic data systems. Data verification will be performed on 24 laboratory data packages that support environmental compliance to ensure that their content is complete 25 and in order. A review of the data package will be performed to ensure that: 26 * The data package contains the required technical information. 27 * Deficiencies are identified and documented. 28 * Identified deficiencies are corrected by the laboratory and the appropriate revisions are made. 29 * Deficient pages are replaced with the laboratory corrections. 30 * A copy of the completed verification report is placed in the data file. 31 B.7.5.2 Data Validation 32 Data validation ensures that the data resulting from analytical measurements meet the quality 33 requirements specified in the QA/QC plan. Data validation will be performed on data packages that 34 support environmental compliance. 35 The following are included in data validation: 36 * Chain-of-Custody (COC) -Verify the COC shows unbroken custody from sampling through 37 receipt at the laboratory. 38 * Request analysis -Review the sample results to verify the requested analysis was performed. If 39 an alternate method was used, verify permit-required detection limits were met. 40 * Holding times -Review the sample results to verify the analyses were performed within required 41 holing times and where applicable, extraction times.

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I C. PROCESS INFORMATION 2 This addendum provides a detailed discussion of the Liquid Effluent Retention Facility (LERF) and 3 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility (200 Area ETF) processes and equipment. The LERF and 200 Area 4 ETF comprise an aqueous waste treatment system located in the 200 East Area that provides storage and 5 treatment for a variety of aqueous mixed waste. This aqueous waste includes process condensate from 6 the 242-A Evaporator and other aqueous waste generated from onsite remediation and waste management 7 activities. 8 The LERF consists of three lined surface impoundments, or basins. Aqueous waste from LERF is 9 pumped to the 200 Area ETF for treatment in a series of process units, or systems, that remove or destroy 10 essentially all of the dangerous waste constituents. The treated effluent is discharged to a State-Approved 11 Land Disposal Site (SALDS) north of the 200 West Area, under the authority of a Washington State 12 Waste Discharge Permit (Ecology 2000) and the Final Delisting (40 CFR 261, Appendix IX, Table 2). 13 Both LERF and 200 Area ETF waste processing operations are controlled in a central Control room 14 located in the 200 Area ETF building. The ETF control room is staffed continuously during ETF 15 processing operations. Processing operations are defined as when liquid transfers of any sort are 16 occurring to/from/within the LERF and ETF or when wastes are being treated at ETF'. Examples of 17 processing operations include, but are not limited to, when liquid waste are transferred to/from the LERF 18 basins [see section C. 1], during active liquid waste treatment/processing at the ETF (e.g., liquid waste 19 treatment in tanks and liquid waste movement between primary and secondary treatment train processes 20 and/or other ETF tanks [see Section C.2]), and liquid waste receipts at the load-in station [see Section 21 C.2.1]). Section C.2.5.1 describes the centralized computer system (i.e., monitor and control system or 22 MCS) that is located at the ETF control room and other locations at the ETF facility. This MCS monitors 23 the performance of the ETF operations and records alarms from various equipment as described in this 24 Addendum C and Addendum I, Inspection Requirements. At times when processing operations are not 25 occurring, the ETF Control room is not manned continuously, and alarms are monitored daily as specified 26 in Addendum I. 27 C.1 Liquid Effluent Retention Facility Process Description 28 Each of the three LERF basins has an operating capacity of 29.5-million liters. The LERF receives 29 aqueous waste through several inlets including the following: 30 * A pipeline that connects LERF with the 242-A Evaporator. 31 * A pipeline from the 200 West Area. 32 * A pipeline that connects LERF to the Load-In Station at the 200 Area ETF. 33 * A series of sample ports located at each basin. 34 Figure C.1 presents a general layout of LERF and associated pipelines. Aqueous waste from LERF is 35 pumped to the 200 Area ETF through one of two double-walled fiberglass transfer pipelines. Effluent 36 from the 200 Area ETF also can be transferred back to the LERF through one of these transfer pipelines. 37 These pipelines are equipped with leak detection located in the annulus between the inner and outer pipes. 38 In the event that these leak detectors are not in service, the pipelines are visually inspected during 39 transfers for leakage by opening the secondary containment drain lines located at the 200 Area ETF end 40 of the transfer pipelines. 41 Each basin is equipped with six available sample risers constructed of 6-inch perforated pipe. A seventh 42 sample riser in each basin is dedicated to influent aqueous waste receipt piping (except for aqueous waste 43 received from the 242-A Evaporator), and an eighth riser in each basin contains liquid level 44 instrumentation. I Liquid transfers does not include standard facility operations of liquid recirculation (e.g. for pump seals), sanitary water and cooling water, and outdoor rainwater management activities. Addendum C.6

--- Page 861 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 Each riser extends along the sides of each basin from the top to the bottom of the basin and allows 2 samples to be collected from any depth. Personnel access to these sample ports is from the perimeter area 3 of the basins. A catch basin is provided at the northwest corner of each LERF basin for aboveground 4 piping and manifolds for transfer pumps. Aqueous waste from the 242-A Evaporator is transferred 5 through piping which ties into piping at the catch basins. Under routine operations, a submersible pump 6 is used to transfer aqueous waste from a LERF basin to the 200 Area ETF for processing or for basin-to- 7 basin transfers. This pump is connected to a fixed manifold on one of four available risers. 8 Each basin consists of a multilayer liner system supported by a concrete anchor wall around the basin 9 perimeter and a soil-bentonite clay underlayment. The multilayer liner system consists of a primary liner 10 in contact with the aqueous waste, a layer of bentonite carpet, a geonet, a geotextile, a gravel layer, and a 11 secondary liner that rests on the bentonite underlayment. Any aqueous waste leakage through the primary 12 liner flows through the geonet and gravel to a leachate collection system. The leachate flows to a sump at 13 the northwest corner of each basin, where the leachate is pumped up the side slope and back into the basin 14 above the primary liner. Each liner is constructed of high-density polyethylene. A floating cover made of 15 very low-density polyethylene is stretched over each basin above the primary liner. These covers serve to 16 keep unwanted material from entering the basins, and to minimize evaporation of the liquid contents. 17 C.2 Effluent Treatment Facility Process Description 18 The 200 Area ETF is designed as a flexible treatment system that provides treatment for contaminants 19 anticipated in process condensate and other onsite aqueous waste. The design influent flow rate into the 20 200 Area ETF is approximately 570 liters per minute, with planned outages for activities such as 21 maintenance on the 200 Area ETF systems. Maintenance outages typically are scheduled between 22 treating a batch of aqueous waste, referred to as treatment campaigns. The effluent flow (or volume) is 23 equivalent to the influent flow (or volume). 24 The 200 Area ETF generally receives aqueous waste directly from the LERF. However, aqueous waste 25 also can be transferred from tanker trucks at the Load-In Station to the 200 Area ETF and from containers 26 (e.g., carboys, drums) directly to ETF. Aqueous waste is treated and stored in the 200 Area ETF process 27 areas in a series of tank systems, referred to as process units. Within the ETF, waste also is managed in 28 containers through treatment and/or storage. Figure C.2 provides the relative locations of the process and 29 container storage areas within the ETF. 30 The process units are grouped in either the primary or the secondary treatment train. The primary 31 treatment train provides for the removal or destruction of contaminants. Typically, the secondary 32 treatment train processes the waste by-products from the primary treatment train by reducing the volume 33 of waste. In the secondary treatment train, contaminants are concentrated and dried to a powder. The 34 liquid fraction is routed to the primary treatment train. Figure C.3 provides an overview of the layout of 35 the ETF, 2025E Building). Figure C.4 presents the 200 Area ETF floor plan, the relative locations of the 36 individual process units and associated tanks within the ETF, and the location of the Load-In Station. 37 The dry powder waste and maintenance and operations waste are containerized and stored or treated in 38 the container storage areas or in collection or treatment areas within the Process Area. Secondary 39 containment is provided for all containers and tank systems (including ancillary equipment) housed 40 within the ETF. The trenches and floor of the 200 Area ETF comprise the secondary containment system. 41 The floor includes approximately a 15.2-centimeter rise (berm) along the containing walls of the process 42 and container storage areas. Any spilled or leaked material from within the process area or container 43 storage area is collected into trenches that feed into either sump tank I or sump tank 2. 44 From these sump tanks, the spilled or leaked material (i.e., waste) is fed to either the surge tank and 45 processed in the primary treatment train or the secondary waste receiving tanks and processed in the 46 secondary treatment train. All tank systems outside of the 200 Area ETF are provided with a secondary 47 containment system. 48 In the following sections, several figures are provided that present general illustrations of the treatment 49 units and the relation to the process. Addendum C.7

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 C.2.1 Load-in Station 2 The 200 Area ETF receives aqueous waste from LERF or the Load-In Station. The 200 Area ETF 3 Load-In Station, located due east of the surge tank and outside of the perimeter fence (Figure C.4), was 4 designed and constructed to provide the capability to unload, store, and transfer aqueous waste to the 5 LERF or 200 Area ETF from tanker trucks and other containers (such as drums). The Load-In Station 6 consists of two truck bays equipped with load-in tanks, transfer pumps, filtration system, level 7 instrumentation for tanker trucks, leak detection capabilities for the containment basin and transfer line, 8 and an underground transfer line that connects to lines in the surge tank berm, allowing transfers to either 9 the 200 Area ETF surge tank or LERF. The Load-In Station is covered with a steel building for weather 10 protection. Tanker trucks and other containers are used to unload aqueous waste at the Load-In Station. 11 To perform unloading, the tanker truck is positioned on a truck pad, a 'load-in' transfer line is connected 12 to the truck, and the tanker contents are pumped into one of the Load-In Station tanks, the surge tank, or 13 directly to the LERF. For container unloading, the container is placed on the truck pad and the container 14 contents are pumped into one of the Load-In Station tanks, the surge tank, or directly to the LERF. 15 During unloading operations, solids may be removed from the waste by pumping the contents of the 16 tanker truck or container through a filtration system. If solids removal is not needed, the filtration system 17 is not used and the solution is transferred directly to the Load-In Station tanks, surge tank, or to LERF. 18 Any leaks at the Load-In Station drain to the sump. A leak detector in the sump alarms locally and in the 19 200 Area ETF control room. Alarms are monitored continuously in the control room during Load-in 20 Station transfers and at least daily at times when waste is not being received at the Load-In Station. 21 Alternatively, leaks can be visually detected. 22 C.2.2 Effluent Treatment Facility Operating Configuration 23 Because the operating configuration of the 200 Area ETF can be adjusted or modified, most aqueous 24 waste streams can be effectively treated to below Delisting and Discharge Permit limits. The operating 25 configuration of the 200 Area ETF depends on the unique chemistry of an aqueous waste stream(s). 26 Before an aqueous waste stream is accepted for treatment, the waste is characterized and evaluated. 27 Information from the characterization is used to adjust the treatment process or change the configuration 28 of the 200 Area ETF process units, as necessary, to optimize the treatment process for a particular 29 aqueous waste stream. 30 Typically, an aqueous waste is processed first in the primary treatment train, where the 200 Area ETF is 31 configured to process an aqueous waste through the UV/OX unit first, followed by the RO unit. 32 However, under an alternate configuration, an aqueous waste could be processed in the RO unit first. For 33 example, high concentrations of nitrates in an aqueous waste might interfere with the performance of the 34 UV/OX. In this case, the 200 Area ETF could be configured to process the waste in the RO unit before 35 the UV/OX unit. 36 The flexibility of the 200 Area ETF also allows some aqueous waste to be processed in the secondary 37 treatment train first. For example, for small volume aqueous waste with high concentrations of some 38 anions and metals, the approach could be to first process the waste stream in the secondary treatment 39 train. This approach would prevent premature fouling or scaling of the RO unit. The liquid portion (i.e., 40 untreated overheads from the 200 Area ETF evaporator and thin film dryer) would be sent to the primary 41 treatment train. 42 Figure C.5 and Figure C.6 provide example process flow diagrams for two different operating 43 configurations. 44 C.2.3 Primary Treatment Train 45 The primary treatment train consists of the following processes: 46 * Influent Receipt/Surge tank -inlet, surge capacity. 47 * Filtration -for suspended solids removal. Addendum C.8

--- Page 863 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 * UV/OX -organic destruction. 2 * pH adjustment -waste neutralization. 3 * Hydrogen peroxide decomposition -removal of excess hydrogen peroxide. 4 * Degasification -removal of carbon dioxide. 5 * RO -removal of dissolved solids. 6 * IX -removal of dissolved solids. 7 * Verification -holding tanks during verification. 8 Influent Receipt/Surge Tank. Depending on the configuration of the ETF, the surge tank is one inlet 9 used to feed an aqueous waste into the 200 Area ETF for treatment. In Configuration 1 (Figure C.5), the 10 surge tank is the first component downstream of the LERF. The surge tank provides a storage/surge 11 volume for chemical pretreatment and controls feed flow rates from the LERF to the 200 Area ETF. 12 However, in Configuration 2 (Figure C.6), aqueous waste from LERF is fed directly into the treatment 13 units. In this configuration, the surge tank receives aqueous waste, which has been processed in the RO 14 units, and provides the feed stream to the remaining downstream process units. In yet another 15 configuration, some small volume aqueous waste could be received into the secondary treatment train 16 first for processing. In this case, the aqueous waste would be received directly into the secondary waste 17 receiving tanks. Finally, the surge tank also receives waste extracted from various systems within the 18 primary and secondary treatment train while in operation. 19 The surge tank is located outside the 200 Area ETF on the south side. In the surge tank (Fiyure C.7), the 20 pH of an aqueous waste is adjusted using the metered addition of sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide, as 21 necessary, to prepare the waste for treatment in downstream processes. In addition, hydrogen peroxide or 22 biocides could be added to control biological growth in the surge tank. A pump recirculates the contents 23 in the surge tank, mixing the chemical reagents with the waste to a uniform pH. 24 Filtration. Two primary filter systems remove suspended particles in an aqueous waste: a rough filter 25 removes the larger particulates, while a fine filter removes the smaller particulates. The location of these 26 filters depends on the configuration of the primary treatment train. However, the filters normally are 27 located upstream of the RO units. 28 The solids accumulating on these filter elements are backwashed to the secondary waste receiving tanks 29 with pulses of compressed air and water, forcing water back through the filter. The backwash operation is 30 initiated either automatically by a rise in differential pressure across the filter or manually by an operator. 31 The filters are cleaned chemically when the backwashing process does not facilitate acceptable filter 32 performance. 33 Auxiliary fine and rough filters (e.g., disposable filters) have been installed to provide additional filtration 34 capabilities. Depending on the configuration of the ETF, the auxiliary filters are operated either in series 35 with the primary filters to provide additional filtration or in parallel, instead of the primary fine and rough 36 filters, to allow cleaning/maintenance of the primary fine and rough filters while the primary treatment 37 train is in operation. 38 Ultraviolet Light/Oxidation. Organic compounds contained in an aqueous waste stream are destroyed 39 in the UV/OX system (Fiaure C.8). Hydrogen peroxide is mixed with the waste. 40 The UV/OX system uses the photochemical reaction of UV light on hydrogen peroxide to form hydroxyl 41 radicals and other reactive species that oxidize the organic compounds. The final products of the 42 complete reaction are carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic ions. 43 Organic destruction is accomplished in two UV/OX units operating in parallel. During the UV/OX 44 process, the aqueous waste passes through reaction chambers where hydrogen peroxide is added. While 45 in the UV/OX system, the temperature of an aqueous waste is monitored. Heat exchangers are used to 46 reduce the temperature of the waste should the temperature of the waste approach the upper limits for the 47 UV/OX or RO systems. Addendum C.9

--- Page 864 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 pH Adjustment. The pH of a waste stream is monitored and controlled at different points throughout the 2 treatment process. Within the primary treatment train, the pH of a waste can be adjusted with sulfuric 3 acid or sodium hydroxide to optimize operation of downstream treatment processes or adjusted before 4 final discharge. For example, the pH of an aqueous waste would be adjusted in the pH adjustment tank 5 after the UV/OX process and before the RO process. In this example, pH is adjusted to cause certain 6 chemical species such as ammonia to form ammonium sulfate, thereby increasing the rejection rate of the 7 RO. 8 Hydrogen Peroxide Decomposition. Typically, hydrogen peroxide added into the UV/OX system is not 9 consumed completely by the system. Because hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizer, the residual 10 hydrogen peroxide from the UV/OX system is removed to protect the downstream equipment. The 11 hydrogen peroxide decomposer uses a catalyst to break down the hydrogen peroxide that is not consumed 12 completely in the process of organic destruction. The aqueous waste is sent through a column that breaks 13 down the hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. The gas generated by the decomposition of the 14 hydrogen peroxide is vented to the vessel off gas system. 15 Degasification. The degasification column is used to purge dissolved carbon dioxide from the aqueous 16 waste to reduce the carbonate loading to downstream dissolved solids removal processes within the 17 200 Area ETF primary treatment train. The purged carbon dioxide is vented to the vessel off gas system. 18 Reverse Osmosis. The RO system (Figure C.9) uses pressure to force clean water molecules through 19 semi-permeable membranes while keeping the larger molecule contaminants, such as dissolved solids, 20 and large molecular weight organic materials, in the membrane. The RO process uses a staged 21 configuration to maximize water recovery. The process produces two separate streams, including a clean 22 'permeate' and a concentrate (or retentate), which are concentrated as much as possible to minimize the 23 amount of secondary waste produced. 24 The RO process is divided into first and second stages. Aqueous waste is fed to the first RO stage from 25 the RO feed tank. The secondary waste receiving tanks of the secondary treatment train receive the 26 retentate removed from the first RO stage, while the second RO stage receives the permeate (i.e., 'treated' 27 aqueous waste from the first RO stage). In the second RO stage, the retentate is sent to the first stage RO 28 feed tank while the permeate is sent to the IX system or to the surge tank, depending on the configuration 29 of the ETF. 30 Two support systems facilitate this process. An anti-scale system injects scale inhibitors as needed into 31 the feed waste to prevent scale from forming on the membrane surface. A clean-in-place system using 32 cleaning agents, such as descalants and surfactants, cleans the membrane pores of surface and subsurface 33 deposits that have fouled the membranes. 34 Ion Exchange. Because the RO process removes most of the dissolved solids in an aqueous waste, the 35 IX process (Figure C.10) acts as a polishing unit. The IX system consists of three columns containing 36 beds of cation and/or anion resins. This system is designed to allow for regeneration of resins and 37 maintenance of one column while the other two are in operation. Though the two columns generally are 38 operated in series, the two columns also can be operated in parallel or individually. 39 Typically, the two columns in operation are arranged in a primary/secondary (lead/lag) configuration, and 40 the third (regenerated) column is maintained in standby. 41 When dissolved solids breakthrough the first IX column and are detected by a conductivity sensor, this 42 column is removed from service for regeneration, and the second column replaces the first column and 43 the third column is placed into service. The column normally is regenerated using sulfuric acid and 44 sodium hydroxide. The resulting regeneration waste is collected in the secondary waste receiving tanks. 45 Spent resins are transferred into a disposal container should regeneration of the IX resins become 46 inefficient Free water is removed from the container and returned to the surge tank. Dewatered resins are 47 transferred to a final storage/disposal point. Addendum C.10

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I Verification. The three verification tanks (Figure C. 11) are used to hold the treated effluent while a 2 determination is made that the effluent meets discharge limits. The effluent can be returned to the 3 primary treatment train for additional treatment, or to the LERF, should a treated effluent not meet 4 Discharge Permit or Final Delisting requirements. 5 The three verification tanks alternate between three operating modes: receiving treated effluent, holding 6 treated effluent during laboratory analysis and verification, or discharging verified effluent. Treated 7 effluent may also be returned to the 200 Area ETF to provide 'clean' service water for operational and 8 maintenance functions, e.g., for boiler water and for backwashing the filters. This recycling keeps the 9 quantity of fresh water used to a minimum. 10 C.2.4 Secondary Treatment Train 11 The secondary treatment system typically receives and processes the following by-products generated 12 from the primary treatment train: concentrate from the first RO stage, filter backwash, regeneration waste 13 from the ion exchange system, and spillage or overflow received into the process sumps. Depending on 14 the operating configuration, however, some aqueous waste could be processed in the secondary treatment 15 train before the primary treatment train (refer to Figure C.5 and Figure C.6 for example operating 16 configurations). 17 The secondary treatment train provides the following processes: 18 * Secondary waste receiving -tank receiving and chemical addition. 19 * Evaporation -concentrates secondary waste streams. 20 * Concentrate staging -concentrate receipt, pH adjustment, and chemical addition. 21 * Thin film drying -dewatering of secondary waste streams. 22 * Container handling -packaging of dewatered secondary waste. 23 Secondary Waste Receiving. Waste to be processed in the secondary treatment train is received into two 24 secondary waste receiving tanks, where the pH can be adjusted with sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide for 25 optimum evaporator performance. Chemicals, such as reducing agents, may be added to waste in the 26 secondary waste receiving tanks to reduce the toxicity or mobility of constituents in the powder. 27 Evaporation. The 200 Area ETF evaporator is fed alternately by the two secondary waste receiving 28 tanks. One tank serves as a waste receiver while the other tank is operated as the feed tank. The 29 200 Area ETF evaporator vessel (also referred to as the vapor body) is the principal component of the 30 evaporation process (Figure C.12). 31 Feed from the secondary waste receiving tanks is pumped through a heater to the recirculation loop of the 32 200 Area ETF evaporator. In this loop, concentrated waste is recirculated from the 200 Area ETF 33 evaporator, to a heater, and back into the evaporator where vaporization occurs. As water leaves the 34 evaporator system in the vapor phase, the concentration of the waste in the evaporator increases. When 35 the concentration of the waste reaches the appropriate density, a portion of the concentrate is pumped to 36 one of the concentrate tanks. 37 The vapor that is released from the 200 Area ETF evaporator is routed to the entrainment separator, where 38 water droplets and/or particulates are separated from the vapor. The 'cleaned' vapor is routed to the vapor 39 compressor and converted to steam. 40 The steam from the vapor compressor is sent to the heater (reboiler) and used to heat the recirculating 41 concentrate in the 200 Area ETF evaporator. From the heater, the steam is condensed and fed to the 42 distillate flash tank, where the saturated condensate received from the heater drops to atmospheric 43 pressure and cools to the normal boiling point through partial flashing (rapid vaporization caused by a 44 pressure reduction). The resulting distillate is routed to the surge tank. The non-condensable vapors, 45 such as air, are vented through a vent gas cooler to the vessel off gas system. Addendum C. 11

--- Page 866 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I Concentrate Staging. The concentrate tanks make up the head end of the thin film drying process. From 2 the 200 Area ETF evaporator, concentrate is pumped into two concentrate tanks, and pH adjusted 3 chemicals, such as reducing agents, may be added to reduce the toxicity or mobility of constituents when 4 converted to powder. Waste is transferred from the concentrate tanks to the thin film dryer for conversion 5 to a powder. The concentrate tanks function alternately between concentrate receiver and feed tank for 6 the thin film dryer. However, one tank may serve as both concentrate receiver and feed tank. 7 Because low solubility solids (i.e., calcium and magnesium sulfate) tend to settle in the concentrate tanks, 8 these solids must be removed to prevent fouling and to protect the thin film dryer, and to maintain 9 concentrate tank capacity. 10 Thin Film Drying. From the concentrate tanks, feed is pumped to the thin film dryer (Figure C.13) that 11 is heated by steam. As the concentrated waste flows down the length of the dryer, the waste is dried. The 12 dried film, or powder, is scraped off the dryer cylinder by blades attached to a rotating shaft. The powder 13 is funneled through a cone-shaped powder hopper at the bottom of the dryer and into the Container 14 Handling System. 15 Overhead vapor released by the drying of the concentrate is condensed in the distillate condenser. Excess 16 heat is removed from the distillate by a water-cooled heat exchanger. Part of the distillate is circulated 17 back to the condenser spray nozzles. The remaining distillate is pumped to the surge tank. Any 18 noncondensible vapors and particulates from the spray condenser are exhausted to the vessel off gas 19 system. 20 Container Handling. Before an empty container is moved into the Container Handling System 21 (Figure C.14), the lid is removed and the container is placed on a conveyor. The containers are moved 22 into the container filling area after passing through an air lock. The empty container is located under the 23 thin film dryer, and raised into position. The container is sealed to the thin film dryer and a rotary valve 24 begins the transfer of powder to the empty container. Air displaced from the container is vented to the 25 distillate condenser attached to the 200 Area ETF evaporator that exhausts to the vessel off gas system. 26 The container is filled to a predetermined level, then lowered from the thin film dryer and moved along a 27 conveyor. The filled container is manually recapped, and moved along the conveyor to the airlock. At 28 the airlock, the container is moved onto the conveyor by remote control. The airlock is opened, the smear 29 sample (surface wipe) is taken, and the contamination level counted. A 'C' ring is installed to secure the 30 container lid. If the container has contaminated material on the outside, the container is wiped down and 31 retested. Filled containers that pass the smear test are labeled, placed on pallets, and moved by forklift to 32 the filled container storage area. Section C.3 provides a more detailed discussion of container handling. 33 C.2.5 Other Effluent Treatment Facility Systems 34 The 200 Area ETF is provided with support systems that facilitate treatment in the primary and secondary 35 treatment trains and that provide for worker safety and environmental protection. An overview of the 36 following systems is provided: 37 * Monitor and control system 38 * Vessel off gas system 39 * Sump collection system 40 * Chemical injection feed system 41 * Verification tank recycle system 42 * Utilities 43 C.2.5.1 Monitor and Control System 44 The operation of the 200 Area ETF is monitored and controlled by a centralized computer system 45 (i.e., monitor and control system or MCS). Addendum C.12

--- Page 867 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I The MCS continuously monitors data from various field indicators, such as pH, flow, tank level, 2 temperature, pressure, conductivity, alarm status, and valve switch positions. Data gathered by the MCS 3 enable operations and engineering personnel to document and adjust the operation of the ETF. 4 Emergency communications equipment and warning systems (e.g. fire alarms and evacuation alarms) are 5 included in Addendum J, Contingency Plan. These emergency response notification alarms are 6 monitored continuously at central Hanford Facility locations (e.g. Hanford Fire Station) and do not rely 7 on staff being present in the ETF control room for notification and response. 8 C.2.5.2 Vessel Off gas System 9 Ventilation for various tanks and vessels is provided through the vessel off gas system. The system 10 includes a moisture separator, duct heater, pre-filter, high-efficiency particulate air filters, carbon absorber 11 (when required to reduce organic emissions), exhaust fans, and ductwork. Gasses ventilated from the 12 tanks and vessels enter the exhaust system through the connected ductwork. The vessel off gas system 13 draws vapors and gasses off the following tanks and treatment systems: 14 * Surge tank 15 * Vent gas cooler (off the ETF evaporator/distillate flash tank) 16 * pH adjustment tank 17 * Concentrate tanks 18 * Degasification system 19 * First and second RO stages 20 * Dry powder hopper 21 * Effluent pH adjustment tank 22 * Drum capping station 23 * Secondary waste receiving tanks 24 * Distillate condenser (off the thin film dryer) 25 * Sump tanks 1 and 2 26 The vessel off gas system maintains a negative pressure with respect to the atmosphere, which produces a 27 slight vacuum within tanks, vessels, and ancillary equipment for the containment of gas vapor. This 28 system also provides for the collection, monitoring, and treatment of confined airborne in-vessel 29 contaminants to preclude over-pressurization. The high-efficiency particulate air filters remove 30 particulates and condensate from the air stream before these are discharged to the heating, ventilation, and 31 air conditioning system. 32 C.2.5.3 Sump Collection System 33 Sump tanks I and 2 compose the sump collection system that provides containment of waste streams and 34 liquid overflow associated with the 200 Area ETF processes. The process area floor is sloped to two 35 separate trenches that each drain to a sump tank located under the floor of the 200 Area ETF 36 (Figure C.15). One trench runs the length of the primary treatment train and drains to Sump Tank 2, 37 located underneath the verification tank pump floor. The second trench collects spillage primarily from 38 the secondary treatment train and flows to Sump Tank 1, located near the 200 Area ETF evaporator. 39 Sump tanks I and 2 are located below floor level (Figure C. 15). An eductor in these tanks prevents 40 sludge from accumulating. 41 C.2.5.4 Chemical Injection Feed System 42 At several points within the primary and secondary treatment trains, sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide 43 (or dilute solutions of these reagents) are metered into specific process units to adjust the pH. For 44 example, a dilute solution of 4 percent sulfuric acid and 4 percent sodium hydroxide could be added to 45 the secondary waste receiving tanks to optimize the evaporation process. Addendum C.13

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I C.2.5.5 Verification Tank Recycle System 2 To reduce the amount of water added to the process, verification tank water (i.e., verified effluent) is 3 recycled throughout the 200 Area ETF process. Tanks and ancillary equipment that use verification tank 4 water include: 5 * 4 percent H2SO4 solution tank and ancillary equipment. 6 * 4 percent NaOH solution tank and ancillary equipment. 7 * Clean-in-place tank and ancillary equipment. 8 * IX columns (during resin regeneration). 9 * 200 Area ETF evaporator boiler and ancillary equipment. 10 * Thin film dryer boiler and ancillary equipment 11 * Seal water system. 12 In addition, verification tank water is used extensively during maintenance activities. For example, it may 13 be used to flush piping systems or to confirm the integrity of piping, a process tank or tank truck. 14 C.2.5.6 Utilities 15 The 200 Area ETF maintains the following utility supply systems required for the operation of the ETF: 16 * Cooling water system -removes heat from process water via heat exchangers and a cooling 17 tower. 18 * Compressed air system -provides air to process equipment and instrumentation. 19 * Seal water system -provides cool, clean, pressurized water to process equipment for pump seal 20 cooling and pump seal lubrication, and provides protection against failure and fluid leakage. 21 * Demineralized water system -removes solids from raw water system to produce high quality, low 22 ion-content, water for steam boilers, and for the hydrogen peroxide feed system. 23 * Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system -provides continuous heating, cooling, and air 24 humidity control throughout the ETF. 25 The following utilities support 200 Area ETF activities: 26 * Electrical power 27 * Sanitary water 28 * Communication systems 29 * Raw water 30 C.3 Containers 31 This section provides specific information on container storage and treatment operations at the 200 Area 32 ETF, including descriptions of containers, labeling, and secondary containment structures. 33 A list of dangerous and/or mixed waste managed in containers at the 200 Area ETF is presented in 34 Addendum A. The types of dangerous and/or mixed waste managed in containers in the 200 Area ETF 35 could include: 36 * Secondary waste powder generated from the treatment process. 37 * Aqueous waste received from other Hanford site sources awaiting treatment. 38 * Miscellaneous waste generated by operations and maintenance activities. 39 The secondary treatment train processes the waste by-products from the primary treatment train, which 40 are concentrated and dried into a powder. Containers are filled with dry powder waste from the thin film 41 dryer via a remotely controlled system. Containers of aqueous waste received from other Hanford site 42 sources are stored at 200 Area ETF until their contents can be transferred to the process for treatment. Addendum C.14

--- Page 869 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 The waste is usually transferred to the secondary waste receiving or concentration tanks. Miscellaneous 2 waste generated from maintenance and operations activities are stored at the ETF. The waste could 3 include process waste, such as used filter elements; spent RO membranes; damaged equipment, and 4 decontamination and maintenance waste, such as contaminated rags, gloves, and other personal protective 5 equipment. Containers of miscellaneous waste which have free liquids generally are packaged with 6 absorbents. 7 Several container collection areas could be located within the 200 Area ETF process and container 8 handling areas. These collection areas are used only to accumulate waste in containers. Once a container 9 is filled, the container is transferred to a container storage area (Figure C.3 and Figure C.4), to another 10 TSD unit, or to a less-than-90-day storage pad. Containers stored in the additional storage area 11 (Figure C.4) are elevated or otherwise protected from contact with accumulated liquids. The container 12 storage area within 200 Area ETF is a 22.9 x 8.5-meter room located adjacent to the 200 Area ETF 13 process areas. The containers within the container storage area are clearly labeled, and access to these 14 containers is limited by barriers and by administrative controls. The 200 Area ETF floor provides 15 secondary containment, and the 200 Area ETF roof and walls protects all containers from exposure to the 16 elements. 17 Waste also could be placed in containers for treatment as indicated in Addendum A. For example, sludge 18 that accumulates in the bottoms of the process tanks is removed periodically and placed into containers. 19 In this example, the waste is solidified by decanting the supemate from the container and the remainder of 20 the waste is allowed to evaporate, or absorbents are added, as necessary, to address remaining liquids. 21 Following treatment, this waste either is stored at the 200 Area ETF or transferred to another treatment, 22 storage, and disposal (TSD) unit. 23 C.3.1 Description of Containers 24 The containers used to collect and store dry powder waste are 208-liter steel containers. Most of the 25 aqueous waste received at 200 Area ETF, and maintenance and operation waste generated, are stored in 26 208-liter steel or plastic containers; however, in a few cases, the size of the container could vary to 27 accommodate the size of a particular waste. For example, some process waste, such as spent filters, 28 might not fit into a 208-liter container. In the case of spent resin from the IX columns, the resin is 29 dewatered, and could be packaged in a special disposal container. In these few cases, specially sized 30 containers could be required. In all cases, however, only approved containers are used and are compatible 31 with the associated waste. Typically, 208-liter containers are used for treatment. 32 Current operating practices indicate the use of new 208-liter containers that have either a polyethylene 33 liner or a protective coating. Any reused or reconditioned container is inspected for container integrity 34 before use. Overpack containers are available for use with damaged containers. Overpack containers 35 typically are unlined steel or polyethylene. 36 Per Addendum A, a maximum of 147,630 liters of dangerous and/or mixed waste could be stored in 37 containers in the 200 Area ETF. 38 C.3.2 Container Management Practices 39 Before use, each container is checked for signs of damage such as dents, distortion, corrosion, or 40 scratched coating. 41 For dry powder loading, empty containers on pallets are raised by a forklift and manually placed on the 42 conveyor that transports the containers to the automatic filling station in the container handling room 43 (Figure C.14). The container lids are removed and replaced manually following the filling sequence. 44 After filling, containers exit the container handling room via the filled drum conveyor. Locking rings are 45 installed, the container label is affixed, and the container is moved by dolly or forklift to the container 46 storage area. 47 Addendum C.15

--- Page 870 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 Before receipt at 200 Area ETF, each container from other Hanford site sources is inspected for leaks, 2 signs of damage, and a loose lid. The identification number on each container is checked to ensure the 3 proper container is received. The containers are typically placed on pallets and moved by dolly or forklift 4 to the container storage area. These containers are later moved to the process area and the contents 5 transferred to the process for treatment. 6 Containers used for storing maintenance and operations secondary waste are labeled before being placed 7 in the container storage area or in a collection area. Lids are secured on these containers when not being 8 filled. When the containers in a collection area are full, the containers are transferred by dolly or forklift 9 to the container storage area or to an appropriate TSD unit. Containers used for treating waste also are 10 labeled. The lids on these containers are removed as required to allow for treatment. During treatment, 11 access to these containers is controlled through physical barriers and/or administrative controls. 12 The filled containers in the container storage area are inventoried, checked for proper labeling, and placed 13 on pallets or in a separate containment device as necessary. Each pallet is moved by forklift. Within the 14 container storage area, palletized containers are stacked no more than three pallets high and in rows no 15 more than two containers wide. Unobstructed aisles with a minimum of 76-centimeter aisle space 16 separate rows. 17 C.3.3 Container Labeling 18 Labels are affixed on containers used to store dry powder when the containers leave the container 19 handling room. Labels are affixed on other waste containers before use. Every container is labeled with 20 the date that the container was filled. Appropriate major risk labels, such as "corrosive", "toxic", or 21 "F-listed", also are added. Each container also has a label with an identification number for tracking 22 purposes. 23 C.3.4 Containment Requirements for Managing Containers 24 Secondary containment is provided in the container management areas within the ETF. The secondary 25 containment provided for tank systems also serves the container management areas. This section 26 describes the design and operation of the secondary containment structure for these areas. 27 C.3.4.1 Secondary Containment System Design 28 For the container management areas, the reinforced concrete floor and a 15.2-centimeter rise (berm) along 29 the walls of the container storage area of the 200 Area ETF provides secondary containment. The 30 engineering assessment required for tanks (Mausshardt 1995) also describes the design and construction 31 of the secondary containment provided for the 200 Area ETF container management areas. All systems 32 were designed to national codes and standards (e.g., American Society for Testing Materials, American 33 Concrete Institute standards). 34 The floor is composed of cast-in-place, pre-formed concrete slabs, and has a minimum thickness of 15.2 35 centimeters. All slab joints and floor and wall joints have water stops installed at the mid-depth of the 36 slab. In addition, filler was applied to each joint. The floor and berms are coated with a chemically 37 resistant; high-solids epoxy coating system consisting of primer and top coating. This coating material is 38 compatible with the waste managed in containers and is an integral part of the secondary containment 39 system for containers. 40 The floor is sloped to drain any solution in the container storage area to floor drains along the west wall. 41 Each floor drain consists of a grating over a 20.3-centimeter diameter drain port connected to a 4-inch 42 polyvinyl chloride transfer pipe. The pipe passes under this wall and connects to a trench running along 43 the east wall of the adjacent process area. This trench drains solution to sump tank 1. 44 The container storage area is separated from the process area by a common wall and a door for access to 45 the two areas (Figure C.3). These two areas also share a common floor and trenches that, with the 46 15.2-centimeter rise of the containing walls, form the secondary containment system for the process area 47 and the container storage area. Addendum C.16

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I C.3.4.2 Structural Integrity of Base 2 Engineering calculations were performed showing the floor of the container storage area is capable of 3 supporting the weight of containers. These calculations were reviewed and certified by a professional 4 engineer (Mausshardt 1995). The concrete was inspected for damage during construction. Cracks were 5 identified and repaired to the satisfaction of the professional engineer. Documentation of these 6 certifications is included in the engineering assessment (Mausshardt 1995). 7 C.3.4.3 Containment System Capacity 8 The container storage area is primarily used to store dry powder, aqueous waste awaiting treatment, and 9 maintenance and operation waste. Where appropriate, absorbents are added to fix any trace liquids 10 present. Large volumes of liquid are not stored in the container storage area. However, liquids might be 11 present in those containers that are in the treatment process. The maximum volume of waste that can be 12 stored in containers in the container storage area is 147,630 liters. 13 Because they are interconnected by floor drains, both the process area and the container storage area are 14 considered in the containment system capacity. The volume available for secondary containment in the 15 process area is approximately 68,000 liters, as discussed in the engineering assessment (Mausshardt 16 1995). Using the dimensions of the container storage area (23.6 by 8.5 by 0.2 meters), and assuming that 17 50 percent of the floor area is occupied by containers, the volume of the container storage area is 18 15,300 liters. The Truck Bay loading areas (see Figure C.4) also provides 10,500 liters of containment as 19 it is connected to the other two areas. The combined volume of the Truck Bay loading areas and process 20 area, and container handling area available for secondary containment, is 93,800 liters. This volume is 21 greater than 10 percent of the maximum total volume of containers allowed for storage in the ETF, as 22 discussed previously. 23 C.3.4.4 Control of Run-on 24 The container management areas are located within the ETF, which serves to prevent run-on of 25 precipitation. 26 C.3.4.5 Removal of Liquids from Containment Systems 27 The container storage area is equipped with drains that route solution to a trench in the process area, 28 which drains to sump tank 1. The sump tanks are equipped with alarms that notify operating personnel 29 that a leak is occurring. The sump tanks also are equipped with pumps to transfer waste to the surge tank 30 or the secondary treatment train. 31 C.3.4.6 Prevention of Ignitable, Reactive, and Incompatible Wastes in Containers 32 Individual waste types (i.e., ignitable, corrosive, and reactive) are stored in separate containers. A waste 33 that could be incompatible with other wastes is separated and protected from the incompatible waste. 34 Incompatible wastes are evaluated using the methodology documented in 40 CFR 264, Appendix V. For 35 example, acidic and caustic wastes are stored in separate containers. Free liquids are absorbed in 36 miscellaneous waste containers that hold incompatible waste. Additionally, ETF-specific packaging 37 requirements for these types of waste provide extra containment with each individual container. For 38 example, each item of acidic waste is individually bagged and sealed within a lined container. 39 C.4 Tank Systems 40 This section provides specific information on tank systems and process units. This section also includes a 41 discussion on the types of waste to be managed in the tanks, tank design information, integrity 42 assessments, and additional information on the 200 Area ETF tanks that treat and store dangerous and/or 43 mixed waste. The 200 Area ETF dangerous waste tanks are identified in Section C.4.1.1, and the relative 44 locations of the tanks and process units in the 200 Area ETF are presented in Figure C.3. Addendum C.17

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I C.4.1 Design Requirements 2 The following sections provide an overview of the design specifications for the tanks within the ETF. A 3 separate discussion on the design of the process units also is provided. In accordance with the new tank 4 system requirements of WAC 173-303-640(3), the following tank components and specifications were 5 assessed: 6 * Dimensions, capacities, wall thicknesses, and pipe connections. 7 * Materials of construction and linings and compatibility of materials with the waste being 8 processed. 9 * Materials of construction of foundations and structural supports. 10 * Review of design codes and standards used in construction. 11 * Review of structural design calculations, including seismic design basis. 12 * Waste characteristics and the effects of waste on corrosion. 13 This assessment was documented in the Final RCRA Information Needs Report (Mausshardt 1995; the 14 engineering assessment performed for the 200 Area ETF tank systems by an independent professional 15 engineer. A similar assessment of design requirements was performed for Load-in tanks 59A-TK-109 16 and -117 and is documented in 200 Area Effluent BAT/AKART Implementation, ETF Truck Load-in 17 Facility, Project W-291H Integrity Assessment Report (KEH 1994). An assessment was also performed 18 when Load-in tank 59A-TK-1 was placed into service for receipt of dangerous and mixed wastes. The 19 assessment is documented in 200 Area ETF Purgewater Unloading Facility Tank System Integrity 20 Assessment (HNF 2009a). 21 The specifications for the preparation, design, and construction of the tank systems at the 200 Area ETF 22 are documented in the Design Construction Specification, Project C-018H, 242-A Evaporator/PUREX 23 Plant Process Condensate Treatment Facility (WHC 1992a). The preparation, design, and construction 24 of Load-in tanks 59A-TK-109 and -117 are provided in the construction specifications in Project W-291, 25 200 Area Effluent BAT/AKART Implementation ETF Truck Load-in Facility (KEH 1994). The 26 preparation, design and construction of Load-in 59A-TK-1 are documented in Purgewater Unloading 27 Facility Project Documentation (HNF 2009b). 28 Most of the tanks in the 200 Area ETF are constructed of stainless steel. According to the design of the 29 ETF, it was determined stainless steel would provide adequate corrosion protection for these tanks. 30 Exceptions include Load-in tank 59A-TK-1, which is constructed of fiberglass-reinforced plastic and the 31 verification tanks, which are constructed of carbon steel with an epoxy coating. The 200 Area ETF 32 evaporator/vapor body (and the internal surfaces of the thin film dryer) is constructed of a corrosion 33 resistant alloy, known as alloy 625, to address the specific corrosion concerns in the secondary treatment 34 train. Finally, the hydrogen peroxide decomposer vessels are constructed of carbon steel and coated with 35 a vinyl ester lining. 36 The shell thicknesses of the tanks identified in Table C.5 represent a nominal thickness of a new tank 37 when placed into operation. The tank capacities identified in this table represent the maximum volumes. 38 Nominal tank volumes discussed below represent the maximum volume in a tank unit during normal 39 operations. 40 C.4.1.1 Codes and Standards for Tank System Construction 41 Specific standards for the manufacture of tanks and process systems installed in the 200 Area ETF are 42 briefly discussed in the following sections. In addition to these codes and industrial standards, a seismic 43 analysis for each tank and process system is required [WAC 173-303-806(4)(a)(xi)]. The seismic 44 analysis was performed in accordance with UCRL-15910 Design and Evaluation Guidelines for 45 Department of Energy Facilities Subjected to Natural Phenomena Hazards, Section 4 (UCRL 1987). 46 The results of the seismic analyses are summarized in the engineering assessment of the 200 Area ETF 47 tank systems (Mausshardt 1995).

These tanks are maintained at or near 16 atmospheric pressure. The codes and standards applicable to the design, construction, and testing of the 17 above tanks and ancillary piping systems are as follows: 18 ASME -B31.3 Chemical Plant and Petroleum Refinery Piping (ASME 1990) 19 ASME Sect. VIII, Division I Pressure Vessels (ASME 1992a) 20 AWS -DI.1 Structural Welding Code -Steel (AWS 1992) 21 ANSI -B16.5 Pipe Flanges and Flanged Fittings (ANSI 1992) 22 ASME Sect. IX Welding and Brazing Qualifications (ASME 1992b) 23 API 620 Design and Construction of Large Welded Low Pressure Storage 24 Tanks (API 1990) 25 AWWA -DIO Welded Steel Tanks for Water Storage (AWWA 1989) 26 AWWA -D103 Factory-Coated Bolted Steel Tanks for Water Storage 27 (AWWA 1987) 28 AWWA -D120 Thermosetting Fiberglass-Reinforced Plastic Tanks 29 (AWWA 1984) 30 ASTM-D3299 Filament Wound Glass-Fiber-Reinforced Thermoset Resin 31 Corrosion Resistant Tanks. 32 The application of these standards to the construction of 200 Area ETF tanks and independent verification 33 of completed systems ensured that the tank and tank supports had sufficient structural strength and that 34 seams and connections were adequate to ensure tank integrity. In addition, each tank met strict quality 35 assurance requirements. Each tank constructed offsite was tested for integrity and leak tightness before 36 shipment to the Hanford Facility. Following installation, the systems were inspected for damage to 37 ensure against leakage and to verify proper operation. If a tank was damaged during shipment or 38 installation, leak tightness testing was repeated onsite. 39 C.4.1.2 Design Information for Tanks Located Outside of Effluent Treatment Facility 40 The load-in tanks, surge tank, and verification tanks are located outside the ETF. These tanks are located 41 within concrete structures that provide secondary containment. Addendum C.19

The 200 Area ETF evaporator, 2 the principal component of the evaporation process, is a cylindrical pressure vessel with a conical bottom. 3 Aqueous waste is fed into the lower portion of the vessel. The top of the vessel is domed and the vapor 4 outlet is configured to prevent carryover of liquid during the foaming or bumping (violent boiling) at the 5 liquid surface. The 200 Area ETF evaporator has a nominal operating capacity of approximately 6 18,500 liters. 7 The 200 Area ETF evaporator includes the following ancillary equipment: 8 * Preheater 9 * Recirculation pump 10 * Waste heater with steam level control tank 11 * Concentrate transfer pump 12 * Entrainment separator 13 * Vapor compressor with silencers 14 * Silencer drain pump 15 Distillate Flash Tank and Ancillary Equipment. The distillate flash tank is a horizontal tank that has a 16 nominal operating capacity of 780 liters. Ancillary equipment includes a pump to transfer the distillate to 17 the surge tank for reprocessing. 18 Concentrate Tanks and Ancillary Equipment. Each of the two concentrate tanks has an approximate 19 nominal capacity of 22,700 liters. Ancillary equipment includes overflow lines to a sump tank and pumps 20 for recirculation and transfer. 21 Sump Tanks. Sump tanks I and 2 are located below floor level. Both sump tanks are double-walled, 22 rectangular tanks, placed inside concrete vaults. Both tanks have a working volume of 4,000 liters each. 23 The sump tanks are located in pits below grade to allow gravity drain of solutions to the tanks. Each 24 sump tank has two vertical pumps for transfer of waste to the secondary waste receiving tanks or to the 25 surge tank for reprocessing. 26 C.4.1.4 Design Information for Effluent Treatment Facility Process Units 27 As with the 200 Area ETF tanks, process units that treat and/or store dangerous and/or mixed waste are 28 maintained at or near atmospheric pressure. These units were constructed to meet a series of design 29 standards, as discussed in the following sections. Table C.6 presents the materials of construction and the 30 ancillary equipment associated with these process units. All piping systems are designed to withstand the 31 effects of internal pressure, weight, thermal expansion and contraction, and any pulsating flow. The 32 design and integrity of these units are presented in the engineering assessment (Mausshardt 1995). 33 Filters. The load-in fine and rough filter vessels (including the influent and auxiliary filters) are designed 34 to comply with the ASME Section VIII, Division I, Pressure Vessels (ASME 1992a). The application of 35 these standards to the construction of the 200 Area ETF filter system and independent inspection ensure 36 that the filter and filter supports have sufficient structural strength and that the seams and connections are 37 adequate to ensure the integrity of the filter vessels. 38 Ultraviolet Oxidation System. The UV/OX reaction chamber is designed to comply with manufacturers 39 standards. 40 Degasification System. The codes and standards applicable to the design, fabrication, and testing of the 41 degasification column are identified as follows: 42 * ASME -B31.3, Chemical Plant and Petroleum Refinery Piping (ASME 1990) 43 * AWS -D1.1, Structural Welding Code -Steel (AWS 1992) 44 * ANSI -B16.5, Pipe Flanges and Flanged Fittings (ANSI 1992) Addendum C.21

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 Reverse Osmosis System. The pressure vessels in the RO unit are designed to comply with ASME 2 Section VIII, Division I, Pressure Vessels (ASME 1992a), and applicable codes and standards. 3 Ion Exchange (Polishers). The IX columns are designed in accordance with ASME Section VIII, 4 Division I, Pressure Vessels (ASME 1992a), and applicable codes and standards. Polisher piping is 5 fabricated of type 304 stainless steel or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and meets the requirements of 6 ASME B31.3, Chemical Plant and Petroleum Refinery Piping (ASME 1990). 7 Effluent Treatment Facility Evaporator. The 200 Area ETF evaporator is designed to meet the 8 requirements of ASME Section VIII, Division 1, Pressure Vessels (ASME 1992a), and applicable codes 9 and standards. The 200 Area ETF evaporator piping meets the requirements of ASME B31.3, Chemical 10 Plant and Petroleum Refinery Piping (ASME 1990). 11 Thin Film Dryer System. The thin film dryer is designed to meet the requirements of ASME 12 Section VIII, Division I, Pressure Vessels (ASME 1992a), and applicable codes and standards. The 13 piping meets the requirements of ASME -B31.3, Chemical Plant and Petroleum Refinery Piping 14 (ASME 1990). 15 C.4.1.5 Integrity Assessments 16 The integrity assessment for 200 Area ETF (Mausshardt 1995) attests to the adequacy of design and 17 integrity of the tanks and ancillary equipment to ensure that the tanks and ancillary equipment will not 18 collapse, rupture, or fail over the intended life considering intended uses. For the load-in tanks, a similar 19 integrity assessment was performed (KEH 1995 and HNF 2009a). Specifically, the assessment 20 documents the following considerations: 21 * Adequacy of the standards used during design and construction of the facility. 22 * Characteristics of the solution in each tank. 23 * Adequacy of the materials of construction to provide corrosion protection from the solution in 24 each tank. 25 * Results of the leak tests and visual inspections. 26 The results of these assessments demonstrate that tanks and ancillary equipment have sufficient structural 27 integrity and are acceptable for storing and treating dangerous and/or mixed waste. The assessments also 28 state that the tanks and building were designed and constructed to withstand a design-basis earthquake. 29 Independent, qualified registered professional engineers certified these tank assessments. 30 The scope of the 200 Area ETF tank integrity assessment was based on characterization data from process 31 condensate. To assess the effect that other aqueous waste might have on the integrity of the 200 Area 32 ETF tanks, the chemistry of an aqueous waste will be evaluated for its potential to corrode a tank 33 (e.g., chloride concentrations will be evaluated). The tank integrity assessment for the load-in tanks was 34 based on characterization data from several aqueous waste streams. The chemistry of an aqueous waste 35 stream not considered in the load-in tank integrity assessment also will be evaluated for the potential to 36 corrode a load-in tank. 37 Consistent with the recommendations of the integrity assessment, a corrosion inspection program was 38 developed. Periodic integrity assessments are scheduled for those tanks predicted to have the highest 39 potential for corrosion. These inspections are scheduled annually or longer, based on age of the tank 40 system, materials of construction, characteristics of the waste, operating experience, and 41 recommendations of the initial integrity assessment. These 'indicator tanks' include the concentrate 42 tanks, secondary waste receiving tanks, and verification tanks. One of each of these tanks will be 43 inspected yearly to determine if corrosion or coating failure has occurred. Should significant corrosion or 44 coating failure be found, an additional tank of the same type would be inspected during the same year. 45 Addendum C.22

--- Page 877 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I In the case of the verification tanks, if corrosion or coating failure is found in the second tank, the third 2 tank also will be inspected. If significant corrosion were observed in all three sets of tanks,'the balance of 3 the 200 Area ETF tanks would be considered for inspection. For tanks predicted to have lower potential 4 for corrosion, inspections also are performed nonroutinely as part of the corrective maintenance program. 5 C.4.2 Additional Requirements for New Tanks 6 Procedures for proper installation of tanks, tank supports, piping, concrete, etc., are included in 7 Construction Specification, Project C-018H, 242-A Evaporator/PUREX Plant Process Condensate 8 Treatment Facility (WHC 1992a). For the load-in tanks, procedures are included in the construction 9 specifications in Project W-291, 200 Area Effluent BAT/AKART Implementation ETF Truck Load-in 10 Facility (KEH 1994) and Purgewater Unloading Facility Project Documentation (HNF 2009b). 11 Following installation, an independent, qualified, registered professional engineer inspected the tanks and 12 secondary containment. Deficiencies identified included damage to the surge tank, damage to the 13 verification tank liners, and 200 Area ETF secondary containment concrete surface cracking. All 14 deficiencies were repaired to the satisfaction of the engineer. The tanks and ancillary equipment were 15 leak tested as part of acceptance of the system from the construction contractor. Information on the 16 inspections and leak tests are included in the engineering assessment (Mausshardt 1995). No deficiencies 17 were identified during installation of the load-in tanks and ancillary equipment. 18 C.4.3 Secondary Containment and Release Detection for Tank Systems 19 This section describes the design and operation of secondary containment and leak detection systems at 20 the ETF. 21 C.4.3.1 Secondary Containment Requirements for All Tank Systems 22 The specifications for the preparation, design, and construction of the secondary containment systems at 23 the 200 Area ETF are documented (WHC 1992a). The preparation, design, and construction of the 24 secondary containment for the load-in tanks are provided in the construction specifications (KEH 1994 25 and HNF 2009b). All systems were designed to national codes and standards. Constructing the 200 Area 26 ETF per these specifications ensured that foundations are capable of supporting tank and secondary 27 containment systems and that uneven settling and failures from pressure gradients should not occur. 28 C.4.3.1.1 Common Elements 29 The following text describes elements of secondary containment that are common to all 200 Area ETF 30 tank systems. Details on the secondary containment for specific tanks, including leak detection systems 31 and liquids removal, are provided in Section C.4.3.1,2. 32 Foundation and Construction. For the tanks within the ETF, except for the sump tanks, secondary 33 containment is provided by a coated concrete floor and a 15.2-centimeter rise (berm) along the containing 34 walls. The double-wall construction of the sump tanks provides secondary containment. Additionally, 35 trenches are provided in the floor that also provides containment and drainage of any liquid to a sump pit. 36 For tanks outside the ETF, secondary containment also is provided with coated concrete floors in a 37 containment pit (load-in tanks) or surrounded by concrete dikes (the surge and verification tanks). 38 The transfer piping that carries aqueous waste into the 200 Area ETF is pipe-within-a-pipe construction, 39 and is buried approximately 1.2 meters below ground surface. The pipes between the verification tanks 40 and the verification tank pumps within the 200 Area ETF are located in a concrete pipe trench. 41 For this discussion, there are five discrete secondary containment systems associated with the following 42 tanks and ancillary equipment that treat or store dangerous waste: 43 * Load-in tanks 44 * Surge tank 45 * Process area (including sump tanks) 46 * Verification tanks Addendum C.23

--- Page 878 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF * Transfer piping and pipe trenches 2 All of the secondary containment systems are designed with reinforcing steel and base and berm thickness 3 to minimize failure caused by pressure gradients, physical contact with the waste, and climatic conditions. 4 Classical theories of structural analysis, soil mechanics, and concrete and structural steel design were used 5 in the design calculations for the foundations and structures. These calculations are maintained at the 6 ETF. In each of the analyses, the major design criteria from the following documents were included: V-CO18HCI-001 Design Construction Specification, Project C-018H, 242A Evaporator/PUREX Plant Process Condensate Treatment Facility (WHC 1992a) DOE Order General Design Criteria 1A SDC-4.1 Standard Architectural-Civil Design Criteria, Design Loads for Facilities (DOE-RL 1988) UCRL-15910 Design and Evaluation Guidelines for Department of Energy Facilities Subjected to Natural Phenomena Hazards (UCRL 1987) UBC-91 Uniform Building Code, 1991 Edition (ICBO 1991) UBC-97 Uniform Building Code, 1997 Edition (ICC 1997, for Load-in tank 59A-TK-1) 7 The design and structural analysis calculations substantiate the structural designs in the referenced 8 drawings. The conclusions drawn from these calculations indicate that the designs are sound and that the 9 specified structural design criteria were met. This conclusion is verified in the independent design review 10 that was part of the engineering assessment (Mausshardt 1995, KEH 1994, and HNF 2009a). 11 Containment Materials. The concrete floor consists of cast-in-place and preformed concrete slabs. All 12 slab joints and floor and wall joints have water stops installed at the mid-depth of the slab. In addition, 13 filler was applied to each joint. 14 Except for the sump tank vaults, all of the concrete surfaces in the secondary containment system, 15 including berms, trenches, and pits, are coated with a chemical-resistant, high-solids, epoxy coating that 16 consists of a primer and a top coating. This coating material is compatible with the waste being treated, 17 and with the sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen peroxide additives to the process. The 18 coating protects the concrete from contact with any chemical materials that might be harmful to concrete 19 and prevents the concrete from being in contact with waste material. Table C.8 summarizes the specific 20 types of primer and top coats specified for the concrete and masonry surfaces in the ETF. The epoxy 21 coating is considered integral to the secondary containment system for the tanks and ancillary equipment. 22 The concrete containment systems are maintained such that any cracks, gaps, holes, and other 23 imperfections are repaired in a timely manner. Thus, the concrete containment systems do not allow 24 spilled liquid to reach soil or groundwater. There are a number of personnel doorways and vehicle access 25 points into the 200 Area ETF process areas. Releases of any spilled or leaked material to the environment 26 from these access points are prevented by 15.2-centimeter concrete curbs, sloped areas of the floor 27 (e.g., truck ramp), or trenches. 28 Containment Capacity and Maintenance. Each of these containment areas is designed to contain more 29 than 100 percent of the volume of the largest tank in each respective system. Secondary containment 30 systems for the surge tank, and the verification tanks, which are outside the ETF, also are large enough to 31 include the additional volume from a 25-year, 24-hour storm event; i.e., 5.3 centimeters of precipitation. 32 Sprinkler System. The sprinkler system within the 200 Area ETF supplies firewater protection to the 33 process area and the container storage area. This system is connected to a site wide water supply system 34 and has the capacity to supply sufficient water to suppress a fire at the ETF. However, in the event of 35 failure, the sprinkler system can be hooked up to another water source (e.g., tanker truck). Addendum C.24

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 C.4.3.1.2 Specific Containment Systems 2 The following discussion presents a description of the individual containment systems associated with 3 specific tank systems. 4 Load-In Tank Secondary Containment. The load-in tanks 59A-TK-109 and -117 are mounted on a 5 46-centimeter-thick reinforced concrete slab (Drawing H-2-817970). Secondary containment is provided 6 by a pit with 30.5-centimeter-thick walls and a floor constructed of reinforced concrete. The load-in tank 7 pit is sloped to drain solution to a sump. The depth of the pit varies with the slope of the floor, with an 8 average thickness of about 1.1 meters. The volume of the secondary containment is about 73,000 liters, 9 which is capable of containing the volume of at least one load-in tank (i.e., 34,200 liters). Leaks are 10 detected by a leak detector that alarms locally, in the 200 Area ETF control room, and by visual 11 inspection of the secondary containment. Alarms are monitored continuously in the ETF control room 12 during Load-in Station transfers and at least daily when there are no Load-in Station transfers occurring. 13 Adjacent to the pit is a 25.4-centimeter-thick reinforced concrete pad that serves as secondary 14 containment for the load-in tanker trucks, containers, transfer pumps, and filter system that serve as the 15 first tanker truck unloading bay. The pad is inside the metal Load-in building and is 15.2 centimeters 16 below grade with north and south walls gently sloped to allow truck access. The pad has a 3-inch drain 17 pipe to route waste solution to the adjacent load-in tank pit. The pad does not have protective coating 18 because it would experience excessive wear from the vehicle traffic. 19 Load-in tank 59A-TK-1 is located on a 25.4-centimeter-thick reinforced concrete slab 20 (Drawing H-2-817970) inside the metal Load-in building. The tank has a flat bottom which sits on a 21 concrete slab in the secondary containment. Secondary containment for the tank, filter system, and truck 22 unloading piping is provided by an epoxy coated catch basin with a capacity of about 3,400 liters. The 23 catch basin is sloped to route solution from the catch basin through a 15.2-centimeter-wide by 14.3- 24 centimeter-deep trench to the adjacent truck unloading pad. This pad drains to the Load-in tank pit 25 discussed above. The volume of the combined secondary containment of these two systems is greater 26 than 76,400 liters, which is capable of holding the volume of tank 59A-TK-1 (i.e., 26,000 liters). 27 Adjacent to tank 59A-TK-1 catch basin is a 25.4-centimeter-thick reinforced concrete pad that serves as 28 the second tanker truck unloading bay. The pad is inside the metal Load-in building and has a 2.4-meter 29 by 4.0-meter shallow, sloping pit to catch leaks during tanker truck unloading. The pit has a maximum 30 depth of 6.0 centimeters and a 15.2-centimeter-wide by 6.0-centimeter-deep trench to route leaks to the 31 adjacent tank 59A-TK-1 catch basin. The pad does not have protective coating because it would 32 experience excessive wear from the vehicle traffic. 33 Surge Tank Secondary Containment. The surge tank is mounted on a reinforced concrete ringwall. 34 Inside the ringwall, the flat-bottomed tank is supported by a bed of compacted sand and gravel with a 35 high-density polyethylene liner bonded to the ringwall. The liner prevents galvanic corrosion between the 36 soil and the tank. The secondary containment is reinforced concrete with a 15.2-centimeter thick floor 37 and a 20.3-centimeter thick dike. The secondary containment area shares part of the southern wall of the 38 main process area. The dike extends up 2.9 meters to provide a containment volume of 856,000 liters for 39 the 462,000-liter surge tank. 40 The floor of the secondary containment slopes to a sump in the northwest corner of the containment area. 41 Leaks into the secondary containment are detected by level instrumentation in the sump which alarms in 42 the ETF control room and/or by routine visual inspections. Sump alarms are monitored continuously in 43 the ETF control room during ETF processing operations and at least daily when ETF is not processing 44 waste. A sump pump is used to transfer solution in the secondary containment to a sump tank. 45 Process Area Secondary Containment. The process area contains the tanks and ancillary equipment of 46 the primary and secondary treatment trains, and has ajointed, reinforced concrete slab floor. The 47 concrete floor of the process area provides the secondary containment. This floor is a minimum of 48 15.2 centimeters thick. Addendum C.25

--- Page 880 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I With doorsills 15.2 centimeter high, the process area has a containment volume of approximately 93,800 2 liters. The largest tanks in the process area are the secondary waste receiving tanks, which each have a 3 maximum capacity of 73,800 liters. 4 The floor of the process area is sloped to drain liquids to two trenches that drain to a sump. Each trench is 5 approximately 38.1 centimeters wide with a sloped trough varying from 39.4 to 76.2 centimeters deep. 6 Leaks into the secondary containment are detected by routine visual inspections of the floor area near the 7 tanks, ancillary equipment, and in the trenches. 8 A small dam was placed in the trench that comes from the thin film dryer room to contain minor liquid 9 spills originating in the dryer room to minimize the spread of contamination into the process area. The 10 dryer room is inspected for leaks in accordance with the inspection schedule in Addendum I. Operators 11 clean up these minor spills by removing the liquid waste and decontaminating the spill area. 12 A small dam was also placed in the trench adjacent to the chemical feed skid when the chemical berm 13 area was expanded to accommodate acid and caustic pumps, which were moved indoors from the top of 14 the surge tank to resolve a safety concern. This dam was designed to contain minor spills originating in 15 the chemical berm area and prevent them from entering the process sump. 16 The northwest corner of the process area consists of a pump pit containing the pumps and piping for 17 transferring treated effluent from the verification tanks to SALDS. The pit is built 1.37 meters below the 18 process area floor level and is sloped to drain to a trench built along its north wall that routes liquid to 19 sump tank 1. Leaks into the secondary containment of the pump pit are detected by routine visual 20 inspections. 21 Sump Tanks. The sump tanks support the secondary containment system, and collect waste from several 22 sources, including: 23 * Process area drain trenches. 24 * Tank overflows and drains. 25 * Container washing water. 26 * Resin dewatering solution. 27 * Steam boiler blow down. 28 * Sampler system drains. 29 These double-contained tanks are located within unlined, concrete vaults. The sump tank levels are 30 monitored by remote level indicators or through visual inspections from the sump covers. These 31 indicators are connected to high- and low-level alarms that are monitored in the ETF control room during 32 ETF processing operations and at least daily when ETF is not processing liquid waste. When a high- 33 level alarm is activated, a pump is activated and the sump tank contents usually are routed to the 34 secondary treatment train for processing. The contents also could be routed to the surge tank for 35 treatment in the primary treatment train. In the event of an abnormally high inflow rate, a second sump 36 pump is initiated automatically. 37 Verification Tank Secondary Containment. The three verification tanks are each mounted on 38 ringwalls with high-density polyethylene liners similar to the surge tank. The secondary containment for 39 the three tanks is reinforced concrete with a 15.2-centimeter thick floor and a 20.3-centimeter thick dike. 40 The dike extends up 2.6 meters to provide a containment of approximately 3,390,000 liters exceeding the 41 capacity of a single verification tank (See Table C.5). 42 The floor of the secondary containment slopes to a sump along the southern wall of the dike. Leaks into 43 the secondary containment are detected by level instrumentation in the sump and/or by routine visual 44 inspections. Sump alarms are monitored continuously in the ETF control room during ETF processing 45 operations and at least daily when ETF is not processing waste. A sump pump is used to transfer solution 46 in the secondary containment to a sump tank. Addendum C.26

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I C.4.3.2 Additional Requirements for Specific Types of Systems 2 This section addresses additional requirements in WAC 173-303-640 for double-walled tanks like the 3 sump tanks and secondary containment for ancillary equipment and piping associated with the tank 4 systems. 5 C.4.3.2.1 Double-Walled Tanks 6 The sump tanks are the only tanks in the 200 Area ETF classified as 'double-walled' tanks. These tanks 7 are located in unlined concrete vaults and support the secondary containment system for the process area. 8 The sump tanks are equipped with a leak detector between the walls of the tanks that provide continuous 9 monitoring for leaks. The leak detector alarms are monitored in the ETF control room. These sump tank 10 alarms are monitored continuously during ETF processing operations and at least daily when ETF is not 11 processing waste. The inner tanks are contained completely within the outer shells. The tanks are 12 contained completely within the concrete structure of the 200 Area ETF so corrosion protection from 13 external galvanic corrosion is not necessary. 14 C.4.3.2.2 Ancillary Equipment 15 The secondary containment provided for the tanks and process systems also serves as secondary 16 containment for the ancillary equipment associated with these systems. 17 Ancillary Equipment. Section C.4.3.1.2 describes the secondary containment systems that also serve 18 most of the ancillary equipment within the 200 Area ETF. Between the 200 Area ETF and the 19 verification tanks, a pipeline trench provides secondary containment for four pipelines connecting the 20 transfer pumps (i.e., discharge and return pumps) in the 200 Area ETF with the verification tanks 21 (Figure C.2). This concrete trench crosses under the road and extends from the verification tank pumps to 22 the verification tanks. Treated effluent flows through these pipelines from the verification tank pumps to 23 the verification tanks. The return pump is used to return effluent to the 200 Area ETF for use as service 24 water or for reprocessing. 25 For all of the ancillary equipment housed within the ETF, the concrete floor, trenches, and berms form the 26 secondary containment system. For the ancillary equipment of the surge tank and the verification tanks, 27 secondary containment is provided by the concrete floors and dikes associated with these tanks. The 28 concrete floor and pit provide secondary containment for the ancillary equipment of the load-in tanks. 29 Transfer Piping and Pipe Trenches. The two buried transfer lines between LERF and the surge tank 30 have secondary containment in a pipe-within-a-pipe arrangement. The 4-inch transfer line has an 8-inch 31 outer pipe, while the 3-inch transfer, line has a 6-inch outer pipe. The pipes are fiberglass and are sloped 32 towards the surge tank. The outer piping ends with a drain valve in the surge tank secondary 33 containment. 34 These pipelines are equipped with leak detection located in the annulus between the inner and outer pipes; 35 the leak detection equipment can continuously 'inspect' the pipelines during aqueous waste transfers. The 36 alarms on the leak detection system are monitored in the ETF control room. The control room alarms are 37 monitored continuously during aqueous waste transfers between LERF and the ETF surge tank and at 38 least daily when no transfers are occurring. A low-volume air purge of the annulus is provided to prevent 39 condensation buildup and minimize false alarms by the leak detection system. In the event that these leak 40 detectors are not in service, the pipelines are inspected during transfers by opening a drain valve to check 41 for solution in the annular space between the inner and outer pipe. 42 The 3-inch transfer line between the load-in tanks and the surge tank has a 6-inch outer pipe in a pipe- 43 within-a-pipe arrangement. The piping is made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic and slopes towards the 44 load-in tank secondary containment pit. The drain valve and leak detection system for the load-in tank 45 pipelines are operated similarly to the leak detection system for the LERF to 200 Area ETF pipelines. 46 As previously indicated, a reinforced concrete pipe trench provides secondary containment for piping 47 under the roadway between the 200 Area ETF and the verification tanks. Addendum C.27

--- Page 882 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I Three 15.2 centimeter thick reinforced concrete partitions divide the trench into four portions and support 2 metal gratings over the trench. Each portion of the trench is 1.2 meters wide, 0.76 meter deep, and slopes 3 to route any solution present to 4-inch drain lines through the north wall of the ETF building. These drain 4 lines route solution to sump tank 2 in ETF. The floor of the pipe trench is 30.5 centimeters thick and the 5 sides are 15.2 centimeters thick. The concrete trenches are coated with water sealant and covered with 6 metal gratings at ground level to allow vehicle traffic on the roadway. 7 C.4.4 Tank Management Practices 8 When an aqueous waste stream is identified for treatment or storage at 200 Area ETF, the generating unit 9 is required to characterize the waste. Based on characterization data, the waste stream is evaluated to 10 determine if the stream is acceptable for treatment or storage. Specific tank management practices are 11 discussed in the following sections. 12 C.4.4.1.1 Rupture, Leakage, Corrosion Prevention 13 Most aqueous waste streams can be managed such that corrosion would not be a concern. For example, 14 an aqueous waste stream with high concentrations of chloride might cause corrosion problems when 15 concentrated in the secondary treatment train. One approach is to adjust the corrosion control measures in 16 the secondary treatment train. An alternative might be to blend this aqueous waste in a LERF basin with 17 another aqueous waste that has sufficient dissolved solids, such that the concentration of the chlorides in 18 the secondary treatment train would not pose a corrosion concern. 19 Additionally, the materials of construction used in the tanks systems (Table C.5) make it unlikely that an 20 aqueous waste would corrode a tank. For more information on corrosion prevention, refer to 21 Addendum B, Waste Analysis Plan. 22 If operating experience suggests that most aqueous waste streams can be managed such that corrosion 23 would not be a concern, operating practices and integrity assessment schedules and requirements will be 24 reviewed and modified as appropriate. 25 When a leak in a tank system is discovered, the leak is immediately contained or stopped by isolating the 26 leaking component. Following containment, the requirements of WAC 173-303-640(7), incorporated by 27 reference, are followed. These requirements include repair or closure of the tank/tank system component, 28 and certification of any major repairs. 29 C.4.4.2 Overfilling Prevention 30 Operating practices and administrative controls used at the 200 Area ETF to prevent overfilling a tank are 31 discussed in the following paragraphs. The 200 Area ETF process is controlled by the MCS. The MCS 32 monitors liquid levels in the 200 Area ETF tanks and has alarms that annunciate on high-liquid level to 33 notify operators that actions must be taken to prevent overfilling of these vessels. As an additional 34 precaution to prevent spills, many tanks are equipped with overflow lines that route solutions to sump 35 tanks I and 2. These tanks include the pH adjustment tank; RO feed tanks, effluent pH adjustment tank, 36 secondary waste receiving tanks, and concentrate tanks. 37 The following section discusses feed systems, safety cutoff devices, bypass systems, and pressure 38 controls for specific tanks and process systems. 39 Tanks. All tanks are equipped with liquid level sensors that give a reading of the tank liquid volume. All 40 of the tanks are equipped further with liquid level alarms that are actuated if the liquid volume is near the 41 tank overflow capacity. In the actuation of the surge tank alarm, a liquid level switch trips, sending a 42 signal to the valve actuator on the tank influent lines, and causing the influent valves to close. 43 The operating mode for each verification tank, i.e., receiving, holding, or discharging, can be designated 44 through the MCS; modes also switch automatically. When the high-level set point on the receiving 45 verification tank is reached, the flow to this tank is diverted and another tank becomes the receiver. The 46 full tank is switched into verification mode. The third tank is reserved for discharge mode. Addendum C.28

--- Page 883 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 The liquid levels in the pH adjustment, first and second RO feed, and effluent pH adjustment tanks are 2 maintained within predetermined operating ranges. Should any of these tanks overflow, the excess waste 3 is piped along with any leakage from the feed pumps to a sump tank. 4 When waste in a secondary waste-receiving tank reaches the high-level set point, the influent flow of 5 waste is redirected to the second tank. In a similar fashion, the concentrate tanks switch receipt modes 6 when the high-level set point of one tank is reached. 7 Filter Systems. All filters at 200 Area ETF (i.e., the Load-In Station, rough, fine, and auxiliary filter 8 systems) are in leak-tight steel casings. For the rough and fine filters, a high differential pressure, which 9 could damage the filter element, activates a valve that shuts off liquid flow to protect the filter element 10 from possible damage. To prevent a high-pressure situation, the filters are cleaned routinely with pulses 11 of compressed air that force water back through the filter. Cleaning is terminated automatically by 12 shutting off the compressed air supply if high pressure develops. The differential pressure across the 13 auxiliary filters also is monitored. A high differential pressure in these filters would result in a system 14 shutdown to allow the filters to be changed out. 15 The Load-In Station filtration system has pressure gauges for monitoring the differential pressure across 16 each filter. A high differential pressure would result in discontinuing filter operation until the filter is 17 replaced. 18 Ultraviolet Light/Oxidation System and Decomposers. A rupture disk on the inlet piping to each of 19 the UV/OX reaction vessels relieves to the pH adjustment tank in the event of excessive pressure 20 developing in the piping system. Should the rupture disk fail, the aqueous waste would trip the moisture 21 sensor, shut down the UV lamps, and close the surge tank feed valve. Also provided is a level sensor to 22 protect UV lamps against the risk of exposure to air. Should those sensors be actuated, the UV lamps 23 would be shut down immediately. 24 The piping and valving for the hydrogen peroxide decomposers are configured to split the waste flow: 25 half flows to one decomposer and half flows to the other decomposer. Alternatively, the total flow of 26 waste can be treated in one decomposer or both decomposers can be bypassed. A safety relief valve on 27 each decomposer vessel can relieve excess system pressure to a sump tank. 28 Degasification System. The degasification column is typically supplied aqueous waste feed by the pH 29 adjustment tank feed pump. This pump transfers waste solution through the hydrogen peroxide 30 decomposer, the fine filter, and the degasification column to the first RO feed tank. 31 The degasification column is designed for operation at a partial vacuum. A pressure sensor in the outlet 32 of the column detects the column pressure. The vacuum in the degasification column is maintained by a 33 blower connected to the vessel off gas system. The column is protected from extremely low pressure 34 developed by the column blower by the use of an intake vent that is maintained in the open position 35 during operation. The column liquid level is regulated by a flow control system with a high- and low- 36 level alarm. Plate-type heat exchanger cools the waste solution fed to the degasification column. 37 Reverse Osmosis System. The flow through the first and second RO stages is controlled to maintain 38 constant liquid levels in the first and second stage RO feed tanks. 39 Polisher. Typically, two of the three columns are in operation (lead/lag) and the third (regenerated) 40 column is in standby. When the capacity of the resin in the first column is exceeded, as detected by an 41 increase in the conductivity of the column effluent, the third column, containing freshly regenerated IX 42 resin, is brought online. The first column is taken offline, and the waste is rerouted to the second column, 43 and to the third. Liquid level instrumentation and automatically operated valves are provided in the IX 44 system to prevent overfilling. 45 Effluent Treatment Facility Evaporator. Liquid level instrumentation in the secondary waste receiving 46 tanks is designed to preclude a tank overflow. A liquid level switch actuated by a high-tank liquid level 47 causes the valves to reposition, closing off flow to the secondary waste receiving tanks. Secondary 48 containment for these tanks routes liquids to a sump tank. Addendum C.29

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 Valves in the 200 Area ETF evaporator feed line can be positioned to bypass the secondary waste around 2 the 200 Area ETF evaporator and to transfer the secondary waste to the concentrate tanks. 3 Thin Film Dryer. The two concentrate tanks alternately feed the thin film dryer. Typically, one tank 4 serves as a concentrate waste receiver while the other tank serves as the dryer feed tank. One tank may 5 serve as both concentrate waste receiver and dryer feed tank. Liquid level instrumentation prevents tank 6 overflow by diverting the concentrate flow from the full concentrate tank to the other concentrate tank. 7 Secondary containment for these tanks routes liquids to a sump tank. 8 An alternate route is provided from the concentrate receiver tank to the secondary waste receiving tanks. 9 Dilute concentrate in the concentrate receiver tank can be reprocessed through the 200 Area ETF 10 evaporator by transferring the concentrate back to a secondary waste-receiving tank. 11 C.4.5 Labels or Signs 12 Each tank or process unit in the 200 Area ETF is identified by a nameplate attached in a readily visible 13 location. Included on the nameplate are the equipment number and the equipment title. Those tanks that 14 store or treat dangerous waste at the 200 Area ETF (Section C.4. 1.1) are identified with a label, which 15 reads PROCESS WATER/WASTE. The labels are legible at a distance of at least fifty feet or as 16 appropriate for legibility within the ETF. Additionally, these tanks bear a legend that identifies the waste 17 in a manner, which adequately warns employees, emergency personnel, and the public of the major risk(s) 18 associated with the waste being stored or treated in the tank system(s). 19 Caution plates are used to show possible hazards and warn that precautions are necessary. Caution signs 20 have a yellow background and black panel with yellow letters and bear the word CA UTION. Danger 21 signs show immediate danger and signify that special precautions are necessary. These signs are red, 22 black, and white and bear the word DANGER. 23 Tanks and vessels containing corrosive chemicals are posted with black and white signs bearing the word 24 CORROSIVE. DANGER -UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL KEEP OUT signs are posted on all exterior 25 doors of the ETF, and on each interior door leading into the process area. Tank ancillary piping is also 26 labeled PROCESS WATER or PROCESS LIQUID to alert personnel which pipes in the process area 27 contains dangerous and/or mixed waste. 28 All tank systems holding dangerous waste are marked with labels or signs to identify the waste contained 29 in the tanks. The labels or signs are legible at a distance of at least 50-feet and bear a legend that 30 identifies the waste in a manner that adequately warns employees, emergency response personnel, and the 31 public, of the major risk(s) associated with the waste being stored or treated in the tank system(s). 32 C.4.6 Air Emissions 33 Tank systems that contain extremely hazardous waste that is acutely toxic by inhalation must be designed 34 to prevent the escape of such vapors. To date, no extremely hazardous waste has been managed in 35 200 Area ETF tanks and is not anticipated. However, the 200 Area ETF tanks have forced ventilation that 36 draws air from the tank vapor spaces to prevent exposure of operating personnel to any toxic vapors that 37 might be present. The vapor passes through a charcoal filter and two sets of high-efficiency particulate 38 air filters before discharge to the environment. The Load-in tanks and verification tanks are vented to the 39 atmosphere. 40 C.4.7 Management of Ignitable or Reactive Wastes in Tanks Systems 41 Although the 200 Area ETF is permitted to accept waste that is designated ignitable or reactive, such 42 waste would be treated or blended immediately after placement in the tank system so that the resulting 43 waste mixture is no longer ignitable or reactive. Aqueous waste received does not meet the definition of a 44 combustible or flammable liquid given in National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) code number 45 30 (NFPA 1996). 46 Addendum C.30

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I The buffer zone requirements in NFPA-30, which require tanks containing combustible or flammable 2 solutions be a safe distance from each other and from public way, are not applicable. 3 C.4.8 Management of Incompatible Wastes in Tanks Systems 4 The 200 Area ETF manages dilute solutions that can be mixed without compatibility issues. The 5 200 Area ETF is equipped with several systems that can adjust the pH of the waste for treatment 6 activities. Sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide are added to the process through the MCS for pH 7 adjustment to ensure there will be no large pH fluctuations and adverse reactions in the tank systems. 8 C.5 Surface Impoundments 9 This section provides specific information on surface impoundment operations at the LERF, including 10 descriptions of the liners and secondary containment structures, as required by WAC 173-303-650 and 11 WAC 173-303-806(4)(d). 12 The LERF consists of three lined surface impoundments (basins) with a design operating capacity of 13 29.5 million liters each. The maximum capacity of each basin is 34 million liters. The dimensions of 14 each basin at the anchor wall are approximately 103 meters by 85 meters. The typical top dimensions of 15 the wetted area are approximately 89 meters by 71 meters, while the bottom dimensions are 16 approximately 57 by 38 meters. Total depth from the top of the dike to the bottom of the basin is 17 approximately 7 meters. The typical finished basin bottoms lie at about 4 meters below the initial grade 18 and 175 meters above sea level. The dikes separating the basins have a typical height of 3 meters and 19 typical top width of 11.6 meters around the perimeter of the impoundments. 20 C.5.1 List of Dangerous Waste 21 A list of dangerous and/or mixed aqueous waste that can be stored in LERF is presented in Addendum A. 22 Addendum B, Waste Analysis Plan also provides a discussion of the types of waste that are managed in 23 the LERF. 24 C.5.2 Construction, Operation, and Maintenance of Liner System 25 General information concerning the liner system is presented in the following sections. Information 26 regarding loads on the liner, liner coverage, UV light exposure prevention, and location relative to the 27 water table are discussed. 28 C.5.2.1 Liner Construction Materials 29 The LERF employs a double-composite liner system with a leachate detection, collection, and removal 30 system between the primary and secondary liners. Each basin is constructed with an upper or primary 31 liner consisting of a high-density polyethylene geomembrane laid over a bentonite carpet liner. The lower 32 or secondary liner in each basin is a composite of a geomembrane laid over a layer of soil/bentonite 33 admixture with a hydraulic conductivity less than 10' centimeters per second. The synthetic liners extend 34 up the dike wall to a concrete anchor wall that surrounds the basin at the top of the dike. A batten system 35 bolts the layers in place to the anchor wall (Figure C.16). 36 Figure C.17 is a schematic cross-section of the liner system. The liner components, listed from the top to 37 the bottom of the liner system, are the following: 38 * Primary 1.5-millimeter high-density polyethylene geomembrane 39 * Bentonite carpet liner 40 * Geotextile 41 * Drainage gravel (bottom) and geonet (sides) 42 * Geotextile 43 * Secondary 1.5-millimeter high-density polyethylene geomembrane 44 * Soil/bentonite admixture (91 centimeters on the bottom, 107 centimeters on the sides) Addendum C.31

--- Page 886 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF * Geotextile 2 The primary geomembrane, made of 1.5-millimeter high-density polyethylene, forms the basin surface 3 that holds the aqueous waste. The secondary geomembrane, also 1.5-millimeter high-density 4 polyethylene, forms a barrier surface for leachate that might penetrate the primary liner. The high-density 5 polyethylene chemically is resistant to constituents in the aqueous waste and has a relatively high strength 6 compared to other lining materials. The high-density polyethylene resin specified for the LERF contains 7 carbon black, antioxidants, and heat stabilizers to enhance its resistance to the degrading effects of UV 8 light. The approach to ensuring the compatibility of aqueous waste streams with the LERF liner materials 9 and piping is discussed in Addendum B, Waste Analysis Plan. 10 Three geotextile layers are used in the LERF liner system. The layers are thin, nonwoven polypropylene 11 fabric that chemically is resistant, highly permeable, and resistant to microbiological growth. The first 12 two layers prevent fine soil particles from infiltrating and clogging the drainage layer. The second 13 geotextile also provides limited protection for the secondary geomembrane from the drainage rock. The 14 third geotextile layer prevents the mixing of the soil/bentonite admixture with the much more porous and 15 granular foundation material. 16 A 30.5-centimeters-thick gravel drainage layer on the bottom of the basins between the primary and 17 secondary liners provides a flow path for liquid to the leachate detection, collection, and removal system. 18 A geonet (or drainage net) is located immediately above the secondary geomembrane on the basin 19 sidewalls. The geonet functions as a preferential flow path for liquid between the liners, carrying liquid 20 down to the gravel drainage layer and subsequently to the leachate sump. The geonet is a mesh made of 21 high-density polyethylene, with approximately 13-millimeter openings. 22 The soil/bentonite layer is 91 centimeters thick on the bottom of the basins and 107 centimeters thick on 23 the basin sidewalls; its permeability is less than 10-7 centimeters per second. This composite liner design, 24 consisting of a geomembrane laid over essentially impermeable soil/bentonite, is considered best 25 available technology for solid waste landfills and surface impoundments. The combination of synthetic 26 and clay liners is reported in the literature to provide the maximum protection from waste migration 27 (Forseth and Kmet 1983). 28 A number of laboratory tests were conducted to measure the engineering properties of the soil/bentonite 29 admixture, in addition to extensive field tests performed on three test fills constructed near the LERF site. 30 For establishing an optimum ratio of bentonite to soil for the soil/bentonite admixture, mixtures of various 31 ratios were tested to determine permeability and shear strength. A mixture of 12 percent bentonite was 32 selected for the soil/bentonite liner and tests described in the following paragraphs demonstrated that the 33 admixture meets the desired permeability of less than 10-7 centimeters per second. Detailed discussion of 34 test procedures and results is provided in Report of Geotechnical Investigation, 242-A Evaporation and 35 PUREX Interim Storage Basins (Chen-Northem 1990). 36 Direct shear tests were performed according to ASTM D3080 test procedures (ASTM 1990) on 37 soil/bentonite samples of various ratios. Based on these results, the conservative minimum Mohr- 38 Coulomb shear strength value of 30 degrees was estimated for a soil/bentonite admixture containing 39 12 percent bentonite. 40 The high degree of compaction of the soil/bentonite layer [92 percent per ASTM Dl 557 (ASTM 1991)] 41 was expected to maximize the bonding forces between the clay particles, thereby minimizing moisture 42 transport through the liner. With respect to particle movement ('piping'), estimated fluid velocities in this 43 low-permeability material are too low to move the soil particles. Therefore, piping is not considered a 44 problem. 45 For the soil/bentonite layer, three test fills were constructed to demonstrate that materials, methods, and 46 procedures used would produce a soil/bentonite liner that meets the EPA permeability requirement of less 47 than 10' centimeters per second. All test fills met the EPA requirements. 48 Addendum C.32

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 A thorough discussion of construction procedures, testing, and results is provided in Report of 2 Permeability Testing, Soil-bentonite Test Fill (Chen-Northern 1991 a). 3 The aqueous waste stored in the LERF is typically a dilute mixture of organic and inorganic constituents. 4 Though isolated instances of soil liner incompatibility have been documented in the literature (Forseth 5 and Kmet 1983), these instances have occurred with concentrated solutions that were incompatible with 6 the geomembrane liners in which the solutions were contained. Considering the dilute nature of the 7 aqueous waste that is and will be stored in LERF and the moderate pH, and test results demonstrating the 8 compatibility of the high-density polyethylene liners with the aqueous waste [9090 Test Results 9 (WHC 1991)], gross failure of the soil/bentonite layer is not probable. 10 Each basin also is equipped with a floating very low-density polyethylene cover. The cover is anchored 11 and tensioned at the concrete wall at the top of the dikes, using a patented mechanical tensioning system. 12 Figure C.16 depict the tension mechanism and the anchor wall at the perimeter of each basin. Additional 13 information on the cover system is provided in Section C.5.2.5. 14 C.5.2.1.1 Material Specifications 15 Material specifications for the liner system and leachate collection system, including liners, drainage 16 gravel, and drainage net are discussed in the following sections. Material specifications are documented 17 in the Final Specifications 242-A Evaporator and PUREX Interim Retention Basins (KEH 1990a) and 18 Construction Specifications for 242-A Evaporator and PUREXInterim Retention Basins (KEH 1990b). 19 Geomembrane Liners. The high-density polyethylene resin for geomembranes for the LERF meets the 20 material specifications listed in Table C.9. Key physical properties include thickness (1.5 millimeters 21 [60 mil]) and impermeability (hydrostatic resistance of over 360,000 kilogram per square meter). 22 Physical properties meet National Sanitation Foundation Standard 54 (NSF 1985). Testing to determine 23 if the liner material is compatible with typical dilute waste solutions was performed and documented in 24 9090 Test Results (WHC 1991). 25 Soil/Bentonite Liner. The soil/bentonite admixture consists of 11.5 to 14.5 percent bentonite mixed into 26 well-graded silty sand with a maximum particle size of 4.75 millimeters (No. 4 sieve). Test fills were 27 performed to confirm the soil/bentonite admixture applied at LERF has hydraulic conductivity less than 28 10' centimeters per second, as required by WAC 173-303-650(2)() for new surface impoundments. 29 Bentonite Carpet Liner. The bentonite carpet liner consists of bentonite (90 percent sodium 30 montmorillonite clay) in a primary backing of woven polypropylene with nylon filler fiber, and a cover 31 fabric of open weave spunlace polyester. The montmorillonite is anticipated to retard migration of 32 solution through the liner, exhibiting a favorable cation exchange for adsorption of some constituents 33 (such as ammonium). Based on composition of the bentonite carpet and of the type of aqueous waste 34 stored at LERF, no chemical attack, dissolution, or degradation of the bentonite carpet liner is anticipated. 35 Geotextile. The nonwoven geotextile layers consist of long-chain polypropylene polymers containing 36 stabilizers and inhibitors to make the filaments resistant to deterioration from UV light and heat exposure. 37 The geotextile layers consist of continuous geotextile sheets held together by needle punching. Edges of 38 the fabric are sealed or otherwise finished to prevent outer material from pulling away from the fabric or 39 raveling. 40 Drainage Gravel. The drainage layer consists of thoroughly washed and screened, naturally occurring 41 rock meeting the size specifications for Grading Number 5 in Washington State Department of 42 Transportation construction specifications (WSDOT 1988). The specifications for the drainage layer are 43 given in Table C.10. Hydraulic conductivity tests (Chen-Northern 1992a, 1992b, 1992c) showed the 44 drainage rock used at LERF met the sieve requirements and had a hydraulic conductivity of at least 45 1 centimeter per second, which exceeded the minimum of at least 0.1 centimeters per second required by 46 WAC 173-303-650(2)(j) for new surface impoundments. 47 Addendum C.33

--- Page 888 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I Geonet. The geonet is fabricated from two sets of parallel high-density polyethylene strands, spaced 2 1.3 centimeters center-to-center maximum to form a mesh with minimum two strands per 2.54 centimeter 3 in each direction. The geonet is located between the liners on the sloping sidewalls to provide a 4 preferential flow path for leachate to the drainage gravel and subsequently to the leachate sump. 5 Leachate Collection Sump. Materials used to line the 3.0-meter by 1.8-meter by 0.30-meter-deep 6 leachate sump, at the bottom of each basin in the northwest corner, include [from top to bottom 7 (Figure C.18)]: 8 * 25 millimeter high-density polyethylene flat stock (supporting the leachate riser pipe) 9 * Geotextile 10 * 1.5-millimeter high-density polyethylene rub sheet 11 * Secondary composite liner: 12 o 1.5-millimeter high-density polyethylene geomembrane 13 o 91 centimeters of soil/bentonite admixture 14 o Geotextile 15 Specifications for these materials are identical to those discussed previously. 16 Leachate System Risers. Risers for the leachate system consist of 10-inch and 4-inch pipes from the 17 leachate collection sump to the catch basin northwest of each basin (Figure C. 18). The risers lay below 18 the primary liner in a gravel-filled trench that also extends from the sump to the concrete catch basin. 19 The risers are high-density polyethylene pipes fabricated to meet the requirements in ASTM D1248 20 (ASTM 1989). The 10-inch riser is perforated every 20.3 centimeters with 1.3-centimeter holes around 21 the diameter. Level sensors and leachate pump are inserted in the 10-inch riser to monitor and remove 22 leachate from the sump. To prevent clogging of the pump and piping with fine particulate, the end of the 23 riser is encased in a gravel-filled box constructed of high-density polyethylene geonet and wrapped in 24 geotextile. The 4-inch riser is perforated every 10.2 centimeters with 0.64-centimeter holes around the 25 diameter. A level detector is inserted in the 4-inch riser. 26 Leachate Pump. A deep-well submersible pump, designed to deliver approximately 110 liters per 27 minute, is installed in the 10-inch leachate riser in each basin. Wetted parts of the leachate pump are 28 made of 316L stainless steel, providing both corrosion resistance and durability. 29 C.S.2.1.2 Loads on Liner System 30 The LERF liner system is subjected to the following types of stresses. 31 Stresses from Installation or Construction Operations. Contractors were required to submit 32 construction quality control plans that included procedures, techniques, tools, and equipment used for the 33 construction and care of liner and leachate system. Methods for installation of all components were 34 screened to ensure that the stresses on the liner system were kept to a minimum. 35 Calculations were performed to estimate the risk of damage to the secondary high-density polyethylene 36 liner during construction (Calculations for LERF Part B Permit Application [HNF 1997]). The greatest 37 risk expected was from spreading the gravel layer over the geotextile layer and secondary geomembrane. 38 The results of the calculations show that the strength of the geotextile was sufficiently high to withstand 39 the stress of a small gravel spreader driving on a minimum of 15 centimeters of gravel over the geotextile 40 and geomembrane. The likelihood of damage to the geomembrane lying under the geotextile was 41 considered low. 42 To avoid driving heavy machinery directly on the secondary liner, a 28-meter conveyer was used to 43 deliver the drainage gravel into the basins. The gravel was spread and consolidated by hand tools and a 44 bulldozer. The bulldozer traveled on a minimum thickness of 30.5 centimeters of gravel. Addendum C.34

--- Page 889 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I Where the conveyer assembly was placed on top of the liner, cribbing was placed to distribute the 2 conveyer weight. No heavy equipment was allowed for use directly in contact with the geomembranes. 3 Additional calculations were performed to estimate the ability of the leachate riser pipe to withstand the 4 static and dynamic loading imposed by lightweight construction equipment riding on the gravel layer 5 (HNF 1997). Those calculations demonstrated that the pipe could buckle under the dynamic loading of 6 small construction equipment; therefore, the pipe was avoided by equipment during spreading of the 7 drainage gravel. 8 Installation of synthetic lining materials proceeded only when winds were less than 24 kilometers per 9 hour, and not during precipitation. The minimum ambient air temperature for unfolding or unrolling the 10 high-density polyethylene sheets was -10 C, and a minimum temperature of 0 C was required for seaming 11 the high-density polyethylene sheets. Between shifts, geomembranes and geotextile were anchored with 12 sandbags to prevent lifting by wind. Calculations were performed to determine the appropriate spacing of 13 sandbags on the geomembrane to resist lifting caused by 130 kilometer per hour winds (HNF 1997). All 14 of the synthetic components contain UV light inhibitors and no impairment of performance is anticipated 15 from the short-term UV light exposure during construction. Section C.5.2.4 provides further detail on 16 exposure prevention. 17 During the laying of the soil/bentonite layer and the overlying geomembrane, moisture content of the 18 admixture was monitored and adjusted to ensure optimum compaction and to avoid development of 19 cracks. 20 C.5.2.1.3 Static and Dynamic Loads and Stresses from the Maximum Quantity of Waste 21 When a LERF basin is full, liquid depth is approximately 6.4 meters. Static load on the primary liner is 22 roughly 6,400 kilograms per square meter. Load on the secondary liner is slightly higher because of the 23 weight of the gravel drainage layer. Assuming a density of 805 kilograms per square meter for the 24 drainage gravel [conservative estimate based on specific gravity of 2.65 (Ambrose 1988)], the secondary 25 high-density polyethylene liner carries approximately 7,200 kilograms per square meter when a basin is 26 full. 27 Side slope liner stresses were calculated for each of the layers in the basin sidewalls and for the pipe 28 trench on the northwest corner of each basin (HNF 1997). Results of these calculations indicate factors of 29 safety against shear were 1.5 or greater for the primary geomembrane, geotextile, geonet, and secondary 30 geomembrane. 31 Because the LERF is not located in an area of seismic concern, as identified in Appendix VI of 32 40 CFR 264 and WAC 173-303-282(6)(a)(I), discussion and calculation of potential seismic events are 33 not required. 34 C.5.2.1.4 Stresses Resulting from Settlement, Subsidence, or Uplift 35 Uplift stresses from natural sources are expected to have negligible impact on the liner. Groundwater lies 36 approximately 62 meters below the LERF, average annual precipitation is only 16 centimeters, and the 37 average unsaturated permeability of the soils near the basin bottoms is high, ranging from about 38 5.5 x 104 centimeters per second to about I centimeter per second (Chen-Northern 199 1b). Therefore, no 39 hydrostatic uplift forces are expected to develop in the soil underneath the basins. In addition, the soil 40 under the basins consists primarily of gravel and sand, and contains few or no organic constituents. 41 Therefore, uplift caused by gas production from organic degradation is not anticipated. 42 Based on the design of the soil-bentonite liner, no structural uplift stresses are present within the lining 43 system (Chen-Northern 199 1b). 44 Regional subsidence is not anticipated because neither petroleum nor extractable economic minerals are 45 present in the strata underlying the LERF basins, nor is karst (erosive limestone) topography present. 46 Addendum C.35

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 Dike soils and soil/bentonite layers were compacted thoroughly and proof-rolled during construction. 2 Calculation of settlement potential showed that combined settlement for the foundation and soil/bentonite 3 layer is expected to be about 2.7 centimeters. Settlement impact on the liner and basin stability is 4 expected to be minimal (Chen-Northem 199 1b). 5 C.5.2.1.5 Internal and External Pressure Gradients 6 Pressure gradients across the liner system from groundwater are anticipated to be negligible. The LERF 7 is about 62 meters above the seasonal high water table, which prevents buildup of water pressure below 8 the liner. The native gravel foundation materials of the LERF are relatively permeable and free draining. 9 The 2 percent slope of the secondary liner prevents the pooling of liquids on top of the secondary liner. 10 Finally, the fill rate of the basins is slow enough (average 190 liters per minute) that the load of the liquid 11 waste on the primary liner is gradually and evenly distributed. 12 To prevent the buildup of gas between the liners, each basin is equipped with 21 vents in the primary 13 geomembrane located above the maximum water level that allow the reduction of any excess gas 14 pressure. Gas passing through these vents exit through a single pipe that penetrates the anchor wall into a 15 carbon adsorption filter. This filter extracts nearly all of the organic compounds, ensuring that emissions 16 to the air from the basins are not toxic. 17 C.5.2.2 Liner System Location Relative to High-Water Table 18 The lowest point of each LERF basin is the northwest corner of the sump, where the typical subgrade 19 elevation is 175 meters above mean sea level. Based on data collected from the groundwater monitoring 20 wells at the LERF site, the seasonal high-water table is located approximately 62 meters or more below 21 the lowest point of the basins. This substantial thickness of unsaturated strata beneath the LERF provides 22 ample protection to the liner from hydrostatic pressure because of groundwater intrusion into the 23 soil/bentonite layer. Further discussion of the unsaturated zone and site hydrogeology is provided in 24 Addendum D, Groundwater Monitoring Plan. 25 C.5.2.3 Liner System Foundation 26 Foundation materials are primarily gravels and cobbles with some sand and silt. The native soils onsite 27 are derived from unconsolidated Holocene sediments. These sediments are fluvial and glaciofluvial sands 28 and gravels deposited during the most recent glacial and postglacial event. Grain-size distributions and 29 shape analyses of the sediments indicate that deposition occurred in a high-energy environment (Chen- 30 Northern 1990). 31 Analysis of five soil borings from the LERF site was conducted to characterize the natural foundation 32 materials and to determine the suitability of onsite soils for construction of the impoundment dikes and 33 determine optimal design factors. Well-graded gravel containing varying amounts of silt, sand, and 34 cobbles comprises the layer in which the basins were excavated. This gravel layer extends to depths of 35 10 to 11 meters below land surface (Chen-Northern 1990). The basins are constructed directly on the 36 subgrade. Excavated soils were screened to remove oversize cobbles (greater than 15 centimeters in the 37 largest dimension) and used to construct the dikes. 38 Settlement potential of the foundation material and soil/bentonite layer was found to be low. The 39 foundation is comprised of undisturbed native soils. The bottom of the basin excavation lies within the 40 well-graded gravel layer, and is dense to very dense. Below the gravel is a layer of dense to very dense 41 poorly graded and well-graded sand. Settlement was calculated for the gravel foundation soils and for the 42 soil/bentonite layer, under the condition of hydrostatic loading from 6.4 meters of fluid depth. The 43 combined settlement for the soils and the soil/bentonite layer is estimated to be about 2.7 centimeters. 44 This amount of settlement is expected to have minimal impact on overall liner or basin stability 45 (Chen-Northem 199 1b). Settlement calculations are provided in Calculations for Liquid Effluent 46 Retention Facility Part B Permit Application (HNF 1997). 47 Addendum C.36

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 The load bearing capacity of the foundation material, based on the soil analysis discussed previously, is 2 estimated at about 48,800 kilograms per square meter [maximum advisable presumptive bearing capacity 3 (Hough 1969)]. Anticipated static and dynamic loading from a full basin is estimated to be less than 4 9,000 kilograms per square meter (Section C.5.2.1.3), which provides an ample factor of safety. 5 When the basins are empty, excess hydrostatic pressure in the foundation materials under the liner system 6 theoretically could result in uplift and damage. However, because the native soil forming the foundations 7 is unsaturated and relatively permeable, and because the water table is located at a considerable depth 8 beneath the basins, any infiltration of surface water at the edge of the basin is expected to travel 9 predominantly downward and away from the basins, rather than collecting under the excavation itself. 10 No gas is expected in the foundation because gas-generating organic materials are not present. 11 Subsidence of undisturbed foundation materials is generally the result of fluid extraction (water or 12 petroleum), mining, or karst topography. Neither petroleum, mineral resources, nor karst are believed to 13 be present in the sediments overlying the Columbia River basalts. Potential groundwater resources do 14 exist below the LERF. Even if these sediments were to consolidate from fluid withdrawal, their depth 15 most likely would produce a broad, gently sloping area of subsidence that would not cause significant 16 strains in the LERF liner system. Consequently, the potential for subsidence related failures are expected 17 to be negligible. 18 Borings at the LERF site, and extensive additional borings in the 200 East Area, have not identified any 19 significant quantities of soluble materials in the foundation soil or underlying sediments (Last et al. 1989). 20 Consequently, the potential for sinkholes is considered negligible. 21 C.5.2.4 Liner System Exposure Prevention 22 Both primary and secondary geomembranes and the floating cover are stabilized with carbon black to 23 prevent degradation from UV light. Furthermore, none of the liner layers experience long-term exposure 24 to the elements. During construction, thin polyethylene sheeting was used to maintain optimum moisture 25 content and provide protection from the wind for the soil/bentonite layer until the secondary 26 geomembrane was laid in place. The secondary geomembrane was covered by the geonet and geotextile 27 as soon as quality control testing was complete. Once the geotextile layer was completed, drainage 28 material immediately was placed over the geotextile. The final (upper) geotextile layer was placed over 29 the drainage gravel and immediately covered by the bentonite carpet liner. This was covered 30 immediately, in turn, by the primary high-density polyethylene liner. 31 Both high-density polyethylene liners, geotextile layers, and geonet are anchored permanently to a 32 concrete wall at the top of the basin berm. During construction, liners were held in place with many 33 sandbags on both the basin bottoms and side slopes to prevent wind from lifting and damaging the 34 materials. Calculations were performed to determine the amount of fluid needed in a basin to prevent 35 wind lift damage to the primary geomembrane. Approximately 15 to 20 centimeters of solution are kept 36 in each basin to minimize the potential for uplifting the primary liner (HNF 1997). 37 The entire lining system is covered by a very low-density polyethylene floating cover that is bolted to the 38 concrete anchor wall. The floating cover prevents evaporation and intrusion from dust, precipitation, 39 vegetation, animals, and birds. A patented tensioning system is employed to prevent wind from lifting the 40 cover and automatically accommodate changes in liquid level in the basins. The cover tension 41 mechanism consists of a cable running from the flexible geosynthetic cover over a pulley on the tension 42 tower (located on the concrete anchor wall) to a dead man anchor. These anchors (blocks) simply hang 43 from the cables on the exterior side of the tension towers. The anchor wall also provides for solid 44 attachment of the liner layers and the cover, using a 6.4-millimeter batten and neoprene gasket to bolt the 45 layers to the concrete wall, effectively sealing the basin from the intrusion of light, precipitation, and 46 airborne dust (Figure C.16). 47 Addendum C.37

--- Page 892 ---
WA7890008967LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 The floating cover, made of very low-density polyethylene with UV light inhibitors, is not anticipated to 2 experience unacceptable degradation during the service life of the LERF. The very low-density 3 polyethylene material contains carbon black for UV light protection, anti-oxidants to prevent heat 4 degradation, and seaming enhancers to improve its ability to be welded. A typical manufacturer's limited 5 warranty for weathering of very low-density polyethylene products is 20 years (Poly America, undated). 6 This provides a margin of safety for the anticipated medium-term use of the LERF for aqueous waste 7 storage. 8 The upper 3.4 to 4.6 meters of the sidewall liner also could experience stresses in response to temperature 9 changes. Accommodation of thermal influences for the LERF geosynthetic layers is affected by inclusion 10 of sufficient slack as the liners were installed. Calculations demonstrate that approximately 11 67 centimeters of slack is required in the long basin bottom dimension, 46 centimeters across the basin, 12 and 34 centimeters from the bottom of the basin to the top of the basin wall (HNF 1997). 13 Thermal stresses also are experienced by the floating cover. As with the geomembranes, sufficient slack 14 was included in the design to accommodate thermal contraction and expansion. 15 C.5.2.4.1 Liner Repairs During Operations 16 Should repair of a basin liner be required while the basin is in operation, the basin contents will be 17 transferred to the 200 Area ETF or another available basin. After the liner around the leaking section is 18 cleaned, repairs to the geomembrane will be made by the application of a piece of high-density 19 polyethylene sheeting, sufficient in size to extend approximately 8 to 15 centimeters beyond the damaged 20 area, or as recommended by the vendor. A round or oval patch will be installed using the same type of 21 equipment and criteria used for the initial field installations. 22 C.5.2.4.2 Control of Air Emissions 23 The floating covers limit evaporation of aqueous waste and releases of volatile organic compounds into 24 the atmosphere. To accommodate volumetric changes in the air between the fluid in the basin and the 25 cover, and to avoid problems related to 'sealing' the basins too tightly, each basin is equipped with a 26 carbon filter breather vent system. Any air escaping from the basins must pass through this vent, 27 consisting of a pipe that penetrates the anchor wall and extends into a carbon adsorption filter unit. 28 C.5.2.5 Liner Coverage 29 The liner system covers the entire ground surface that underlies the retention basins. The primary liner 30 extends up the side slopes to a concrete anchor wall at the top of the dike encircling the entire basin 31 (Figure C.16). 32 C.5.3 Prevention of Overtopping 33 Overtopping prevention is accomplished through administrative controls and liquid-level instrumentation 34 installed in each basin. The instrumentation includes local liquid-level indication as well as remote 35 indication at the ETF. Before an aqueous waste is transferred into a basin, administrative controls are 36 implemented to ensure overtopping will not occur during the transfer. The volume of feed to be 37 transferred is compared to the available volume in the receiving basin. The transfer is not initiated unless 38 there is sufficient volume available in the receiving basin or a cut-off level is established. The transfer 39 into the basin would be stopped when this cut-off level is reached. 40 In the event of a 25-year, 24-hour storm event, precipitation would accumulate on the basin covers. 41 Through the self-tensioning design of the basin covers and maintenance of adequate freeboard, all 42 accumulated precipitation would be contained on the covers and none would flow over the dikes or 43 anchor walls. The 25-year, 24-hour storm is expected to deliver 5.3 centimeters of rain or approximately 44 61 centimeters of snow. Cover specifications include the requirement that the covers be able to withstand 45 the load from this amount of precipitation. Because the cover floats on the surface of the fluid in the 46 basin, the fluid itself provides the primary support for the weight of the accumulated precipitation. Addendum C.38

--- Page 893 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I Through the cover self-tensioning mechanism, there is ample 'give' to accommodate the overlying load 2 without overstressing the anchor and attachment points. 3 Rainwater and snow evaporate readily from the cover, particularly in the arid Hanford Facility climate, 4 where evaporation rates exceed precipitation rates for most months of the year. The black color of the 5 cover further enhances evaporation. Thus, the floating cover prevents the intrusion of precipitation into 6 the basin and provides for evaporation of accumulated rain or snow. 7 C.5.3.1 Freeboard 8 Under current operating conditions, 0.61 meter of freeboard is maintained at each LERF basin, which 9 corresponds to an operating level of 6.8 meters, or 29.5 million liters. 10 C.5.3.2 Immediate Flow Shutoff 11 The mechanism for transferring aqueous waste is either through pump transfers with on/off switches or 12 through gravity transfers with isolation valves. These methods provide positive ability to shut off 13 transfers immediately in the event of overtopping. Overtopping a basin during a transfer is very unlikely 14 because the low flow rate into the basin provides long response times. At a flow rate of 284 liters per 15 minute, approximately 11 days would be required to fill a LERF basin from the 6.8-meter operating level 16 (i.e., 0.61 meter of freeboard) to maximum capacity of 34 million liters (i.e., the 7.4-meter level). 17 C.5.3.3 Oufflow Destination 18 Aqueous waste in the LERF is transferred routinely to 200 Area ETF for treatment. However, should it 19 be necessary to immediately empty a basin, the aqueous waste either would be transferred to the 200 Area 20 ETF for treatment or transferred to another basin (or basins), whichever is faster. If necessary a 21 temporary pumping system may be installed to increase the transfer rate. 22 C.5.4 Structural Integrity of Dikes 23 The structural integrity of the dikes was certified attesting to the structural integrity of the dikes, signed 24 by a qualified, registered professional engineer. 25 C.5.4.1 Dike Design, Construction, and Maintenance 26 The dikes of the LERF are constructed of onsite native soils, generally consisting of cobbles and gravels. 27 Well-graded mixtures were specified, with cobbles up to 15 centimeters in the largest dimension, but not 28 constituting more than 20 percent of the volume of the fill. The dikes are designed with a 3:1 (3 units 29 horizontal to 1 unit vertical) slope on the basin side, and 2.25:1 on the exterior side. The dikes are 30 approximately 8.2 meters high from the bottom of the basin, and 3 meters above grade. 31 Calculations were performed to verify the structural integrity of the dikes (HNF 1997). The calculations 32 demonstrate that the structural strength of the dikes is such that, without dependence on any lining 33 system, the sides of the basins can withstand the pressure exerted by the maximum allowable quantity of 34 fluid in the impoundment. The dikes have a factor of safety greater than 2.5 against failure by sliding. 35 C.5.4.2 Dike Stability and Protection 36 In the following paragraphs, various aspects of stability for the LERF dikes and the concrete anchor wall 37 are presented, including slope failure, hydrostatic pressure, and protection from the environment. 38 Failure in Dike/Impoundment Cut Slopes. A slope stability analysis was performed to determine the 39 factor of safety against slope failure. The computer program 'PCSTABL5' from Purdue University, using 40 the modified Janbu Method, was employed to evaluate slope stability under both static and seismic 41 loading cases. One hundred surfaces per run were generated and analyzed. The assumptions used were 42 as follows (Chen-Northem 1991b): 43 * Weight of gravel: 2,160 kilograms per cubic meter. 44 * Maximum dry density of gravel: 2,315 kilograms per cubic meter. Addendum C.39

--- Page 894 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 * Mohr-Coulomb shear strength angle for gravel: minimum 33 degrees. 2 * Weight of soil/bentonite: 1,600 kilograms per cubic meter. 3 * Mohr-Coulomb shear strength angle for soil/bentonite: minimum 30 degrees. 4 * Slope: 3 horizontal: I vertical. 5 * No fluid in impoundment (worst case for stability). 6 * Soils at in-place moisture (not saturated conditions). 7 Results of the static stability analysis showed that the dike slopes were stable with a minimum factor of 8 safety of 1.77 (Chen-Northern 199 1b). 9 The standard horizontal acceleration required in the Hanford Plant Standards, "Standard Architectural- 10 Civil Design Criteria, Design Loads for Facilities" (DOE-RL 1988), for structures on the Hanford Site is 11 0.12 g. Adequate factors of safety for cut slopes in units of this type generally are considered 1.5 for 12 static conditions and 1.1 for dynamic stability (Golder 1989). Results of the stability analysis showed that 13 the LERF basin slopes were stable under horizontal accelerations of 0.10 and 0.15 g, with minimum 14 factors of safety of 1.32 and 1.17, respectively (Chen-Northern 1991b). Printouts from the PCSTABL5 15 program are provided in Calculations for Liquid Effluent Retention Facility Part B Permit Application 16 (HNF 1997). 17 Hydrostatic Pressure. Failure of the dikes due to buildup of hydrostatic pressure, caused by failure of 18 the leachate system or liners, is very unlikely. The liner system is constructed with two essentially 19 impermeable layers consisting of a synthetic layer overlying a soil layer with low-hydraulic conductivity. 20 It would require a catastrophic failure of both liners to cause hydrostatic pressures that could endanger 21 dike integrity. Routine inspections of the leachate detection system, indicating quantities of leachate 22 removed from the basins, provide an early warning of leakage or operational problems that could lead to 23 excessive hydrostatic pressure. A significant precipitation event (e.g., a 25-year, 24-hour storm) will not 24 create a hydrostatic problem because the interior sidewalls of the basins are covered completely by the 25 liners. The covers can accommodate this volume of precipitation without overtopping the dike 26 (Section C.5.3), and the coarse nature of the dike and foundation materials on the exterior walls provides 27 for rapid drainage of precipitation away from the basins. 28 Protection from Root Systems. Risk to structural integrity of the dikes because of penetrating root 29 systems is minimal. Excavation and construction removed all vegetation on and around the 30 impoundments, and native plants (such as sagebrush) grow very slowly. The large grain size of the 31 cobbles and gravel used as dike construction material do not provide an advantageous germination 32 medium for native plants. Should plants with extending roots become apparent on the dike walls, the 33 plants will be controlled with appropriate herbicide application. 34 Protection from Burrowing Mammals. The cobble size materials that make up the dike construction 35 material and the exposed nature of the dike sidewalls do not offer an advantageous habitat for burrowing 36 mammals. Lack of vegetation on the LERF site discourages foraging. The risk to structural integrity of 37 the dikes from burrowing mammals is therefore minimal. Periodic visual inspections of the dikes provide 38 observations of any animals present. Should burrowing mammals be noted onsite, appropriate pest 39 control methods such as trapping or application of rodenticides will be employed. 40 Protective Cover. Approximately 7.6 centimeters of crushed gravel serve as the cover of the exterior 41 dike walls. This coarse material is inherently resistant to the effect of wind because of its large grain size. 42 Total annual precipitation is low (16 centimeters) and a significant storm event (e.g., a 25-year, 24-hour 43 storm) could result in about 5.3 centimeters of precipitation in a 24-hour period. The absorbent capacity 44 of the soil exceeds this precipitation rate; therefore, the impact of wind and precipitation run-on to the 45 exterior dike walls will be minimal. Addendum C.40

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 C.5.5 Piping Systems 2 Aqueous waste from the 242-A Evaporator is transferred to the LERF using a pump located in the 3 242-A Evaporator and approximately 1,500 meters of pipe, consisting of a 3-inch carrier pipe within a 4 6-inch outer containment pipeline. Flow through the pump is controlled through a valve at flow rates 5 from 150 to 300 liters per minute. The pipeline exits the 242-A Evaporator below grade and remains 6 below grade at a minimum 1.2 meter depth for freeze protection, until the pipeline emerges at the LERF 7 catch basin, at the corner of each basin. All piping at the catch basin that is less than 1.2 meters below 8 grade is wrapped with electric heat tracing tape and insulated for protection from freezing. 9 The transfer line from the 242-A Evaporator is centrifugally cast, fiberglass-reinforced epoxy thermoset 10 resin pressure pipe fabricated to meet the requirements of ASME D2997 (ASME 1984). The 3-inch 11 carrier piping is centered and supported within 6-inch containment piping. Pipe supports are fabricated of 12 the same material as the pipe, and meet the strength requirements of ANSI B31.3 (ANSI 1987) for dead 13 weight, thermal, and seismic loads. A catch basin is provided at the northwest comer of each basin where 14 piping extends from the basin to allow for basin-to-basin and basin-to-200 Area ETF liquid transfers. 15 Drawing H-2-88766, Sheets I through 4, provide schematic diagrams of the piping system at LERF. 16 Drawing H-2-79604 provides details of the piping from the 242-A Evaporator to LERF. 17 C.5.5.1 Secondary Containment System for Piping 18 The 6-inch containment piping encases the 3-inch carrier pipe from the 242-A Evaporator to the LERF. 19 All of the piping and fittings that are not directly over a catch basin or a basin liner are of this pipe- 20 within-a-pipe construction. A catch basin is provided at the northwest corner of each basin where the 21 inlet pipes, leachate risers, and transfer pipe risers emerge from the basin. The catch basin consists of a 22 20-centimeter-thick concrete pad at the top of the dike. The perimeter of the catch basin has a 23 20-centimeter-high curb, and the concrete is coated with a chemical resistant epoxy sealant. The concrete 24 pad is sloped so that any leaks or spills from the piping or pipe connections will drain into the basin. The 25 catch basin provides an access point for inspecting, servicing, and operating various systems such as 26 transfer valving, leachate level instrumentation and leachate pump. Drawing H-2-79593 provides a 27 schematic diagram of the catch basins. 28 C.5.5.2 Leak Detection System 29 During operation, the 242-A Evaporator receives dilute tank waste directly from the Tank Farms, treats 30 waste by evaporation, and returns the concentrated waste to Tank Farms. The process condensate which 31 is generated is transferred to LERF. Single-point electronic leak detection elements are installed along 32 the transfer line at 305-meter intervals. The leak detection elements are located in the bottom of specially 33 designed test risers. Each sensor element employs a conductivity sensor, which is connected to a cable 34 leading back to the 242-A Evaporator control room. If a leak develops in the carrier pipe, fluid will travel 35 down the exterior surface of the carrier pipe or the interior of the containment pipe. As moisture contacts 36 a sensor unit, an alarm sounds in the ETF control room, which is monitored continuously when the 242-A 37 evaporator is transferring liquids to LERF. If the alarm sounds, ETF Operations staff troubleshoots the 38 alarm and, upon verification of a leak, requests that the pump located in the 242-A Evaporator be shut 39 down to stop the flow of process condensate through the transfer line. The 242-A Evaporator has limited 40 surge capacity, and its operation is closely tied to supporting Tank Farm operations. The flow of process 41 condensate to LERF is not stopped automatically by indication of a possible leak in the primary transfer 42 line. A low-volume air purge of the annulus between the carrier pipe and the containment pipe is 43 provided to prevent condensation buildup and minimize false alarms by the leak detection elements. 44 The catch basins have conductivity leak detectors that alarm in the ETF control room. Leak detector 45 alarms are monitored in the control room continuously during aqueous waste transfers and at least daily 46 when no transfers are occurring. Leaks into the catch basins drain back to the basin through a 5.1- 47 centimeter drain on the floor of the catch basin. Addendum C.41

WA7890008967LERF and 200 Area ETF I C.5.5.3 Certification 2 Although an integrity assessment is not required for piping associated with surface impoundments, an 3 assessment of the transfer liner was performed, including a hydrostatic leak/pressure test at 4 10.5 kilograms per square centimeter gauge. A statement by an independent, qualified, registered 5 professional engineer attesting to the integrity of the piping system is included in Integrity Assessment 6 Report for the 242-A Evaporator/LERF Waste Transfer Piping, Project W105 (WHC 1993), along with 7 the results of the leak/pressure test. 8 C.5.6 Double Liner and Leak Detection, Collection, and Removal System 9 The double-liner system for LERF is discussed in Section C.5.2. The leachate detection, collection, and 10 removal system (Figure C.18) as designed and constructed to remove leachate that might permeate the 11 primary liner. System components for each basin include: 12 * 30.5-centimeter layer of drainage gravel below the primary liner at the bottom of the basin 13 * Geonet below the primary liner on the sidewalls to direct leachate to the gravel layer 14 * 3.0-meter by 1.8-meter by 0.30-meter-deep leachate collection sump consisting of a 25 millimeter 15 high-density polyethylene flat stock, geotextile to trap large particles in the leachate, and 16 1.5-millimeter high-density polyethylene rub sheet set on the secondary liner 17 * 10-inch and 4-inch perforated leachate high-density polyethylene riser pipes from the leachate 18 collection sump to the catch basin northwest of the basin 19 * Leachate collection sump level instrumentation installed in the 4-inch riser 20 * Level sensors, submersible leachate pump, and 1.5-inch fiberglass-reinforced epoxy thermoset 21 resin pressure piping installed in the 10-inch riser 22 * Piping at the catch basin to route the leachate through 1.5-inch high-density polyethylene pipe 23 back to the basins 24 The bottom of the basins has a two percent slope to allow gravity flow of leachate to the leachate 25 collection sump. This exceeds the minimum of 1 percent slope required by WAC 173-303-650(j) for new 26 surface impoundments. Material specifications for the leachate collection system are given in 27 Section C.5.2.1.1. 28 Calculations demonstrate that fluid from a small hole (2 millimeter) (EPA 1989, p. 122) at the furthest 29 end of the basin, under a low head situation, would travel to the sump in less than 24 hours (HNF 1997). 30 Additional calculations indicate the capacity of the pump to remove leachate is sufficient to allow time to 31 readily identify a leak and activate emergency procedures (HNF 1997). 32 The fluid level in each leachate sump is required to be maintained below 33 centimeters to prevent 33 significant liquid backup into the drainage layer. The leachate pump is activated when the liquid level in 34 the sump reaches about 28 centimeters, and is shut off when the sump liquid level reaches about 35 18 centimeters. This operation may be done either manually or automatically. Liquid level control is 36 accomplished with conductivity probes that trigger relays selected specifically for application to 37 submersible pumps and leachate fluids. A flow meter/totalizer on the leachate return pipe measures fluid 38 volumes pumped and pumping rate from the leachate collection sumps, and indicates volume and flow 39 'rate on local readouts. In addition, a timer on the leachate pump tracks the cumulative pump operating 40 time. Other instrumentation provided is real-time continuous level monitoring with readout at the catch 41 basin. Leachate levels are monitored at least weekly. A sampling port is provided in the leachate piping 42 system at the catch basin. The leak rate through the primary liner can be calculated using two methods: 1) 43 measured as the leachate flow meter/totalizer readings (flow meters/totalizers are located on the outflow 44 line from the collection sumps in the bottom of the LERF basins), and 2) calculated using the pump 45 operating time readings multiplied by the pump flow rate (the pump runs at a constant flow rate). 46 Calculations using either method are sufficient for compliance. For more information on inspections, 47 refer to Addendum 1. Addendum C.42

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 The stainless steel leachate pump delivers 5 gallons per minute (19 liters per minute). The leachate pump 2 returns draw liquid from the sump via 1.5-inch pipe and discharges into the basin through 1.5-inch high- 3 density polyethylene pipe. 4 C.5.7 Construction Quality Assurance 5 The construction quality assurance plan and complete report of construction quality assurance inspection 6 and testing results are provided in 242-A Evaporator Interim Retention Basin Construction Quality 7 Assurance Plan (KEH 1991). A general description of construction quality assurance procedures is 8 outlined in the following paragraphs. 9 For excavation of the basins and construction of the dikes, regular inspections were conducted to ensure 10 compliance with procedures and drawings, and compaction tests were performed on the dike soils. 11 For the soil/bentonite layer, test fills were first conducted in accordance with EPA guidance to 12 demonstrate compaction procedures and to confirm compaction and permeability requirements can be 13 met. The ratio of bentonite to soil and moisture content was monitored; lifts did not exceed 14 15 centimeters before compaction, and specific compaction procedures were followed. Laboratory and 15 field tests of soil properties were performed for each lift and for the completed test fill. The same suite of 16 tests was conducted for each lift during the laying of the soil/bentonite admixture in the basins. 17 Geotextiles and geomembranes were laid in accordance with detailed procedures and quality assurance 18 programs provided by the manufacturers and installers. These included destructive and nondestructive 19 tests on the geomembrane seams, and documentation of field test results and repairs. 20 C.5.8 Proposed Action Leakage Rate and Response Action Plan 21 An action leakage rate limit is established where action must be taken due to excessive leakage from the 22 primary liner. The action leak rate is based on the maximum design flow rate the leak detection system 23 can remove without the fluid head on the bottom liner exceeding 30 centimeters. The limiting factor in 24 the leachate removal rate is the hydraulic conductivity of the drainage gravel. An action leakage rate 25 (also called the rapid or large leak rate) of 20,000 liters per hectare per day (2,100 gallons/acre/day) was 26 calculated for each basin (WHC 1992b). 27 When it is determined that the action leakage rate has been exceeded, the response action plan will follow 28 the actions in WAC 173-303-650(1 1)(b) and (c), which includes notification of Ecology in writing 29 within 7 days, assessing possible causes of the leak, and determining whether waste receipt should be 30 curtailed and/or the basin emptied. 31 C.5.9 Dike Structural Integrity Engineering Certification 32 The structural integrity of the dikes was certified attesting to the structural integrity of the dikes, signed 33 by a qualified, registered professional engineer. 34 C.S.10 Management of Ignitable, Reactive, or Incompatible Wastes 35 Although ignitable or reactive aqueous waste might be received in small quantities at LERF, such 36 aqueous waste is mixed with dilute solutions in the basins, removing the ignitable or reactive 37 characteristics. For compatibility requirements with the LERF liner, refer to Addendum B, Waste 38 Analysis Plan. 39 C.6 Air Emissions Control 40 This section addresses the 200 Area ETF requirements of Air Emission Standards for Process Vents, 41 under 40 CFR 264, Subpart AA (WAC 173-303-690 incorporated by reference) and Subpart CC. The 42 requirements of 40 CFR 264, Subpart BB (WAC 173-303-691) is not applicable because aqueous waste 43 with 10 percent or greater organic concentration would not be acceptable for processing at the ETF. Addendum C.43

--- Page 898 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 C.6.1 Applicability of Subpart AA Standards 2 The 200 Area ETF evaporator and thin film dryer perform operations that specifically require evaluation 3 for applicability of WAC 173-303-690. Aqueous waste in these units routinely contains greater than 10 4 parts per million concentrations of organic compounds and are, therefore, subject to air emission 5 requirements under WAC 173-303-690. Organic emissions from all affected process vents on the 6 Hanford Facility must be less than 1.4 kilograms per hour and 2.8 mega grams per year, or control 7 devices must be installed to reduce organic emissions by 95 percent. 8 The vessel off gas system provides a process vent system. This system provides a slight vacuum on the 9 200 Area ETF process vessels and tanks (refer to Section C.2.5.2). Two vessel vent header pipes 10 combine and enter the vessel off gas system filter unit consisting of a demister, electric heater, prefilter, 11 high-efficiency particulate air filters, activated carbon absorber, and two exhaust fans (one fan in service 12 while the other is backup). The vessel off gas system filter unit is located in the high-efficiency 13 particulate air filter room west of the process area. The vessel off gas system exhaust discharges into the 14 larger building ventilation system, with the exhaust fans and stack located outside and immediately west 15 of the ETF. The exhaust stack discharge point is 15.5 meters above ground level. 16 The annual average flow rate for the 200 Area ETF stack (which is the combined vessel off gas and 17 building exhaust flow rates) is 1600 cubic meters per minute with a total annual flow of approximately 18 8.4 E+08 cubic meters. During waste processing, the airflow through just the vessel off gas system is 19 about 23 standard cubic meters per minute. 20 Organic emissions occur during waste processing, which occurs less than 310 days each year 21 (i.e., 85 percent operating efficiency). This operating efficiency represents the maximum annual 22 operating time for the ETF, as shutdowns are required during the year for planned maintenance outages 23 and for reconfiguring the 200 Area ETF to accommodate different aqueous waste. 24 C.6.2 Process Vents -Demonstrating Compliance 25 This section outlines how the 200 Area ETF complies with the requirements and includes a discussion of 26 the basis for meeting the organic emissions limits, calculations demonstrating compliance, and conditions 27 for reevaluation. 28 C.6.2.1 Basis for Meeting Limits/Reductions 29 The 242-A Evaporator and the 200 Area ETF are currently the only operating TSD units that contribute to 30 the Hanford Facility volatile organic emissions under 40 CFR 264, Subpart AA. The combined release 31 rate is currently well below the threshold of 1.4 kilograms per hour or 2,800 kilograms per year of volatile 32 organic compounds. As a result, the 200 Area ETF meets these standards without the use of air pollution 33 control devices. 34 The amount of organic emissions could change as waste streams are changed, or TSD units are brought 35 online or are deactivated. The organic air emissions summation will be re-evaluated periodically as 36 condition warrants. Operations of the TSD units operating under 40 CFR 264, Subpart AA, will be 37 controlled to maintain Hanford Facility emissions below the threshold limits or pollution control device(s) 38 will be added, as necessary, to achieve the reduction standards specified under 40 CFR 264, Subpart AA. 39 C.6.2.2 Demonstrating Compliance 40 Calculations to determine organic emissions are performed using the following assumptions: 41 * Maximum flow rate from LERF to 200 Area ETF is 568 liters per minute. 42 * Emissions of organics from tanks and vessels upstream of the UV/OX process are determined 43 from flow and transfer rates given in Clean Air Act Requirements, WAC 173-400 As-built 44 Documentation, Project C-018H, 242-A Evaporator/P UREX Plant Process Condensate 45 Treatment Facility (Adtechs 1995). 46 Addendum C.44

--- Page 899 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 * UV/OX reaction rate constants and residence times are used to determine the amount of organics, 2 which are destroyed in the UV/OX process. These constants are given in 200 Area Effluent 3 Treatment Facility Delisting Petition (DOE/RL 1992). 4 * All organic compounds that are not destroyed in the UV/OX process are assumed to be emitted 5 from the tanks and vessels into the vessel off gas system. 6 * No credit for removal of organic compounds in the vessel off gas system carbon absorber unit is 7 taken. The activated carbon absorbers are used if required to reduce organic emissions. 8 The calculation to determine organic emissions consists of the following steps: 9 1. Determine the quantity of organics emitted from the tanks or vessels upstream of the UV/OX 10 process, using transfer rate values 11 2. Determine the concentration of organics in the waste after the UV/OX process using UV/OX 12 reaction rates and residence times. If the 200 Area ETF is configured such that the UV/OX 13 process is not used, a residence time of zero is used in the calculations (i.e., none of the organics 14 are destroyed) 15 3. Assuming all the remaining organics are emitted, determine the rate which the organics are 16 emitted using the feed flow rate and the concentrations of organics after the UV/OX process 17 4. The amount of organics emitted from the vessel off gas system is the sum of the amount 18 calculated in steps I and 3. 19 The organic emission rates and quantity of organics emitted during processing are determined using these 20 calculations and are included in the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF and 200 Area ETF file. 21 C.6.2.3 Reevaluating Compliance with Subpart AA Standards 22 Calculations to determine compliance with Subpart AA will be reviewed when any of the following 23 conditions occur at the 200 Area ETF: 24 * Changes in the maximum feed rate to the 200 Area ETF (i.e., greater than the 568 liters per 25 minute flow rate) 26 * Changes in the configuration or operation of the 200 Area ETF that would modify the 27 assumptions given in Section C.6.2.2 (e.g., taking credit for the carbon absorbers as a control 28 device) 29 * Annual operating time exceeds 310 days. 30 C.6.3 Applicability of Subpart CC Standards 31 The air emission standards of 40 CFR 264, Subpart CC apply to tank, surface impoundment, and 32 container storage units that manage wastes with average volatile organic concentrations equal to or 33 exceeding 500 parts per million by weight, based on the hazardous waste composition at the point of 34 origination (61 FR 59972). However, TSD units that are used solely for management of mixed waste are 35 exempt. Mixed waste is managed at the LERF and 200 Area ETF and dangerous waste could be treated 36 and stored at these TSD units. 37 TSD owner/operators are not required to determine the concentration of volatile organic compounds in a 38 hazardous waste if the wastes are placed in waste management units that employ air emission controls 39 that comply with the Subpart CC standards. Therefore, the approach to Subpart CC compliance at the 40 LERF and 200 Area ETF is to demonstrate that the LERF and 200 Area ETF meet the Subpart CC control 41 standards (40 CFR 264.1084 -40 CFR 264.1086). 42 C.6.3.1 Demonstrating Compliance with Subpart CC for Tanks 43 Since the 200 Area ETF tanks already have process vents regulated under 40 CFR 264, Subpart AA 44 (WAC 173-303-690), they are exempt from Subpart CC [40 CFR 264.1080(b)(8)].

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I C.6.3.2 Demonstrating Compliance with Subpart CC for Containers 2 Container Level 1 and Level 2 standards are met at the 200 Area ETF by managing all dangerous and/or 3 mixed wastes in U.S. Department of Transportation containers [40 CFR 264.1086(f)]. Level 1 containers 4 are those that store more than 0.1 cubic meters and less than or equal to 0.46 cubic meters. Level 2 5 containers are used to store more than 0.46 cubic meters of waste, which are in 'light material service'. 6 Light material service is defined where a waste in the container has one or more organic constituents 7 with a vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kilopascals at 20 C, and the total concentration of such 8 constituents is greater than or equal to 20 percent by weight. 9 The monitoring requirements for Level I and Level 2 containers include a visual inspection when the 10 container is received at the 200 Area ETF and when the waste is initially placed in the container. 11 Additionally, at least once every 12 months when stored onsite for 1 year or more, these containers must 12 be inspected. 13 If compliant containers are not used at the 200 Area ETF, alternate container management practices are 14 used that comply with the Level I standards. Specifically, the Level I standards allow for a "container 15 equipped with a cover and closure devices that form a continuous barrier over the container openings such 16 that when the cover and closure devices are secured in the closed position there are no visible holes, gaps, 17 or other open spaces into the interior of the container. The cover may be a separate cover installed on the 18 container...or may be an integral part of the container structural design..." [40 CFR 264.1086(c)(1)(ii)]. 19 An organic-vapor-suppressing barrier, such as foam, may also be used [40 CFR 264.1086(c)(1)(iii)]. 20 Section C.3 provides detail on container management practices at the 200 Area ETF. 21 Container Level 3 standards apply when a container is used for the "treatment of a hazardous waste by a 22 waste stabilization process" [40 CFR 264.1086(2)]. Because treatment in containers using the 23 stabilization process is not provided at the 200 Area ETF, these standards do not apply. 24 C.6.3.3 Demonstrating Compliance with Subpart CC for Surface Impoundments 25 The Subpart CC emission standards are met at LERF using a floating membrane cover that is constructed 26 of very-low-density polyethylene that forms a continuous barrier over the entire surface area 27 [40 CFR 264.1085(c)]. This membrane has both organic permeability properties equivalent to a high- 28 density polyethylene cover and chemical/physical properties that maintain the material integrity for the 29 intended service life of the material. The additional requirements for the floating cover at the LERF have 30 been met (Section C.5.2.4). 31 C.7 Engineering Drawings 32 C.7.1 Liquid Effluent Retention Facility 33 Drawings of the containment systems at the LERF are summarized in Table C. 1. Because the failure of 34 these containment systems at LERF could lead to the release of dangerous waste into the environment, 35 modifications that affect these containment systems will be submitted to the Washington State 36 Department of Ecology, as a Class 1, 2, or 3 Permit modification, as required by WAC 173-303-830. 37 Table C.1.

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 D Groundwater Monitoring Plan, Liquid Effluent Retention Facility 2 This document describes a groundwater monitoring program for the Liquid Effluent Retention Facility 3 (LERF) (Figure D-1). LERF is a regulated unit under RCW 70.105, "Hazardous Waste Management," 4 and is subject to groundwater monitoring requirements pursuant to WAC 173-303-645, "Dangerous 5 Waste Regulations," "Releases from Regulated Units." 6 D1 Introduction 7 This plan describes the LERF groundwater monitoring program, including the monitoring network, 8 constituent list, sampling schedule, sampling and analysis protocols, and data evaluation and reporting 9 methods for LERF groundwater monitoring. Four monitoring wells at LERF (299-E26-10, 299-E26-14, 10 299-E26-77, and 299-E26-79) provide a monitoring network for establishing the groundwater gradient, 11 and two monitoring wells (299-E26-14 and 299-E26-79) provide upgradient-downgradient comparisons 12 for detection monitoring, respectively (Figure D-2). 13 D1.1 History of Groundwater Monitoring at the Liquid Effluent Retention Facility 14 A four-well groundwater monitoring program was established at LERF in 1990 before final construction 15 of the regulated unit. One well (299-E26-1 1) was completed to the east of LERF as an upgradient 16 monitoring well, and three wells (299-E26-9, 299-E26-10, and 299-E35-2) were completed west of LERF 17 as downgradient monitoring wells. Well 299-E26-77, a replacement well for well 299-E26-9, was located 18 approximately 5 m (15 ft) to the southeast of well 299-E26-9 and because of the scale for Figure D-2, 19 only well 299-E26-77 is identified. Samples were collected quarterly from the four monitoring wells, and 20 evaluation of indicator parameters began before waste was transferred to the basins. Analytes listed in 21 Appendix III, "EPA Interim Primary Drinking Water Standards," of 40 CFR 265, "Interim Status 22 Standards for Owners and Operators of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities," 23 Subpart F, "Ground-Water Monitoring," were sampled to establish the suitability of the groundwater as a 24 drinking water supply, as well as several other site-specific constituents the first year of sample 25 collection. Total organic carbon (TOC), total organic halides (TOX), pH, and specific conductivity 26 (indicator parameters) also were analyzed during the first year to derive upgradient/downgradient 27 comparison values for these parameters based on requirements of 40 CFR 265, Subpart F. Detection 28 monitoring continued on a semiannual schedule. Two wells, 299-E26-9 and 299-E35-2, could no longer 29 yield representative samples of groundwater in 1999 and 2001, respectively, due to declining water levels. 30 As a result, inter-well statistical evaluation of LERF groundwater monitoring data has not been performed 31 since 2001. Sampling continued at former downgradient well 299-E26-10 and former upgradient well 32 299-E26-1 1. Wells 299-E26-77 and 299-E26-79 were drilled and completed in 2008 to define the aquifer 33 flow rate, flow direction, and hydrogeologic conditions (SGW-41072, Liquid Effluent Retention Facility 34 Characterization Report) (Figure D-2). These wells are located west and south of LERF, respectively, 35 and were sampled concurrently with existing wells beginning in January 2009. Water level 36 measurements, after incorporation of the two new wells, demonstrated two different flow conditions, 37 westerly when incorporating well 299-E26-11 and more southerly when data for well 299-E26-11 are not 38 incorporated (SGW-41072). Because of the uncertainty in flow direction, another well, 299-E26-14, was 39 installed north of LERF to clarify current groundwater flow direction. A geophysical investigation was 40 employed to target the best hydraulic location for well 299-E26-14 as discussed further in Section D2. 1.1 41 (Figure D-3). In September 2011, well 299-E26-14 was installed. After two years of water level 42 measurements using well 299-E26-14 and the three other wells (299-E26-10, 299-E26-77, and 43 299-E26-79), the flow direction was considered southward (discussed further in Section 2.2.2). Various 44 chemical analyses were completed over the past two years to provide an upgradient baseline for 45 dangerous waste constituents specified in this permit. D-1

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 D1.2 Facility Description 2 The following subsections provide an overview of the physical structures, operational history, and waste 3 characteristics of LERF. Additional details are provided in Addendum B (Waste Analysis Plan) and 4 Addendum C (Process Information). 5 D1.3 Physical Structure 6 LERF is located in the central portion of the Hanford Site on the eastern boundary of the 200 East Area 7 (Figure D-1). Construction of LERF was completed in 1991. The LERF basins consist of three dangerous 8 waste management units classified as surface impoundments: Basins 42, 43, and 44 (Figure D-2). 9 The LERF design uses a dual confinement barrier concept (i.e., dual basin liners and pipe-in-a-pipe 10 transfer piping system) to minimize human exposure and potential for accidental releases to the 11 environment. A leachate detection, collection, and removal system and basin covers are designed to 12 reduce possible environmental or personnel exposures. The leachate detection system is monitored, as 13 required, by the LERF-Effluent Treatment Facility (ETF) permit conditions and Addendum I. 14 LERF is a 15.8 ha (39 ac) site with three 2.9 x 107 L (7.8 million gal) capacity basins (Figure D-2). 15 The basins are arranged side by side with 18.2 m (60 ft) separations between each basin. The dimensions 16 of each basin (cell) are 100.5 by 82.2 m (330 by 270 ft), with a maximum fluid depth of 6.7 m (22 ft). 17 The side slopes of the basin have a slope ratio of 3:1. 18 The primary liner for each basin is a 60 mil, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane laid 19 directly over a manufactured geotextile/bentonite carpet layer. The secondary liner is also a 60 mil HDPE 20 geomembrane laid directly on 0.9 m (36 in.) of a soil/bentonite mixture. The liners are separated by a 21 synthetic drainage geonet laid on the sides of the basins, with 0.3 m (12 in.) of drainage gravel at the 22 bottom. The sides slope to a sump, which is pumped when the liquid level reaches approximately 28 cm 23 (11 in.) and shuts off when it drops to 18 cm (7 in.). Each basin has a mechanically tensioned cover of 24 very low density polyethylene construction, which is anchored to the perimeter concrete ring wall of the 25 basins with batten plates. 26 D1.4 Operational History 27 LERF was constructed for interim storage and treatment for aqueous waste streams prior to final 28 treatment in the 200 Area ETF. Treatment at LERF consists of flow and pH equalization. The flow 29 equalization allows for several smaller waste streams that are intermittently received at the LERF basins 30 to accumulate for continuous higher volume campaign processing at ETF. The pH equalization allows for 31 a uniform wastewater to optimize ETF process campaigns. 32 LERF began receiving process condensate from the 242-A Evaporator in 1994. In 1995, several new 33 liquid waste feeds were identified for treatment at LERF. These waste streams included Environmental 34 Restoration Disposal Facility (ERDF) leachate, purge water from groundwater monitoring, B Plant waste, 35 and 200-UP-1 groundwater remediation. Between 2000 and 2013, the majority of the liquid waste 36 received at LERF was associated with the following in descending order: 200-UP-1/200-ZP-1 37 groundwater (181.4 million gal), ERDF leachate (16 million gal), process condensate from the 242-A 38 Evaporator (7.3 million gal), Mixed Waste Burial Trenches leachate (2.9 million gal), K Basins 39 (1.9 million gal), and purge water (1.8 million gal). 40 Projected ETF influent waste streams for 2010 through 2028 are presented in HNF-23142, Engineering 41 Study for the 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility Secondary Waste Treatment of Projected Future 42 Waste Feeds.

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 D1.5 Waste Characteristics 2 As a unit of LERF, the 200 Area ETF was designed to treat a variety of aqueous wastes containing both 3 chemical and radiological contaminants. This aqueous waste is collected in the three LERF basins before 4 transfer to ETF for efficient operations. Before a liquid waste can be transferred to ETF or LERF by a 5 waste generator, a waste profile of the subject waste must be developed. This waste profile is compared 6 against the ETF/LERF acceptance criteria, as explained in Addendum B, "Waste Analysis Plan." 7 Waste streams that have been approved are also periodically re-evaluated for waste characteristics. 8 The results of these periodic re-evaluations (provided in this subsection) help identify reliable chemical 9 contaminants that can be used as or for additional indicator parameters for detection monitoring 10 (as described in WAC 173-303-645(9)(a)). Waste characteristics for liquid effluents that have been 11 historically stored in the three LERF basins (Basins 42, 43, and 44) are provided in the following 12 subsections. 13 D1.6 Basin 42 14 Various aqueous waste streams feed Basin 42; however, the 242-A Evaporator waste stream has been the 15 largest volume waste stream associated with Basin 42. Over the past 13 years (1999 through 2012), 16 the liquid volume associated with the 242-A Evaporator waste was 10 times that of any other waste 17 streams sent to Basin 42. Maximum concentration limits for the 242-A Evaporator waste stream during 18 initial startup were provided in WHC-SD-W105-SAR-001, Final Safety Analysis Report 242-A 19 Evaporator Liquid Effluent Retention Facility. When the maximum concentrations for the 242-A 20 Evaporator waste stream (Table 9.6 of WHC-SD-W105-SAR-001) were compared with the average 21 contaminant concentration levels (2009 through 2010 weighted average liquid concentrations) in Basin 42 22 (Table D-1), nearly all of the average Basin 42 concentrations were lower. Constituents with greater 23 concentrations were limited to two anions (chloride and sulfate), one cation (calcium), and four trace 24 metals (barium, manganese, uranium, and zinc). These constituents appear to be associated with other 25 waste streams such as the Mixed Waste Trenches 31 and 34 leachate and Hanford Site purge water which 26 had the second and third largest waste streams by volume. The other 17 waste streams associated with 27 Basin 42 make up approximately 2 percent of the volume. 28 The makeup of Basin 42 is similar to the groundwater wells upgradient of the Hanford Site or regional 29 background groundwater concentrations, except for alkalinity, nitrogen, and sulfate. A comparison 30 between Basin 42 wastewater and upgradient Hanford Site wells can be seen in the appropriate Table D-1 31 columns (e.g., 2009 Basin 42 Characterization Results and Basin 42 Average versus Regional 32 Background Concentration of Table D-1). In general, regional groundwater background concentrations 33 are similar to groundwater concentrations beneath LERF, except for anions. Although Basin 42 and 34 groundwater beneath Basin 42 share a common suite of elevated constituents (anions), the source of the 35 elevated anions in the groundwater is from a crossgradient/upgradient groundwater location. 36 The crossgradient/upgradient groundwater location is shown by historical groundwater results at well 37 299-E34-7 prior to the start of LERF and more recently at the LERF upgradient well 299-E27-14 38 (Figure D-4). By comparison, the average concentrationi of sulfate in Basin 42 (55.6 mg/L) is much less 39 than the historical sulfate concentration at well 299-E34-7 of 671 mg/L (sample date 4/3/2003). 40 Even characterization results from Basins 42, 43, and 44 (Tables D-1, D-2, and D-3) do not compare with 41 the maximum groundwater results at well 299-E34-7. The same is true for nitrate in Basin 42 as compared 42 with nitrate at the crossgradient/upgradient well 299-E34-7. Only the contributions of the 200-BP-5 43 perched water waste streams from Basin 43 and ERDF leachate exceed the groundwater results at well 44 299-E34-7. However, because of the nature of the elevated groundwater results at well 299-E34-7, 45 including elevated TOC, and the relationship to past unplanned releases (UPRs) near well 299-E34-7 1 All concentrations are reported as a weighted average.

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 (e.g., UPR-200-E-32 associated with the 216-B-2-1 Ditch and UPR-200-E-138 associated with the 2 216-B-2-2 Ditch [Figure D-1]), the elevated groundwater results at well 299-E34-7 appear to be from a 3 source other than LERF (Figure D-5). The UPRs (e.g., UPR-200-E-32 and UPR-200-E-138) were 4 associated with B Plant fractionation waste that had significant levels of nitrate, sulfate, and organic 5 carbon. The nature of these UPRs appears more characteristic of the levels reported at well 299-E34-7. 6 Well 299-E26-10, located to the west of LERF, appears to mimic the historical results at well 299-E34-7 7 (Figure D-4). As the nitrate and sulfate concentrations decrease over time, if concentrations follow the 8 earlier trends at well 299-E34-7, these constituents may become more appropriate as indicator parameters 9 at LERF. However, the concentration of these constituents in LERF Basins would not be distinguishable 10 from current groundwater conditions beneath LERF. Because nitrate and sulfate may become more 11 appropriate indicator parameters in the future, they will serve currently as groundwater quality parameters 12 at the LERF monitoring wells. Because specific conductance is an indicator of nitrate and sulfate changes, 13 specific conductance will be added as an indicator parameter for documentation of local changes and 14 comparison between the upgradient and downgradient monitoring wells. 15 None of the toxicity characteristic of dangerous waste constituents received by Basin 42 exceed toxicity 16 characteristics list threshold values (WAC 173-303-090(8)(c), "Dangerous Waste Regulations," 17 "Dangerous Waste Characteristics"). Six of the potentially dangerous waste metal constituent results in 18 the basin were above groundwater background levels (Table D-1): chromium, copper, lead, mercury, 19 nickel, and thallium. Although the results are above the groundwater background levels, the results would 20 not be detectable at groundwater compliance points should there be a potential release into the upper 21 aquifer because of the low waste stream concentrations and dispersive effect associated with infiltrating 22 waste into the groundwater. 23 There were low levels of organics found in Basin 42 with 1-butanol (288 jtg/L) having the highest 24 weighted average. The chemical nature of 1-butanol (e.g., rapidly degrades in water and has a relatively 25 high detection level 100 gg/L) makes this constituent an unlikely indicator parameter. 26 In conclusion, no reliable waste constituent indicator parameters are presently available for Basin 42 27 groundwater detection. 28 D1.7 Basin 43 29 The largest volume of waste waters received by Basin 43 was the contaminated groundwater from the 30 200-UP-1/200-ZP-1 operable units (OUs) groundwater pumping systems (Table D-2). 31 The 200-UP-1/200-ZP-1 OUs waste stream had 20 times more volume sent to LERF than the next closest 32 waste stream (ERDF leachate) over the past decade and a half. The 200-UP-1/200-ZP-1 OUs groundwater 33 effluent waste characteristics are contained in Table D-2. Tables D-2 and D-3 provides characteristics of 34 the ERDF leachate. Table D-2 provides characteristics of ERDF leachate in Basin 43 in 2012 after receipt 35 of the 200-UP-1/200-ZP-1 OUs groundwater effluent waste was terminated, and Table D-3 provides the 36 average ERDF leachate characterization results for Basin 44 from 2000 through September 2011. Overall, 37 the waste characteristics in Basin 43 are most comparable to the waste streams from 200-UP-1/200-ZP- 1 38 OUs groundwater pumping systems because of its significant volume compared with the other waste 39 streams. 40 The 200-UP-1/200-ZP-1 OUs waste streams have a makeup similar to the groundwater well results near 41 sources of B Plant liquid effluent disposal sites. These sites received and disposed of metal waste, 42 uranium recovery waste, and cesium and strontium scavenging waste which have infiltrated into the 43 aquifer. The highest ionic results are associated with nitrogen. The Basin 43 weighted average 44 concentration was 101 mg/L (nitrogen in nitrate) compared to 10 mg/L in the groundwater beneath LERF. 45 Some of the other waste streams (e.g., ERDF leachate and 200-BP-5 perched water) received at Basin 43 D-4

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 also exceeded regional background groundwater results for chloride, nitrogen, and sulfate, with 2 concentrations as great as 224 mg/L, 220 mg/L, and 597 mg/L, respectively (Table D-2). However, these 3 constituents are not likely to be distinguishable from current groundwater conditions beneath LERF, 4 mainly because of the concentration of these constituents in the groundwater at crossgradient/upgradient 5 locations to LERF, as discussed in Section D1.5.1. As also discussed in Section D1.5.1, as the 6 groundwater concentrations from the crossgradient/upgradient direction decrease, these constituents may 7 become more appropriate as indicator parameters at LERF. Because nitrate and sulfate may become more 8 appropriate indicator parameters in time, they will serve currently as groundwater quality parameters at 9 LERF monitoring wells. Because specific conductance is an indicator of nitrate and sulfate changes, 10 specific conductance will be added as an indicator parameter for documentation of the expected local 11 changes and comparison between the upgradient and downgradient monitoring wells. 12 None of the toxicity characteristic dangerous waste constituents received by Basin 43 exceed the toxicity 13 characteristics list threshold values (WAC 173-303-090(8)(c)). However, several of the potentially 14 dangerous waste metal constituent results for the basin were above groundwater background levels. 15 Even so, the results appear too low to determine should a potential release reach the aquifer because of 16 the scattering effect associated with infiltrating liquid waste effluents through the vadose zone into the 17 groundwater. However, it may be possible to differentiate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). 18 This constituent will need to be monitored semiannually for two years to develop a local background 19 basis before potentially adding it as an indicator parameter. Total chromium is not a reliable indicator 20 parameter because of the potential concentrations associated with casing corrosion. 21 Of the 49 volatile and semivolatile constituents, analyzed at various frequencies from 2008 to 2011 for 22 liquid wastes sent to Basin 43, only 3 (carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and trichloroethene) were 23 detectable. The most significant constituent was carbon tetrachloride, with concentrations ranging 24 between 190 and 800 gg/L. The other two constituents had concentrations less than 10 gg/L. Since carbon 25 tetrachloride is not normally occurring in the groundwater, it should be an excellent indicator parameter. 26 TOC ranged between 0.3 and 2.45 mg/L for liquid waste in Basin 43. The concentrations do not appear to 27 be significant enough to differentiate a groundwater quality impact should a release occur. TOC analyses 28 are subject to a wide range of variability and can lead to a false positive error. A more valid indicator of 29 carbon tetrachloride is TOX (Figures D-6 and D-7). Although not analyzed for in Table D-2, this 30 indicator parameter has a lower level of detection than TOC, and, as shown in Figures D-6 and D-7, 31 mimics the carbon tetrachloride level better than TOC. Thus, detection of both indicators (carbon 32 tetrachloride and TOX) would be conclusive of a dangerous waste constituent impact. As a result, TOX 33 and carbon tetrachloride will be added as indicator parameters for the LERF monitoring network. 34 D1.8 Basin 44 35 Basin 44 has received liquid waste dominated by ERDF leachate (7 million gal or 60 percent by volume). 36 Other liquid waste streams include K Basin waste (1.9 million gal or 16 percent by volume), leachate 37 from double-lined burial trenches, Mixed Waste Trenches 31 and 34 located in the 218-W-5 Burial 38 Ground (1.2 million gal or 10 percent by volume), and purge water from well development (1.1 million 39 gal or 10 percent by volume). The purge water and Mixed Waste Trenches 31 and 34 waste streams are 40 lower in all constituents as compared with ERDF leachate. Therefore, waste in Basin 44 is most similar to 41 the ERDF leachate because of volume and concentration. 42 ERDF waste streams are similar to groundwater well results downgradient from B Plant liquid effluent 43 disposal sites. The most comparable results are associated with chloride, nitrate, and sulfate. The average 44 concentrations were 250 mg/L, 327 mg/L, and 474 mg/L, respectively (Table D-3). However, these 45 constituents are not likely to be distinguishable from current groundwater conditions beneath LERF, 46 mainly because the concentration of these constituents are already present in the groundwater at similar D-5

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 concentrations both crossgradient and upgradient of LERF, as discussed in Section D1.5.1. As also 2 discussed in Section DI .5.1, as the groundwater concentrations from the crossgradient/upgradient 3 direction decrease, these constituents may become more appropriate as indicator parameters at LERF. 4 Because nitrate and sulfate may become more appropriate indicator parameters in time they will serve 5 currently as groundwater quality parameters at the LERF monitoring wells. Because specific conductance 6 is an indicator of nitrate and sulfate changes, specific conductance will be added as an indicator parameter 7 for documentation of the expected local changes and comparison between the upgradient and 8 downgradient monitoring wells. 9 None of the toxicity characteristic dangerous waste constituents received by LERF exceed the toxicity 10 characteristics list threshold values (WAC 173-303-090(8)(c)). Several of the potentially dangerous waste 11 metal constituents received at LERF were above groundwater background levels (Table D-3). 12 Nevertheless, the results would not show a measurable difference should a potential release to the aquifer 13 occur because of the low waste stream concentrations and the scattering effect associated with infiltrating 14 of liquid waste effluents through the vadose zone into the groundwater. 15 The organic chemical analytical results associated with Basin 44 were at very low levels (<5 jtg/L) and 16 were only periodically detected. Therefore, the ability to detect a potential release in the aquifer for 17 organic chemicals is not practicable for the same reason as discussed for the metals and anions. 18 TOC averaged 13.2 mg/L in Basin 44. TOC concentrations seem to be correlated with the elevated oil and 19 grease results. Because oil and grease are viscous, TOC does not appear to be a good indicator parameter. 20 The concentrations do not appear significant enough to be detectable in groundwater should a release 21 occur. As noted previously, TOC analyses are subject to a wide range of variability and can potentially 22 lead to a false positive error. 23 In conclusion, no reliable waste constituent indicator parameters are presently available for Basin 44 24 groundwater detection. 25 D1.9 Potential Contaminate Indicator Parameters in Groundwater 26 Based on the projected LERF influent waste streams and concentration levels from 2010 through 2028 as 27 presented in HNF-23142, there does not appear a significant change in waste streams expected. Thus, the 28 indicator parameters identified above appear to be sufficient for future detection monitoring at LERF. 29 From review of the waste stream characterization data for Basins 42, 43, and 44, one additional indicator 30 parameter (carbon tetrachloride) has been identified as a reliable indication of the presence of a potential 31 dangerous waste constituent release into the groundwater. Another potential indicator parameter may be 32 Cr(VI), based on local background results collected during 2014 through 2016. 33 D2 Hydrogeology and Groundwater-Chemistry 34 This section describes the geology, hydrogeology, and groundwater chemistry beneath the LERF area. 35 To date, seven wells have been installed for monitoring the groundwater quality beneath the LERF basins. 36 Table D-4 provides the well attributes for reference when reviewing this section. 37 D2.1 Geology 38 The geology near LERF consists of Columbia River Basalt overlain by a series of sedimentary units of 39 the Ringold Formation and Hanford formation. The interpretations are based on information from the 40 following sources: 41 * Miocene- to Pliocene-Aged Suprabasalt Sediments of the Hanford Site, South-Central Washington 42 (BHI-00184) D-6

The terrain surrounding the LERF basins is flat to slightly undulating, 19 and the average elevation is approximately 182 to 184 m (597 to 604 ft) above mean sea level. 20 The stratigraphy beneath LERF was interpreted from geologic observations during the drilling of seven 21 boreholes, select analyses of sediment samples, aquifer tests, and geophysical investigations over the past 22 two decades. The three principal stratigraphic units present near LERF, in ascending order, are the 23 Elephant Mountain Member of the Saddle Mountains Basalt (EMB), the Ringold Formation, and the 24 Hanford formation. The thickness of the suprabasalt sediments near the LERF basins ranges from 60 to 25 69 m (198 to 225 ft). 26 D2.1.1 Elephant Mountain Member 27 The nature and extent of the EMB, one of the youngest members of the Saddle Mountains Basalt and the 28 uppermost basalt in this area, is based on result of observations and documentation of archive samples 29 collected during drilling, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, seismic analyses, and hydraulic tests 30 performed within the upper basalt flow top. The EMB in this area was characterized in 31 WHC-SD-EN-EV-024 as consisting of only the oldest EMB flow (Elephant Mountain I). This flow is 32 generally continuous throughout the area, with a thickness ranging from approximately 12 m (39 ft) 33 where partially eroded, to greater than 35.1 m (115 ft) north of the 200 East Area. The EMB I flow 34 contains three intraflow structures: colonnade, entablature, and flow top. The colonnade makes up the 35 bottom third of the flow. The upper part of the colonnade grades from moderate- to well-developed 36 columns into a platy cross-fractured colonnade and then into a hackly entablature. The entablature has 37 numerous, irregular cross-fractures, vertical fractures, and small scattered vesicles near its top. The flow 38 top is characterized by abundant vesicles and is brecciated and/or palagonitic (WHC-SD-EN-EV-024). 39 Observations during drilling near the LERF basins, when initially encountering the EMB surface, were 40 described in WHC-MR-0235 as reddish weathered basalt with vesicles partially filled, except in D-7

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 wells 299-E26-9 and 299-E26-10, located to the west. However, well 299-E26-77, located next to 2 well 299-E26-9, was reported with heavy weathering and the presences of vesicles (SGW-41072). 3 The drilling rate was moderate through the upper EMB to a depth of 2 to 3 m (6.5 to 9.8 ft) when drilling 4 wells 299-E26-77 and 299-E26-79, respectively (SGW-39344). It was concluded in SGW-41072 that 5 hydraulic communication of the uppermost aquifer (e.g., unconfined) extends from the suprabasalt 6 sediments into the basalt, at least in the western half of LERF, because there was no impediment 7 associated with the overlying Hanford formation sediments. The thickness of the flow top was interpreted 8 to range from 2 m (6.5 ft) at well 299-E26-77 (west of LERF) to 3.2 m (10.5 ft) at well 299-E26-79 9 (south of LERF), and 1.5 m (5 ft) at well 299-E26-11 (east of LERF). 10 The EMB surface expression in the immediate vicinity of the LERF basins forms a depression centered at 11 the newest well 299-E26-14 (Figure D-3). The contours presented in Figure D-3 are based on a 12 combination of basalt contact during drilling and various geophysical investigations (e.g., seismic 13 reflection and refraction, electrical resistivity, and time-domain electromagnetic sounding). Seismic 14 results to the east and west of well 299-E26-14 portray limited aquifer conditions above the basalt 15 (Figure D-8). Paleochannels are interpreted to the north and northwest of well 299-E26-14 and continued 16 to the south-southeast, as displayed in Figures D-3 and D-9. Seismic reflection results suggest an even 17 deeper depression to the east of well 299-E26-79, centered almost directly south of Basin 43, with as 18 much as 8 m (26 ft) of aquifer thickness (Figure D-10, black line in figure provides the interpreted top of 19 basalt). Continuing east of this depression to the south of LERF, the basalt surface is interpreted to rise to 20 the current water table level. The apparent contact with the water table is estimated to be just south of the 21 west boundary of Basin 44. Further east, the basalt is interpreted to plateau beyond well 299-E26-1 1. West 22 of well 299-E26-79, the basalt surface is interpreted to increase in elevation linearly to the elevation of 23 121.3 m (398 ft) at well 299-E26-10. Finally, Figure D-1 1 provides an angle view of the well casing 24 extensions from ground surface to basalt in the LERF area and to the west/northwest, including remnant 25 Ringold Unit A sediments and groundwater extent above basalt. The depiction of the groundwater implies 26 flow through the basalt flow top as discussed further in Section D2.2. Figure D-12 provides an 27 interpretation of the basalt surface and Ringold sediments without the groundwater overlay. 28 D2.1.2 Ringold Formation 29 The Ringold Formation represents ancient fluvial and lacustrine deposits associated with the ancestral 30 Columbia River, and the formation exhibits consolidation and weathering. Where present, this Formation 31 overlies the EMB (Figure D-12). According to WHC-SD-EN-EV-024, remnant muds associated with the 32 Ringold period exist to the east and northwest of the LERF site at wells 299-E26-1 1 and 299-E35-2, 33 respectively. 200 East Groundwater Aggregate Area Management Study Report (DOE/RL-92-19) 34 reported approximately 2.74 m (9 ft) of the Ringold Lower Mud Unit in well 299-E26-11 and mapped the 35 Lower Mud Unit extending to this location from the east. BHI-00 184 identified the Ringold muds east of 36 the 200 East Area as paleosol-overbank deposits. WHC-SD-EN-EV-024 concluded that the sediment 37 layer was a paleosol based on XRF analysis. BHI-00 184 states that pedogenically altered silt- and 38 clay-rich overbank-paleosol (facies association III) deposits of the Ringold Formation are easily 39 distinguished from the basalt-rich sand and gravel of the Hanford formation. In 2000, PNNL-12261 40 defined the sediments near well 299-E26-11 hydraulically as the Ringold Formation Unit A and, more 41 specifically, the hydrogeologic unit 9C (Figure D-12). 42 The Ringold sediment at well 299-E26-1 1, as described in WHC-MR-0235, consists of a slightly gravelly 43 sandy mud (5 percent gravel, 30 percent sand, and 65 percent mud). The color was reported as very dark 44 grayish brown (1OYR3/2). The gravel content was described as 90 percent mafic, and the sand content 45 was 50 percent mafic. The sediments had no reaction to hydrochloric acid. D-8

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 During drilling of the new well 299-E26-14, low permeability sediments were encountered at 65.5 to 66.1 m 2 (215.5 to 217 ft) below ground surface (bgs). The sediments were described as 95 percent silt and 5 percent 3 gravel. Photographic review of this sediment layer, presented in SGW-51467, showed a distinct texture 4 and color change from the overlying Hanford sandy gravels. The reddish brown hue and yellow tints 5 associated with this layer correlate well with the distal overbank description provided in BHI-00 184. 6 Other characteristics associated with this layer included no reaction to hydrochloric, similar to Ringold 7 sediments described at well 299-E26-1 1. An alternative explanation may be that the apparent Ringold 8 sediments are rework, removed from one location and deposited at this location, possibly associated with 9 cataclysmic glacial fluvial floods. 10 Most of the area beneath LERF is considered devoid of Ringold sediments because of the high energy 11 scouring associated glacial fluvial flooding in the Pleistocene and the lack of reflectors in the suprabasalt 12 section during 2011 seismic data reviews. PNNL-19702 presents a conceptual model of various 13 paleochannels originating to the northwest (Figure D-9). Some of these paleochannels may have been 14 formed during Ringold times, and isolated remnants of Ringold sediments are sometimes found within 15 these older paleochannels. 16 D2.1.3 Hanford Formation 17 The Hanford formation near LERF ranges in thickness from approximately 59 to 66 m (193 to 215 ft) or 18 more (Figures D-13 and D-14). The texture of the Hanford formation is loose to weakly cemented, sandy, 19 pebble-cobble gravels to gravelly sand, with occasional layers of sand and/or muddy sand. Regionally, the 20 Hanford formation is subdivided into an upper gravel sequence (HI), a sandy sequence (H2), and a lower 21 gravel sequence (H3). The sandy sequence is present locally and, where it is missing, a single sequence of 22 gravel-dominated facies exists, which is undifferentiated in cross-sections. 23 LERF is located along the southern flank of a major west-northwest/east-southeast trending cataclysmic 24 flood channel. Because of multiple flood events and the turbulence and extremely high energy associated 25 with these floods, it is difficult to correlate individual strata within flood sequences. In outcrops of the 26 Hanford formation elsewhere in the Pasco Basin, for example, it is common to see changes from 27 gravel-dominated sediments to sand and silt-dominated sediments over a distance of a few tens of meters. 28 In general, more silt or mud was present to the west and east than north or south of the LERF basins 29 based on geologic logs for the seven wells drilled within the LERF vicinity. However, high silt and clay 30 content to the north and south of LERF is present near the contact with the EMB within the aquifer. 31 These silt and clay layers ranged in thickness between 0.3 to 1.5 m (1 to 5 ft) and appear to be of Ringold 32 age as discussed in D.2.1.2. The basalt content in layers above the silt and clay indicates Hanford origin. 33 Above these initial layers, the gravel content was generally about 60 percent, consisting of 40 to 70 34 percent mafics. Significantly more cobbles were described in the north and south boreholes than to the 35 east and west throughout the borehole log descriptions. The grayish brown to very dark grayish brown 36 color description of the sediments was consistent throughout the area. Calcium carbonate levels are low to 37 within 21 m (70 ft) of ground surface, based on little to no reaction to hydrochloric acid. The upper zone 38 with increased calcium carbonate levels correlates with low modeled velocities during refraction and 39 resistivity modeling, as stated in SGW-52467, and may be a distinctive feature to differentiate the H1 and 40 H3 in this area. Moisture observations ranged from dry to wet; however, the damp and wet descriptions in 41 the vadose zone pertained to zones where water was added during drilling. In conclusion, based on the 42 larger gravel content and size to the north and south of the LERF basins, the dominant flow during 43 deposition appears to be from the northwest, aligning with the conceptual model in PNNL-19702 44 (Figure D-9). In addition, there were no significant zones of silt or clay above the aquifer indicating no 45 perching horizons in the suprabasalt sediments beneath the LERF vicinity. D-9

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 D2.2 Groundwater Hydrology 2 The vadose zone beneath LERF consists of the Hanford formation and portions of the EMB above the 3 water table, as well as potentially some of the Ringold Formation near well 299-E26-1 1. There have been 4 no observations indicating perched water table conditions near the LERF basins; however, perched 5 conditions could be present west and northwest of the westernmost LERF monitoring wells. 6 The uppermost aquifer directly beneath LERF is thin to moderate in thickness (e.g., ranging from 7 possibly not present to greater than 8 m (26.25 ft) and exists in the Hanford and EMB flow top 8 (Figures D-13 and D-14). This aquifer is unconfined, except to the east where barometric analyses within 9 well 299-E26-1 1 indicate semiconfined conditions. This is consistent with the rise in groundwater elevation 10 when drilling advanced through the lower Ringold sediments, present at this well, causing the groundwater 11 elevation to rise nearly 3.1 m (10 ft) in the temporary casing (WHC-MR-0235). The westward extent of 12 the Ringold sediments is uncertain; however, it has been portrayed to pinch out west of well 299-E26-11 13 (Figure D-12). Although well 299-E26-11 is still capable of yielding representative samples from the 14 same hydrostratigraphic unit as the other LERF wells, the chemical nature of the samples is different and 15 has been more characteristic of groundwater to the east of LERF. 16 Well construction details are discussed in Section D2.4 and presented in Table D-4. To date, seven wells 17 have been installed for detection monitoring since 1990. Three of the wells (299-E26-11, 299-E26-77, 18 and 299-E26-79) were screened either entirely or primarily within the EMB flow top. The wells produce 19 at a minimum 22.7 L/min (6 gal/min), which is sufficient for groundwater sampling, and the flow top is 20 sufficiently permeable for adequate hydraulic connection with the overlying sediments. 21 Basalt flow top fracturing, brecciation, and/or weathering provide localized zones of higher permeability. 22 Where these conditions exist and are in hydraulic communication with overlying saturated sediments, the 23 basalt flow top is part of the overlying unconfined aquifer system. Based on evaluations of drill cuttings, 24 drilling rates, and water production noted during drilling wells 299-E26-77 and 299-E26-79, the EMB 25 flow top functions as a component of the unconfined aquifer and forms a laterally continuous aquifer 26 beneath LERF. 27 The uppermost aquifer is thickest north of Basin 42 and appears to thicken south of Basin 43 28 (Figures D-8, D-10, D-13, and D-14) due to paleochannel development. The flow interior of the EMB 29 represents the lower boundary of the uppermost aquifer. This was verified by observations during drilling 30 at wells 299-E26-77 and 299-E26-79, as discussed in Section D2. 1.1. 31 D2.2.1 Aquifer Properties 32 Hydraulic tests were conducted in 1990, 2003, 2008, and 2011 to derive representative hydraulic 33 parameters for the various saturated formations beneath the LERF general vicinity. Slug tests were 34 completed for each of the seven wells with a derived hydraulic conductivity value. The 1990 slug tests 35 were completed in wells 299-E26-9, 299-E26-10, 299-E26-1 1, and 299-E35-2, which were constructed 36 with a 10.2 cm (4 in.) diameter wire wrapped screen and 0.25 mm (0.0 10 in.) slot width. A 20-40 silica 37 sand filter pack encases the screen interval. The following paragraphs summarize the results for each 38 well, and WHC-SD-EN-EV-024 provides further detailed discussion. The 2003 hydraulic tests were 39 completed at wells 299-E26-10 and 299-E26-1 1 and consisted of slug tests at each well and the following 40 additional tests at well 299-E26-1 0: tracer test, tracer-pumpback test, and constant-rate pumping test. 41 This subsection summarizes the results for each well, and PNNL- 14804, Results ofDetailed Hydrologic 42 Characterization Tests Fiscal Year 2003, provides further discussion. The 2008 hydraulic slug tests were 43 completed at wells 299-E26-77 and 299-E26-79, constructed with a 10.2 cm (4 in.) diameter wire 44 wrapped screens and 0.5 mm (0.020 in.) slot width. A 10-20 silica sand filter pack encases the screen 45 interval. A slug test at well 299-E26-1 1 also was included in 2008. This subsection summarizes the 2008 D-1 0

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART Ill, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 results for each well, and SGW-41072 provides further discussion. Finally, a 2011 constant rate pumping 2 test was completed at well 299-E26-14, which was constructed with 10.2 cm (4 in.) diameter wire wrapped 3 screens and 0.5 mm (0.020 in.) slot width. A 10-20 silica sand filter pack encases the screen interval. 4 Because several of the well screens cross various formations, a summary of the screen interval is provided 5 in the following text and in Table D-4. When heterogeneous conditions exist, the hydraulic results are an 6 arithmetic average of the individual formational layers based on a weighted-thickness (PNNL-14804). 7 Well 299-E26-9 (now sample dry) was screened only in the Hanford formation. The 1990 slug test 8 derived transmissivity values for well 299-E26-9 ranged from 11 to 230 m2/day (118 to 2,476 ft2/day). 9 The derived hydraulic conductivity ranged between approximately 6 to 120 m/day (20 to 394 ft/day), 10 assuming an aquifer thickness of 2 m (6.6 ft). 11 Well 299-E26-10 is screened primarily across the Hanford formation with a small section across the EMB 12 flow top (0.5 m [1.6 ft]). Transmissivity values for well 299-E26-10 were not derived for the 1990 tests 13 because of the fast recovery response (e.g., less than 3 seconds). In 2003, four hydraulic slug tests, two 14 low and two high stress, were performed at well 299-E26-10. The results produced a hydraulic 15 conductivity range, based on the Kansas Geological Survey (KGS) type-curve method, of 36.7 to 16 42.8 m/day for both stress-level tests (KGS, 1991, Seismic-Reflection Processing Demonstration Using 17 Eavesdropper). The KGS type-curve method was used to derive the hydraulic conductivity as explained 18 in PNNL-14804. The 2003 screened thickness across the saturated Hanford formation was 1.48 m 19 (4.85 ft). Four additional hydraulic tests were completed at this well in 2003. The tracer-dilution test 20 provided qualitative evidence that the overlying Hanford formation sediments had a considerably higher 21 hydraulic conductivity than the EMB flow top. The tracer-pumpback test was used to derive the effective 22 porosity; however, due to test complexities, the calculation did not appear representative of the aquifer 23 conditions. The constant-rate pumping test provided another means of deriving the hydraulic 24 conductivity, which was reported at 36.2 m/d with a transmissivity of 71.6 m2/day. Based on the 25 consistency of the 2003 results, the hydraulic conductivity ranges between 36.2 and 42.8 m/day. 26 Well 299-E26-11 is screened only across the EMB flow top. The 1990-derived transmissivity value for 27 well 299-E26-l 1 was 6.1 m2/d (20 ft2/d) with a hydraulic conductivity of 11.2 m/day (120 ft/day). 28 Five additional hydraulic slug tests were completed at well 299-E26-11 in 2003, which derived a range of 29 hydraulic conductivity values from 5.85 to 6.8 m/day. Four additional slug tests were performed in 2008 30 producing a reported hydraulic conductivity value of 10 m/day. The hydraulic conductivity values for the 31 three times range from 5.85 to 11.2 m/day. Because of the analysis methods used by PNNL-14804, the 32 most representative value appears to be 6.3 m/day. 33 Well 299-E26-14 was completed in 2011 with 5.5 m (18 ft) of screen across the Ringold and Hanford 34 sediments. Only a small portion (0.27 m or 0.9 ft) of the Ringold sediments are adjacent to the bottom of 35 the well screen. A 27.3 gal/min constant pump test was completed on November 26, 2011. A transducer 36 was installed to collect changing water table elevations during the 75 minute pumping test. In total, 2,048 37 gal were pumped during the test, as described in the field activity log. Because no hydraulic parameters 38 were calculated from the field activity records, type-curve matching methods were used to derive 39 transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity results for this well. The computer program AQTESOLV was 40 used for curve matching. AQTESOLV uses a nonlinear least squares procedure to match a type-curve or 41 straight-line solution for the data provided. Through a sequence of iterations, the procedure systematically 42 adjusts the values of hydraulic properties to achieve the best statistical match between a solution 43 (type-curve) and the test data. Each iteration seeks to minimize the sum of squared residuals. 44 AQTESOLV provides five different solution methods for unconfined aquifer pumping tests. Initially, the 45 Theis and Cooper-Jacob methods were evaluated against the field data, but the curve matching associated 46 with these solution methods did not align (Theis, 1935, "The Relation Between the Lowering of the D-11

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 Piezometric Surface and the Rate and Duration of Discharge of a Well Using Ground-Water Storage;" 2 Cooper and Jacob, 1946, "A Generalized Graphical Method of Evaluating Formation Constants and 3 Summarizing Well-Field History"). The Moench method provides independent parameters for wellbore 4 storage, wellbore skin, and delayed gravity response in anisotropic unconfined aquifers (Moench, 1997, 5 "Flow to a well of finite diameter in a homogeneous, anisotropic water table aquifer"). After manual 6 manipulation of the independent parameter for the wellbore skin factor and delayed drainage parameter, 7 the Moench derived curve nearly matched the field results as provided in Figure D-15. The derived 8 hydraulic conductivity from this curve matching solution was 27.3 m/d. Another solution method, 9 Neuman, with less independent parameters for manipulation, produced the type-curve in Figure D- 16 10 (Neuman, 1974, "Effect of Partial Penetration on Flow in Unconfined Aquifers Considering Delayed 11 Gravity Response"). The derived hydraulic conductivity from this curve matching solution was 24.4 12 m/day. These results agree with the slug results derived for the other wells in the LERF vicinity. The best 13 estimate is considered 27.3 m/day. 14 Well 299-E26-77 was completed in 2008 with 6.1 m (20.1 ft) of screen across the EMB flow top and 15 0.71 m (2.3 ft) across the overlying silty sandy gravel Hanford formation. The 2008 derived hydraulic 16 conductivity was reported in SGW-41072 at several tens of meters/day. Because there were no specific 17 values presented in this report, the data from the two slug withdraw tests were retrieved and reanalyzed 18 with type-curve methods, as discussed in PNNL-14804. Briefly, the type-curve method is useful for 19 analyzing unconfined aquifer conditions because it uses all or any part of the slug test response. 20 The computer program AQTESOLV was used for curve matching, as discussed previously. 21 The automated matching option with default setting was applied to the KGS Model, KGS model with skin 22 effects, and the Springer-Gelhar inertial effects method (Water-Resources Investigation Report 91-4034, 23 U.S. Geological Survey Toxic Substances Hydrology Program-Proceedings of the technical meeting, 24 Monterey, California, March 11-15, 1991). The most comparable slug test derived curve was the 25 Springer-Gelhar eritically dampened method. This method nearly matched the second slug withdraw 26 results, as shown in Figure D-17. One of the assumptions for this type-curve is a quasi steady-state of the 27 aquifer. A quasi steady-state flow neglects specific storage, unlike the Cooper-Bredehoeft-Papadopulos 28 method (Cooper et al., 1967, "Response of a Finite-Diameter Well to an Instantaneous Charge of Water"). 29 When the Cooper-Bredehoeft-Papadopulos method was run, it did not converge with the test data, 30 indicating the aquifer conditions are more suitable for the Springer-Gelhar method. In addition, the 31 Barker-Black fractured aquifer solution method failed to converge (Barker and Black, 1983, "Slug Test in 32 Fissured Aquifers"). The Springer-Gelhar results derived a hydraulic conductivity of 134 m/d. For 33 comparison, three additional methods (Bouwer-Rice, Hvorslev, and Barker-Black double porosity 34 fractured aquifer method) also were analyzed; however, the curve-type matching alignment with the data 35 was either significantly different and did not converge or only visually applied to the later recovering slug 36 test results using line-matching, which produced much greater hydraulic conductivity results (Bouwer and 37 Rice, 1976, "A Slug Test for Determining Hydraulic Conductivity of Unconfined Aquifers With 38 Completely or Partially Penetrating Wells;" Hvorslev, 1951, Time Lag and Soil Permeability in 39 Ground- Water Observations). As discussed in PNNL-14804, the semi-empirical nature of the Bouwer 40 and Rice method for complex well/aquifer conditions can lead to declining levels of accuracy beyond 41 30 percent. Thus, the best estimate of the hydraulic conductivity for well 299-E26-77 is 134 m/d using the 42 Springer-Gelhar solution. Because hydraulic conductivity results from other tests in the area produce 43 much lower results for the Hanford formation, the fractured flow top appears to be the dominant flow 44 regime at this well. If the fractured flow top is thinner and the borehole diameter within the basalt is 45 smaller, the hydraulic conductivity value would be even higher. Conversely, if the flow top is thicker and 46 the borehole diameter is larger, the hydraulic conductivity value would be smaller. D-12

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 Well 299-E26-79 was completed in 2008 with 4 m (13.2 ft) of screen across the EMB flow top and 2.7 m 2 (8.9 ft) across the overlying Ringold and Hanford sediments. The 2008 derived hydraulic conductivity 3 was reported in SGW-41072 at several tens of meters/day. Because there were no specific values 4 presented in this report, the two slug withdraw test data were retrieved and reanalyzed with type-curve 5 methods, as discussed previously for well 299-E26-77. The early slug test data could not be fit by any of 6 the AQTESOLV solution methods. Fitting the remaining portion of the data produced significantly larger 7 hydraulic conductivity results by one to two orders of magnitude than at well 299-E26-77. Because the 8 results are not consistent with the other LERF well results, the data do not appear to be useable; therefore, 9 no hydraulic conductivity results were generated for this well. 10 Well 299-E35-2 (now sample dry) was screened mainly across the sediments above the EMB flow top 11 (1.9 m [6.2 ft]) with a portion of the screen across the EMB flow top (0.4 m [1.3 ft]). The 1990 derived 12 transmissivity value for well 299-E35-2 was 6 m2/day (20 ft2/day), with a hydraulic conductivity of 39.7 13 m/day (130 ft/day). 14 In summary, the multiple slug test results at six of the seven wells described in this subsection adequately 15 define the hydraulic conductivity for the basalt flow top and Hanford sediments. The basalt flow top slug 16 test data produced varying results of hydraulic conductivity. To the east, the results were low, while 17 results to the south and west of LERF were significantly greater than the overlying Ringold and Hanford 18 sediment results. The range of hydraulic conductivity beneath and west of LERF appears to exceed 19 100 m/day. A best estimate is 134 m/day. The overlying suprabasalt sediments were consistent with a 20 hydraulic conductivity range of 24.4 to 42.8 m/day, with a best estimate of 39.5 m/day. These values will 21 be used to derive the rate of flow for LERF. Although effective porosity was not derived from tests 22 completed at LERF, the effective porosity to be used for flow rate calculations at LERF is 0.1. This value 23 was chosen because of the evaluation process discussed in SGW-54508, WMA C September 2012 24 Quarterly Groundwater Monitoring Report. 25 D2.2.2 Flow Dynamics 26 Regional groundwater flow was initially from west to east but was impacted by groundwater mounding 27 resulting from wastewater discharges primarily to the east. These impacts have diminished significantly 28 and do not appear to contribute to the flow regime beneath LERF; however, they still appear to affect the 29 groundwater quality at well 299-E26-1 1. 30 Recently, statistical methods have been applied to deriving the flow direction. Table D-5 provides the 31 gradient and magnitude associated with the statistically corrected calculations since the installation and 32 water level collection at well 299-E26-14. Although the p-value indicates the derived values have a 33 moderate amount of uncertainty (e.g., 20 to 30 percent), the direction has been very constant ranging 34 between 186 and 198 degrees from north (e.g., southwest of south flow). The average direction is 35 190 degrees from north. In addition, the gradient magnitude has been constant, ranging between 2.39E-04 36 and 2.98E-04, with an average of 2.7E-4. If these average values are applied to the following formula 37 V=(K*G)/nk (Driscoll, 1986, Groundwater and Wells); where V is the flow rate, K is the hydraulic 38 conductivity, G is the gradient, and n, is the effective porosity, then the average flow rate in the 39 suprabasalt sediments could be 0.11 m/day or 38.9 m/year. This value correlates with the movement of a 40 sulfate plume originating to the northwest and west of LERF, as explained in Section 2.10.3.6 and displayed 41 in Figure 2.10-42 of DOE/RL-2008-01, Hanford Site Groundwater Monitoring for Fiscal Year 2007. 42 Although the derived gradient magnitude and associated flow rate beneath LERF is consistent with other 43 observances of migrating plume rates, as discussed in the previous paragraph, the 190 degree flow 44 direction and increasing anion and cation concentrations at well 299-E26-14 (Figure D-18) do not 45 correlate with the perceived source of anion and cation increases. One of the most distinguishable D-13

--- Page 955 ---
DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 constituents associated with the anion and cation increases is sulfate. Sulfate was initially observed 2 increasing at significant levels at well 299-E34-7, located northwest of LERF, in the mid-1990s, as shown 3 in Figure D-19. This well became sample dry in 2005, two years after concentrations had peaked at 4 671 mg/L. The extent and source of the sulfate is uncertain; however, various conceptual models have 5 been discussed to a limited degree. Movement of the sulfate also has been discussed in several of the 6 Hanford Site Groundwater Monitoring Reports over the past two decades, and an interpreted snapshot of 7 the sulfate plume is provided for 2008 and 2013 (Figure D-20). Historically, sulfate increases along the 8 west side of the LERF monitoring network appear to be associated with transverse dispersivity because of 9 the lack of vadose zone moisture during drilling well 299-E26-77, the derived southward flow direction 10 from monitoring network, and smaller slope of sulfate increase at well 299-E26- 10 than at well 11 299-E34-7 (Figure D-19). 12 More recently, the rate and direction of groundwater flow appear to be in a state of change regionally. 13 Sulfate concentrations leveled off between 2009 and 2011 near LERF, when the regional flow conditions 14 were considered to be at a minimum compared to previous years (Figure D-18). Since the middle of 2011, 15 when the Columbia River elevation began to exceed the 200 East groundwater elevations, concentrations 16 have been increasing at a greater rate in wells farther east than at well 299-E26-10 (Figure D-18). 17 Three explanations are provided for what may be occurring: 18 * The northwest sulfate source may be diminishing and because well 299-E26-10 is spatially closer to 19 the source, it is beginning to decrease with the decreasing front, while wells 299-E26-14 and 20 299-E26-79, farther spatially from the proposed northwest source, are still within the increasing front 21 of the sulfate plume. 22 * The flow direction has shifted to a southeast of east to an easterly flow direction, causing greater 23 concentrations to migrate preferentially toward wells 299-E26-14 and 299-E26-79. 24 * The source of sulfate increases may be from a more regional source as sulfate increases have also 25 been seen at well 299-E26-1 1, but to a smaller degree, and delayed compared to well 299-E26-10 26 (Figure D-2 1). 27 Because of the consistent flow direction derived by the current monitoring network and the larger 28 influence of sulfate increases seen across the LERF monitoring network, the sulfate increases are 29 considered to be from a larger regional source. As such, well 299-E26-14 provides a sufficient 30 representation of the groundwater quality migrating into the area from the north. However, to ensure that 31 conditions continue to reflect this conceptual flow model, well 299-E26-77 will be monitored but 32 considered a crossgradient monitoring well and not included in upgradient statistical measurements. 33 Water levels will continue to be collected at wells 299-E26-10 and 299-E26-77 to maintain statistical 34 analyses of the flow direction. Should conditions change in the statistically derived flow direction or 35 groundwater quality parameters at well 299-E26-77 suggest a change in sulfate migration, then the 36 information will be relayed in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) quarterly 37 report with a proposed action. 38 Based on the accepted southward flow direction, well 299-E26-79 is the only downgradient well currently 39 at LERF. Because the basalt flow top appears to be connected hydraulically to the suprabasalt sediments 40 and provides a potentially more transmissive pathway, well 299-E26-79 does not appear to be sufficiently 41 located to monitor the easternmost basin. 42 D2.3 Groundwater Chemistry 43 Groundwater chemistry in the uppermost aquifer beneath LERF was affected by several years of diluted 44 liquid waste discharge to the 216-B-3 Pond System, which ceased in 1997. Figure D-22 provides an D-14

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 illustration of the groundwater chemical facies at various LERF wells from the early 1990s to 2013 using 2 Stiff Diagrams. As can be seen in the figure during the early to mid-1990s, the groundwater chemical 3 facies was calcium-bicarbonate, except to the west of LERF where a calcium-bicarbonate-sulfate facies 4 was present at well 299-E34-7. By 1999, the groundwater at well 299-E34-7 was a strong calcium-sulfate 5 facies, and well 299-E26-10, located to the southeast of well 299-E34-7, was changing to a 6 calcium-sulfate facies. In 2001, well 299-E26-10 was a calcium-sulfate facies. 7 In 2006, well 299-E26-1 1, located to the east of LERF, was beginning to show signs of changing from a 8 calcium-bicarbonate facies. By 2011, well 299-E26-11 also had changed to a calcium-sulfate facies. 9 Although well 299-E26-11 saw a change in the chemical nature of the groundwater after wells to the 10 west, it has had a greater water elevation than the wells to the west. This indicates the water facies change 11 must be from north of well 299-E26-1 1. Further east at well 699-45-42, located east of well 299-E26-11, 12 a calcium-bicarbonate chemical facies was still present in 2012. 13 The wells to the north and south of LERF portray an intermediate chemical facies, which is between the 14 strong calcium-sulfate facies to the west and the more dilute calcium-sulfate facies to the east. 15 For comparison, the calcium and sulfate milliequivalents in well 299-E26-10 in January of 2013 were 16 6.4 to 5.5, respectively. The milliequivalents at well 299-E26-11 in January 2013 were 2.6 for both 17 calcium and sulfate. The January 2013 milliequivalent results for wells 299-E26-14 and 299-E26-79 were 18 3.9 to 3.3 and 3.7 to 3.0, respectively. Thus, the chemical facies is slightly stronger to the north of LERF 19 than south, which is downgradient of LERF. 20 The fact that all the wells near LERF are showing chemical facies changes to a calcium-sulfate indicates 21 that the wells are hydraulically connected and that there is a sulfate source to the north of LERF. 22 Water quality parameters will continue to be collected semiannually for purposes of further evaluation, as 23 shown in Table D-6. 24 D2.4 Well Completions and Conditions 25 The basic well information is summarized in Table D-4 and in Figures D-23 through D-27. Five wells are 26 provided for discussions related to the geology and hydrogeology; however, only four of the wells 27 (299-E26-10, 299-E26-14, 299-E26-77, and 299-E26-79) are being used for monitoring the groundwater 28 near LERF. The four wells allow use of statistical measures to derive a groundwater gradient and direction. 29 All four wells extend beyond 61 m (200 ft) in depth. Although the new wells extend 5.5 to 6.1 m 30 (18 to 20 ft) into the EMB, the screened intervals in all four wells intercept the unconfined aquifer as 31 discussed in Section D2.2.1. 32 The initial LERF groundwater monitoring wells were installed in 1990 and included three downgradient 33 wells on the west end of the facility boundary and one upgradient well at the east end of the facility. This 34 configuration was based on the east-to-west groundwater flow direction, caused by the recharge mound 35 created by years of liquid effluent disposal to B Pond. Wells 299-E26-9, 299-E26-10, and 299-E35-2 36 were originally installed as downgradient wells and well 299-E26-11 as an upgradient well. Wells 37 299-E26-77 and 299-E26-79 were installed in 2008. Well 299-E26-77 is adjacent to the location of well 38 299-E26-9, and well 299-E26-79 is south of LERF between Basins 42 and 43 (Figure D-2). Well 39 299-E26-10 (Figure D-23) has a 4.5 m (15 ft) screen, screening across the entire saturated suprabasalt 40 sediments. The well screen in 299-E26-10 penetrates approximately 0.5 m (1.8 ft) into the basalt. Well 41 299-E26-1 1 (Figure D-3 and D.24) was completed with a 1.5 m (5 ft) long channel-pack screen placed 42 completely within the basalt flow top and includes a sand pack that extends 1.3 m (4.4 ft) above the 43 screen top.

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 Well 299-E26-14 encountered groundwater at approximately 60.5 m (198.4 ft) bgs and was drilled to a 2 total depth of 73.3 m (240.6 ft) bgs (Figure D-25). The well is constructed with 6.1 m (20 ft) total length 3 of screen installed across approximately 5.5 m (18 ft) of Ringold and Hanford sediments. Only a small 4 portion (0.27 m or 0.9 ft) of the Ringold sediments are adjacent the bottom of the well screen. The screen 5 is 10 cm (4 in.) in diameter, 20 slot, stainless-steel wire-wrap. The well has a 1 m (3 ft) blank sump below 6 the screen. The casing from the top of the screen to land surface is 10 cm (4 in.) diameter stainless steel. 7 Well 299-E26-77 encountered groundwater at approximately 63.4 m (208 ft) bgs and was drilled to a total 8 depth of 71 m (232.8 ft) bgs (Figure D-26). The well is constructed with 7.6 m (25 ft) total length of screen 9 installed across approximately 1.4 m (4.6 ft) of sediments and 6.2 m (21.4 ft) of basalt flow top. Well 10 299-E26-79 encountered groundwater at 61.5 m (201.7 ft) bgs and was drilled to a total depth of 68.5 m 11 (224.8 ft) bgs (Figure D-27). The well is constructed with 7.6 m (25 ft) total length of screen installed across 12 approximately 3.7 m (12 ft) of sediments and 3.9 m (13 ft) of basalt flow top. The screens are 10 cm (4 in.) 13 in diameter, 20-slot, stainless-steel wire-wrap. Both wells have a 1 m (3 ft) blank sump below the screens. 14 The casing from the top of the screen to land surface is 10 cm (4 in.) diameter stainless steel. 15 The longevity of the operable monitoring lifetime for the remaining LERF wells is not a concern as water 16 levels are only being collected from well 299-E26-10 and, based on recent water level declines, should be 17 useable for decades. The other three wells have significant water for sample collection and should not go 18 dry, based on pre-Hanford groundwater elevations. 19 D3 Groundwater-Monitoring Program 20 Groundwater monitoring at LERF is in detection monitoring and the indicator parameters are discussed 21 further in Section D3.6.1. The indicator parameters were derived as summarized in Section D3.2 and 22 discussed in further detail in Section DI.5. The detection monitoring sample frequency is semiannual as 23 discussed in Section D3.6.2. Sampling irocedures and required documentation is provided in Sections 24 D3.6.3 and D3.6.4, respectively. The analytical procedures, analytical quality control (QC), data 25 management are discussed in Sections D3.9, D3.9.1, and D3.9.2, respectively. 26 Statistical methods are employed to determine local background conditions for the upgradient well 27 299-E26-14 as provided in Section D3.9.3. Detection monitoring at LERF is discussed in Section D3.4. 28 Should indicator parameter results exceed local background levels then resampling will be implemented 29 for determining if a false positive result has occurred or if assessment monitoring must be undertaken as 30 discussed in Sections D3.3, D3.9.3, and D3.1 1. 31 Reporting will be annually through the Hanford Site Annual Groundwater Monitoring Report unless a 32 significant exceedance of the background values determined for the upgradient well 299-E26-14 is 33 verified. If an exceedance is verified then the notification process discussed in Section D3.11 will be 34 followed. 35 As discussed in Sections Dl and D2 and their subsections, the following characteristics describe the 36 hydrogeology in the LERF area: 37 * Representative groundwater samples can be collected from the uppermost aquifer. 38 * Upgradient background samples at well 299-E26-14 are representative of unaffected groundwater 39 from LERF. 40 * Groundwater samples collected at well 299-E26-79 are representative of the quality of groundwater 41 passing the LERF point of compliances.

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 Hydraulic characterization tests conducted over the past two decades and the groundwater chemical facies 2 changes indicate the hydrostratigraphic units underlying the LERF basins constitute an aquifer unit that is 3 continuous beneath the LERF basins and is capable of yielding representative groundwater samples. 4 D3.1 Objectives of Dangerous Waste Groundwater Monitoring and Past Monitoring Results 5 A groundwater monitoring program, in accordance with the requirements of WAC 173-303-645, is 6 designed to determine whether there is statistically significant evidence of contamination in the 7 uppermost aquifer attributable to the LERF basins. The statistical parametric t-test approach at LERF 8 compares two distinct statistical populations for true differences in population means as discussed further 9 in Section D3.9.3. 10 By the date of this permit, the action leakage rate has not been exceeded during operations, and results of 11 the LERF groundwater monitoring program indicate the LERF basins have not impacted groundwater 12 quality beneath the site. Past monitoring results from former downgradient wells 299-E26-10 and 13 299-E26-1 1, and more recent results from newer wells 299-E26-77 and 299-E26-79, have not indicated 14 dangerous constituents above background levels, with the exception of one positive carbon tetrachloride 15 result at each well. Because the detections were followed by a series of non-detect values and the results 16 were associated with out-of-limit QC samples, the reported concentrations appeared to be associated with 17 a laboratory error and were flagged as suspect. As a result, a detection monitoring program in accordance 18 with WAC 173-303-645(9) is appropriate for the site to provide compliance with the requirements of 19 WAC 173-303-645. 20 D3.2 Dangerous Constituents 21 A list of dangerous and/or mixed aqueous waste that can be accepted in LERF is defined by the 22 requirements of Addendum B (Waste Analysis Plan). 23 Dangerous constituents and suitable indicator parameters that provide a reliable indication of the presence 24 of dangerous constituents in groundwater for purposes of groundwater monitoring were based on target 25 parameter constituents from Addendum B (Waste Analysis Plan), and results of LERF basin water 26 samples collected between July 1999 and June 2013. Several target parameters in the Waste Analysis Plan 27 (Addendum B) occur in the LERF basin influent data and were evaluated relative to the dangerous waste 28 characteristics (groundwater monitoring list in WAC 173-303-090, "Dangerous Waste Characteristics," 29 and Ecology Publication 97-407, Chemical Testing Methods for Designating Dangerous Waste: 30 WAC 173-303-090 & -100, Appendix 5. As discussed in Section D1.5, dangerous waste constituents 31 measured as part of routine liquid sampling in the LERF basins were included as indicator parameters. 32 Tables D-1 through D-3 present a list of dangerous constituents measured as part of routine liquid 33 sampling in the LERF basins from as early as February of 2000 through 2011. The results were further 34 evaluated to identify reliable parameters for the indication or identification of dangerous waste 35 constituents in groundwater, as discussed in Section D1.5. The full list of groundwater monitoring 36 indicator parameters is provided in Section D3.6.1. 37 D3.3 Concentration Limits 38 A series of events that triggers the shift from detection monitoring to compliance monitoring is prescribed 39 in WAC 173-303-645. If there is statistically significant evidence of contamination, as required in 40 WAC 173-303-645(9)(f), groundwater protection standards and concentration limits will be established 41 subsequently in accordance with WAC 173-303-645(9)(g)(iv)(D). Section D3.1 1, Evaluation and 42 Notification, provides the process and schedule for actions, notification, and permit modification, if 43 necessary. D-17

--- Page 959 ---
DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 If a tolerance limit is exceeded at a statistically significant level, additional measurements will be 2 conducted to verify that a detection event has occurred. If the detection of a dangerous constituent is 3 verified, as discussed in Section D3.1 1, compliance monitoring will be implemented in accordance with 4 WAC 173-303-645(10). 5 D3.4 Groundwater Monitoring System and Point of Compliance 6 The groundwater monitoring system for LERF uses existing wells, 299-E26-14 and 299-E26-79. 7 Well 299-E26-14 is an upgradient well and well 299-E26-79 is a downgradient well based on the flow 8 direction presented in Section D2.2.2. A third detection monitoring well will need to be installed just 9 south of the open interval between Basin 43 and 44 in order to compare the groundwater quality 10 downgradient of LERF Basin 44 (Figure D-28). All three of these wells will be monitored in accordance 11 with the requirements provided in this permit. The additional well to be installed, 299-E26-15, will be 12 planned through Tri-Party Agreement (Ecology et al., 1989, Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and 13 Consent Order) Milestone M-024, which is updated on a yearly basis. The well is tentatively planned to 14 be installed prior before fiscal year 2016. 15 D3.5 Compliance Period 16 The compliance period will be the number of years equal to the active life of the waste management area 17 including any additional years required for corrective actions, if necessary. Any additional years 18 associated with corrective actions will be completed after three consecutive years in which the 19 groundwater protective standard for any specific dangerous waste constituent has not been exceeded in 20 accordance with WAC 173-303-645(7). 21 D3.6 Sampling and Analysis 22 This section describes the groundwater detection sampling and analysis program for the three LERF 23 regulated units (Basins 42, 43, and 44), including monitoring parameters, analytical methods, monitoring 24 frequency, and sampling protocols. 25 D3.6.1 Monitoring Parameters 26 Monitoring parameters include the indicator and geochemical parameters. The monitoring of these two 27 parameters is similar, and sampling and analysis frequencies are the same and will be done concurrently 28 on a semiannual basis. 29 As identified in Section DI.5, carbon tetrachloride and TOX are reliable indicator parameters for the 30 presence of dangerous constituents associated with LERF. In addition, the standard parameters of pH, 31 specific conductance, and TOC provide the requirements of detection monitoring in accordance with 32 WAC 173-303-645(9)(a). Table D-7 provides a list of these constituents and the frequency of sampling. 33 Samples will also be collected semiannually and analyzed for major anions, cations, and alkalinity to 34 evaluate groundwater geochemistry, as discussed in Table D-6. 35 Samples also will be collected for Cr(VI) for evaluation as an additional indicator parameter, as discussed 36 in Section D1.5. 37 D3.6.2 Sampling Frequency 38 Samples will be collected semiannually from wells 299-E26-14 and 299-E26-79 to determine whether 39 there is statistically significant evidence of contamination for the indicator parameters established in 40 Section D3.6.1. 41 Samples will be collected semiannually and analyzed for major anions, cations, and alkalinity to evaluate 42 groundwater geochemistry, as discussed in Section D2.3 and shown in Table D-6. D-18

--- Page 960 ---
DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 Finally, samples will be collected semiannually for Cr(VI) evaluation as an indicator parameter, as 2 discussed in Section D 1.5 and Table D-7. 3 D3.6.3 Sampling Procedures 4 Groundwater sampling procedures, sample collection documentation, sample preservation and shipment, 5 and chain-of-custody requirements are described in this subsection. The Permittees will develop, 6 maintain, and conduct work according to procedures consistent with, and no less stringent than, those 7 described to be conducted. The Permittees will maintain current copies of these procedures in the 8 Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF, and 200 Area ETF file, as required by Permit Condition 11.1.1 9 Samplers fill out groundwater sample report forms as they purge and sample each well. Field personnel 10 measure water levels in each well before sampling and then purge stagnant water from the well. Field 11 personnel also record time of sampling, which allows correlation with barometric pressure measurements 12 at the Hanford Meteorological Station. Water levels are typically measured with laminated-steel electrical 13 sounding tapes with a precision of 2 mm. Procedures require sample collection after three casing volumes 14 of water have been purged from the well and after field parameters (pH, temperature, specific 15 conductance, and turbidity) have stabilized. Field parameters are measured in a flow-through chamber. 16 Both filtered and unfiltered samples are collected for metals analyses. Filtering is performed in the field 17 with 0.45-micron, in-line, disposable filters to ensure that results represent dissolved metals and do not 18 include particulates. Dissolved trace metals analysis (from filtered samples) will be used for statistical 19 analyses of trace metal arsenic. 20 Sample preservation techniques will follow generally accepted practices (e.g., U.S. Environmental 21 Protection Agency [EPA]-approved guidelines such as SW-846, Test Methods for Evaluating Solid 22 Waste: Physical/Chemical Methods, Third Edition; Final Update IV-B, Table 11-1, or equivalent) and 23 will be documented in sample authorization forms generated by the Sample and Data Management 24 organization. Chemical preservatives are added to collection bottles before use in the field. A chemical 25 preservative label is affixed to the sample container listing the specific preservative. The preservative's 26 brand name, lot number, concentration, and date opened are recorded. As part of sample preservation, 27 samples may be refrigerated or stored on ice as necessary prior to delivery to the analyzing laboratory. 28 D3.6.4 Sample Chain-of-Custody 29 Groundwater samplers use chain-of-custody forms to document the integrity of groundwater samples from 30 the time of collection through data reporting. The forms are generated during scheduling and are managed 31 through a documented procedure. Required information recorded on the forms includes the following: 32 * Sampler's name 33 * Method of shipment and destination 34 * Collection date and time 35 * Sample identification numbers 36 * Analysis methods 37 * Preservation methods 38 Samples are labeled and sealed with evidence tape, wrapped with bubble wrap, and placed in a 39 U.S. Department of Transportation-approved container with ice, as appropriate. The packaging parameters 40 for samples are determined by associated hazards. Samples for offsite laboratories are shipped according 41 to U.S. Department of Transportation regulations. A chain-of-custody form accompanies all samples. D-19

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 When samples are transferred from one custodian to another (e.g., from sampler to shipper, or from 2 shipper to analytical laboratory), the receiving custodian inspects the form and the samples, noting any 3 deficiencies. Each transfer of custody is documented by the printed names and signatures of the custodian 4 relinquishing the samples and the custodian receiving the samples, as well as the time and date of transfer. 5 Commercial shippers do not sign chain-of-custody forms, but the forms are signed by the receiving 6 laboratory, and sample integrity is verified by inspecting the bottle seals. 7 D3.7 Decontamination of Drilling and Sampling Equipment 8 The following information is included relative to well drilling equipment for new wells installed at LERF 9 for this Permit. Well drilling equipment is decontaminated using high temperature and pressure washing. 10 The equipment then is rinsed with clean water. 11 Equipment for collecting soil samples during drilling for later chemical analysis is decontaminated. 12 Equipment is washed with phosphate-free detergent, rinsed three times with de-ionized water, rinsed once 13 with nitric acid (glass or stainless-steel equipment only), rinsed three more times with de-ionized water, 14 and then finally rinsed with hexane. After heat drying, equipment is wrapped in unused aluminum foil and 15 sealed with tape until needed. The tape shall not come into contact with the equipment to avoid any 16 contamination from the materials in the tape. 17 Monitoring wells for LERF shall be equipped with dedicated sampling pumps. Sample pumps are placed 18 at approximately mid-depth within the screen interval. Water-level measuring tapes are cleaned with 19 potable or deionized water and a clean towel. Sample manifolds used at the well head require 20 decontamination as follows: wash with a phosphate-free detergent, rinse three times in high-purity water, 21 rinse in a 1 M solution of nitric acid, rinse three more times in high-purity water, then rinse in hexane, and 22 finally dry in drying chamber. These are done in accordance with established procedures. 23 D3.8 Quality Objectives and Criteria 24 The QC program is designed to assess and assure the reliability and validity of groundwater data, and to 25 document whether the resulting data are of the quantity and quality necessary for the intended decision- 26 making purpose. In groundwater detection monitoring, the primary decision-making purpose is to 27 determine whether a statistically significant increase in a dangerous constituent concentration is observed 28 in groundwater downgradient from the permitted site. Consequently, data quality is monitored by 29 evaluating the results of QC samples, conducting audits, validating groundwater data, and comparing 30 these results to data quality requirements established in this groundwater monitoring plan. Accuracy, 31 precision, and detection are the primary parameters used to assess data quality. Data for these parameters 32 are obtained from two categories of QC samples: field QC samples that provide checks on field and 33 laboratory activities, and laboratory QC samples that monitor laboratory performance. Table D-8 34 summarizes the types of samples in each category and the sample frequencies and characteristics 35 evaluated. 36 D3.9 Analytical Procedures 37 All field and laboratory instrumentation are calibrated using approved procedures, and analytical 38 measurements are generated according to approved procedures. These procedures include quality checks 39 to ensure the resulting analytical values are of known quality. 40 Instruments for field measurements (e.g., pH, specific conductance, temperature, and turbidity) are 41 verified using standard solutions before use. These include, for pH, 4, 7, and 10 buffer/standard solutions; 42 for specific conductance, 445 uS/cm and 1,413 uS/cm solutions; and for turbidity, Gelex standards 0-10, 43 0-100, and 0-1,000 nephelometric turbidity units. Instruments are operated in accordance with the D-20

--- Page 962 ---
DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 manufacturer's instructions. Each instrument is assigned a unique number that is tracked via calibration 2 documentation and field logbooks and sampling reports. 3 Laboratory analytical methods are specified in Table D-9 and are generally specified in contracts with the 4 laboratories. Laboratory methods for chemical parameters are typically standard methods from SW-846; 5 EPA-600/4-79-020, Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes; or A-PHA/AWWA/WEF, 2012, 6 Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater. Analytes, analytical methods, and 7 required maximum practical quantitation limits are shown in Table D-9. 8 D3.9.1 Quality Control 9 QC data are evaluated based on acceptance criteria for each QC sample type, as summarized by 10 constituent in Table D-10. These criteria limits are intended to provide confidence that the analytical and 11 field methods are in control and provide data of known quality. For field and method blanks, the 12 acceptance limit is two times the instrument detection limit (metals) or method detection limit (other 13 chemical parameters), except for the common laboratory contaminants 2-butanone, acetone, methylene 14 chloride, toluene, and phthalate esters where the limit is five times the method detection limit. 15 Groundwater samples that are associated (i.e., collected on the same date and analyzed by the same 16 method) with out-of-limit field blanks are given a review qualifier of "Q" in the Hanford Environmental 17 Information System (HEIS) database to indicate a potential problem, and then recorded in the Hanford 18 Facility Operating Record, LERF, and 200 Area ETF file pursuant to Permit Condition III.3.D.1.b. 19 Field duplicates must agree within 20 percent (as measured by relative percent difference) to be 20 acceptable. Only those field duplicates with at least one result greater than five times the appropriate 21 detection limit shall be evaluated. In the case where one result is a non-detect, the detection limit is used 22 to calculate the relative percent difference. Unacceptable field duplicate results are given a review 23 qualifier of "Q" in the database and recorded in the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF, and 200 24 Area ETF file. 25 The specified frequency for laboratory duplicates, matrix spikes, matrix spike duplicates, surrogates, and 26 laboratory control samples are defined in Table D-10 in accordance with SW-846. The acceptance criteria 27 for the associated parameter data shall be analyzed and recorded in accordance with Section D3.10.2. 28 Sample holding times depend on the analyte and are specified in the Environmental Quality Assurance 29 Program Plan. Data associated with exceeded holding times are given a review qualifier of "H" in the 30 HEIS database and noted in the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF, and 200 Area ETF file. 31 Data exceeding holding times shall be maintained but potentially may not be used in statistical analyses. 32 Table D-1 1 lists the acceptable accuracy for the blind standards for carbon tetrachloride and TOX. These 33 samples are prepared by spiking Hanford background well water (currently, wells 699-19-88 and 34 699-49-100C) with known concentrations of constituents of interest. Spiking concentrations range from 35 the detection limit to the upper limit of concentration determined in groundwater on the Hanford Site. 36 Investigations shall be conducted for blind standards that are outside of acceptance limits. The results 37 from these standards shall be used to determine acceptability of the associated parameter data. 38 Additional QC measures include laboratory audits and participation in nationally based performance 39 evaluation studies. Audit results are used to improve performance. Summaries of audit results and 40 performance evaluation studies shall be incorporated into the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF, 41 and 200 Area ETF file as appropriate to substantiate data quality objectives (DQOs) and data acceptance 42 criteria.

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 D3.9.2 Data Management 2 This section describes data management practices. 3 Loading Data 4 The contract laboratories report analytical results electronically and in hardcopy. The electronic results 5 shall be loaded into the HEIS database as they are received from the laboratories. The appropriate 6 sections of the HEIS shall be incorporated by reference into the Hanford Facility Operating Record, 7 LERF, and 200 Area ETF file to satisfy Permit Condition III.3D. 1.b. Field data (e.g., specific conductance, 8 pH, temperature, turbidity, and depth to water) are recorded on field records. Data management staff enter 9 field data into the HEIS database manually through data-entry screens and verify each value against the 10 hardcopy. An electronic field data collection system may be implemented soon, which would replace the 11 manual field data collection and the manual data entry process when it is implemented. 12 Data not available electronically may include well logbooks, borehole videos, geologic descriptions, field 13 screening data, or other information. 14 Data Review, Verification, Validation, and Usability 15 The final data review shall determine whether data meet the criteria specified in this subsection. The work 16 activities shall follow documented procedures and processes for data validation and verification. 17 Validation of groundwater data involves assessing whether the data collected and measured meet 18 contractual quality requirements. Verification involves assessing data accuracy, completeness, 19 consistency, availability, and internal control practices to determine overall reliability of the data 20 collected. Other DQOs that shall be met include the proper chain-of-custody, sample handling, use of 21 proper analytical techniques for each constituent, and the quality and acceptability of the laboratory 22 analyses conducted. 23 Groundwater monitoring staff performs checks on laboratory electronic data files for formatting, allowed 24 values, data flagging (qualifiers), and completeness. A percentage of hardcopy results are verified to 25 check for completeness; notes on condition of samples upon receipt by the laboratory; notes on problems 26 that arose during the analysis of the samples; and correct reporting of results. If data are incomplete or 27 deficient, staff will work with the laboratory to correct the problem discovered during the analysis. 28 The data validation process provides the requirements and guidance for validating groundwater data that 29 are routinely collected. Validation is a systematic process of reviewing verified data against a set of 30 criteria (listed in Table D-10) to determine whether the data are acceptable for their intended use. 31 Results of laboratory and field QC evaluations, blind sample results, laboratory performance evaluation 32 samples, and holding-time criteria are considered when determining data usability. Staff review the data 33 to identify whether observed changes reflect changes in groundwater quality or potential data errors, and 34 they may request data reviews of laboratory, field, or water-level data for usability purposes. The laboratory 35 may be requested to check calculations or reanalyze the sample, or the well may be resampled. Results of 36 the data reviews are used to determine what appropriate review qualifier should be applied to the analytical 37 results in the HEIS database (e.g., "R" for reject, "Y" for suspect, or "G" for good) and/or to add comments. 38 Upon final data acceptance, both the raw data and the accepted/validated data shall be incorporated into 39 the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF, and 200 Area ETF file. 40 Data Review Corrective Actions 41 The responses to data quality defects are identified through the verification/validation process. Corrective 42 actions are shown in Table D-8. D-22

DOE/RL-2013-46 Rev. 0 WA7890008967, PART III, OPERATING UNIT GROUP 3 LERF AND 200 AREA ETF 1 D3.9.3 Statistical Analysis of Groundwater Monitoring Data 2 Groundwater monitoring constituents have been identified for the LERF basins and are listed in 3 Table D-10. The dangerous constituents and indicator parameters used to indicate the presence of 4 contamination (WAC 173-303-645(9)(a)) and subject to statistical evaluation are listed in Table D-7 and 5 include carbon tetrachloride, pH, specific conductance, TOC, and TOX. 6 To establish background conditions, the previous data collected over the past two years will be used. 7 Every year, background results will be evaluated for updating the critical mean for each indicator 8 parameter identified in Table D-8. Sample collection and analysis will continue on a semiannual basis. 9 The statistical method for comparing baseline (background) groundwater quality with compliance-point 10 groundwater quality is the Welch's t-test in accordance with WAC 173-303-645(8)(h)(i), and it is 11 recommended for detection monitoring when population variances might differ between two groups, as 12 stated in EPA 530/R-09-007, Statistical Analysis of Groundwater Monitoring Data at RCRA Facilities 13 Unified Guidance. Applying this parametric t-test provides a reasonably robust statistical procedure and 14 assurance when background data are at a minimum and the underlying populations may not meet 15 normality. However, normality can usually be met by log transforming the data. As more background data 16 is generated for well 299-E26-14, additional tests may be applied if spatial variability becomes an issue, 17 such as the Wilcoxon Rank-sum Test. 18 The Welch's t-test procedure can be implemented as follows: 219 I. Compute the sample mean 9, standard deviation s, and variance s , in each of the 20 background and compliance well data sets. S2 S2 21 II. Compute Welch's t-statistic using the following equation t = (XC -XBG nBG nC 22 III. Compute the approximate degrees of freedom using the following equation s 2 Sc (S2BG BG/n12 (S2c /n2df = + -+ knBG nc n BG c 23 IV. Use Table 16-1 of Appendix D in EPA 530/R-09-007 to assign the upper 95 percent 24 critical mean based on the degrees of freedom. 25 V. Compare the t-statistic against the critical point, tqp. When the condition t < tp, conclude 26 there is no statistically significant difference between the background and compliance point 27 population means. If, however, t > tp, conclude that the compliance point population 28 mean is significantly greater than the background mean at the a level of significance. 29 As monitoring continues and the process is shown to be in control (i.e., there is no statistically significant 30 evidence of facility impact to groundwater), the baseline mean and standard deviation should be updated 31 periodically (e.g., every 1 or 2 years) to incorporate the new data (EPA 530/R-09-007). This reduces 32 uncertainty in the background and helps adjust for groundwater influences from outside sources. 33 This updating process should continue for the lifetime of the monitoring program. 34 If an exceedance occurs, resampling will be undertaken to verify or refute the original exceedance. 35 The analytical result from the resample is substituted into the previous formulas in place of the original 36 value obtained, and the Welch's t-test statistic is updated. If resampling does not confirm the exceedance, 37 and ifthe exceedance can be shown to be a measurement in error or a confirmed outlier, it should be 38 excluded from the revised background. Otherwise, any disconfirmed exceedances (including any D-23

Records may be stored in either electronic or hardcopy format. 10 The Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF, and 200 Area ETF file will also include, consistent with 11 Permit Condition III.3.D.1.b, the following items: 12 * Groundwater sample reports 13 * Chain-of-custody forms 14 * Sample receipt records 15 D3.11 Evaluation and Notification 16 Groundwater flow rate and direction in the uppermost aquifer will be evaluated and reported annually. 17 Groundwater indicator parameter data collected under this permit will be reviewed semiannually to 18 determine if there is statistically significant evidence of contamination (in accordance with 19 WAC 173-303-645(9)(f)) using the statistical method provided in Section D3.9.3. The results of the 20 statistical evaluation and associated information will be submitted to the Washington State Department of 21 Ecology (Ecology) annually through the Hanford Site Annual Groundwater Monitoring Report 22 (WAC 173-303-645(9)(c)). 23 If statistically significant evidence of contamination is determined for one or more of the dangerous 24 constituents or indicator parameters, at any monitoring well at the compliance point, the owner or 25 operator may resample within one month and repeat the analysis for the detected compounds in 26 accordance with WAC 173-303-645(9)(g)(ii). The resample data will be compared with the control limit. 27 If resampling confirms statistically significant evidence of contamination, the following actions will be 28 performed in accordance with WAC 173-303-645(9)(g): 29 * Notify Ecology in writing within seven days of the finding, indicating which chemical parameters 30 have shown statistically significant evidence of contamination. 31 * Sample the groundwater in all monitoring wells and determine if constituents included in Ecology 32 Publication 97-407, Chemical Testing Methods for Designating Dangerous Waste: 33 WAC 173-303-090 & -100, Appendix 5, are present, and if so, in what concentration. For any of these 34 compounds detected, the owner or operator may resample within one month of receiving the results 35 and repeat the analysis for those compounds detected. If the constituents are detected in the second 36 analysis, they will form the basis for compliance monitoring. 37 * If dangerous constituent(s) are detected, submit an application for a Permit modification to Ecology 38 within 90 days to establish a compliance monitoring program in accordance with 39 WAC 173-303-645(9)(g)(iv). 40 * If dangerous constituents are not detected, continue to monitor in accordance with the detection 41 monitoring program.

Further discussion on these corrections is provided in Calculations in Support ofthe Low Hydraulic Gradient Evaluation Sudyfor the 200 East Area UwonfinedAquifer (ECF-200EAST-12-0086). After these corrections have been applied, a least square regression of the plane to elevations associated with the well locations is completed to derive the gradient. The gradient, azimuth, R2 ratio, the p-value are provided in the lower part of the table. Briefly, the R2 ratio is the goodness of fit coefficient. Basically, it is the ratio of the sum of squares because of the regression to the total sum of squares. If the ratio of the two sums is close to 1, indicating unity, then the fit is considered good. Likewise, the p-value is the probability that the degree of an apparent spatially dependent trend observed in the data (or a trend of even greater degree) would occur solely by random chance. Thus, if the p-value is less than 0.05, the fitted trend surface is deemed statistically significant. Again, further details of this process calculation are provided in ECF-200EAST-12-0086. D-38

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 F. PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENTION 2 F.1 Preparedness and Prevention Requirements 3 The following sections document the preparedness and prevention measures taken at the Liquid Effluent 4 Retention Facility (LERF) and 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility (ETF). 5 F.1.1 Equipment Requirements 6 The following sections describe the internal and external communications systems and the emergency 7 equipment required that could be activated by the LERF and 200 Area ETF Building Emergency 8 Director (BED). 9 F.1.1.1 Internal Communications 10 When operators are present at the LERF, the operators carry two-way radios to maintain contact with 11 200 Area ETF personnel. The operators at LERF are informed of emergencies (e.g., building and/or area 12 evacuations, take-cover events, high airborne contamination, fire, and/or explosion), and are provided 13 with emergency instructions by several systems. These systems include the mobile two-way radios, and 14 the telephone in the LERF instrument building. 15 The 200 Area ETF is equipped with an intemal communication system to provide immediate emergency 16 instruction to personnel. The onsite communication system at the 200 Area ETF includes telephones, 17 mobile two-way radios, a public address system, and alarm systems. The telephone and radio systems 18 provide for internal and external communication. Alarm systems exist to allow personnel to respond 19 appropriately to various emergencies, including building evacuations, take cover events, and fire and/or 20 explosion. Addendum J provides additional information on the response activities. 21 F.1.1.2 External Communications 22 The LERF and its operators are equipped with devices for summoning emergency assistance from the 23 Hanford Fire Department, the Hazardous Materials Response Team, and/or Hanford patrol, as necessary. 24 External communication to summon emergency assistance is made by a normal telephone system or 25 mobile two-way radios. The LERF telephone is available in the instrumentation building. The 200 Area 26 ETF uses fire alarm pull boxes and telephones for external communication and are located at numerous 27 locations throughout the 200 Area ETF. 28 F.1.1.3 Emergency Equipment 29 The LERF and 200 Area ETF rely primarily on the Hanford Fire Department to respond to fires and other 30 emergencies as described in Permit Attachment 4, Hanford Emergency Management Plan, 31 (DOE/RL-94-02). All LERF and 200 Area ETF operators are familiar with the LERF and 200 Area ETF 32 contingency plans (Addendum J) and are trained in the use of emergency pumping of LERF and 200 Area 33 ETF systems, fire, and communications equipment. 34 Portable fire extinguishers, fire control equipment, spill control equipment, and decontamination 35 equipment is available at various locations in the 200 Area ETF. 36 The 200 Area ETF has fire extinguishers, automatic fire suppression systems (200 Area ETF control room 37 and electrical room), fire alarm pull boxes, and a water spray system (200 Area ETF operating and 38 administrative portions). 39 Respirators, hazardous material protective gear, and special work procedure clothing for 200 Area ETF 40 personnel are kept in the change room at the 200 Area ETF. Safety showers are located in convenient 41 locations in the 200 Area ETF, and emergency eyewashes are available for use. Water for these devices 42 is supplied from the 200 Area ETF sanitary water system. Addendum F.5

--- Page 1033 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I F.1.1.4 Water for Fire Control 2 A water main is not provided to the LERF. The Hanford Fire Department is equipped with fire engines 3 for fire control for fires requiring high water volume and pressure. The 200 Area ETF is serviced by two 4 12-inch raw water lines that are tied into the 200 East Area raw water distribution grids. These lines 5 provide a looped configuration that supplies two independent sources of raw water for fire protection and 6 raw water uses. Connections from the 200 Area ETF raw water system supply fire hydrants and the wet 7 pipe sprinkler system. In the event that water pressure is lost, the Hanford Fire Department is equipped 8 with fire engines to provide needed water. 9 F.1.2 Aisle Space Requirement 10 The operation of the LERF does not involve aisle space. Nevertheless, the LERF and the individual 11 basins are easily accessible to emergency response personnel and vehicles. A 6.1-meter-wide service 12 road runs along the base of the basin area on the east, south, and west sides within the operational security 13 fence. 14 Aisle spacing at 200 Area ETF is sufficient to allow the movement of personnel and fire protection 15 equipment in and around the containers. This storage arrangement also meets the requirements of the 16 National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 1996) for the protection of personnel and the environment. 17 A minimum 30-inch aisle space is maintained between rows of containers as required by 18 WAC 173-303-630(5)(c). 19 F.2 Preventive Procedures, Structures, and Equipment 20 The following sections describe preventive procedures, structures, and equipment. 21 F.2.1 Unloading Operations, Spill Prevention, and Control 22 Underground pipelines that transfer aqueous waste to and from the LERF are encased in a secondary pipe. 23 If a leak is detected in a pipeline, flow in the pipeline will be stopped and the cause of the leak 24 investigated and remediated. 25 If it is required to transfer aqueous waste from one LERF basin to another, existing transfer pumps are 26 used as described in Addendum C. 27 The 200 Area ETF Load-in Station is monitored continuously during tank-filling operations and filling is 28 stopped immediately if leaks occur. Care is taken to ensure that even minor leaks are cleaned up 29 immediately and disposed of in accordance with approved management procedures. Any spill that is 30 determined to be a dangerous waste will be managed according to the requirements of WAC 173-303. 31 F.2.2 Runoff 32 The LERF is constructed and operated to ensure that all aqueous waste is contained within the basins. 33 The basins are designed and operated to prevent overtopping. Furthermore, the basins are provided with 34 very low-density polyethylene floating covers to prevent the introduction of precipitation into the basins. 35 The basins also are graded to ensure that all precipitation outside the basins is directed away from the 36 surface impoundments. 37 The basins are constructed so that the top of the basin dikes are approximately 3 meters above grade. The 38 exterior side slopes of the basins have a 2.25 (horizontal) to I (vertical) slope. Run-on of precipitation to 39 the basins from the surrounding area is not possible because the surrounding area slopes away from the 40 LERF. 41 Dangerous waste and hazardous chemical handling areas at the 200 Area ETF are designed to contain 42 spills, leaks, and wash water, thereby preventing run-off and subsequent releases. All dangerous and/or 43 mixed waste loading and unloading areas are provided with secondary containment structures as 44 described in Addendum C, Process Information. Addendum F.6

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 F.2.3 Water Supplies 2 The LERF uses operating practices, structures, and equipment to prevent the contamination of natural 3 water supplies (i.e., groundwater and surface water). The LERF is monitored continuously in the ETF 4 control room during liquid waste transfers and at least daily at other times to detect abnormal conditions 5 (e.g., leaks), and regularly inspected to detect equipment and structural deteriorations that could allow 6 possible water supply contamination. The basins are provided with a leachate collection system that is 7 designed to contain any leachate generated. These systems, in conjunction with the double-composite 8 liner system and underlying low permeable clay liner, ensure that should a release occur, the release will 9 be fully contained within the basin configuration and, therefore, water supplies will be protected. 10 Addendum J, Contingency Plan, provides information on procedures that are implemented if a release is 11 detected at the LERF. 12 There are no drinking water wells near the 200 Area ETF. Therefore, a release would not immediately 13 contaminate drinking water supplies. The 200 Area ETF uses operating practices, structures, and 14 equipment to prevent the contamination of natural water supplies (i.e., groundwater and surface water). 15 The 200 Area ETF is continuously monitored in the ETF control room during liquid waste processing 16 operations and/or Load-In Station transfer to detect abnormal conditions and at least daily at other times , 17 and is inspected regularly to detect equipment and structural deteriorations that could allow spills to the 18 environment. Areas in contact with dangerous and/or mixed waste are monitored continuously in the ETF 19 Control room during Load-in Station and/or ETF processing operations through a series of level and 20 pressure indicators, leak detection alarms, equipment failure alarms, and control panel readouts. In 21 addition, the 200 Area ETF is inspected regularly for the presence of leaks or other off normal conditions 22 wherever possible (in all areas that can be safely entered). 23 In addition to detailed operating practices, structures and equipment are used at the 200 Area ETF to 24 prevent contamination of water supplies. The structures and equipment designed to prevent 25 contamination of water supplies are the same as the structures and equipment used to prevent run-off from 26 dangerous and/or mixed waste handling areas. 27 F.2.4 Equipment and Power Failure 28 The storage function of the LERF is not affected by loss of power and a temporary loss of power would 29 not pose a threat to the environment. Loss of electrical power would not cause the storage of the waste to 30 be jeopardized. For process condensate transferred from the 242-A Evaporator, appropriate valving 31 procedures are followed to ensure a smooth restart of the flow to the LERF in the event of a power failure 32 at the 242-A Evaporator. 33 The 200 Area ETF does not have a standby power source. Power to selected lighting, computers, and 34 process controls is configured with an uninterruptible power supply. During partial loss of normal power, 35 the effected pumps and subsystems will be shut down. Complete loss of power to the 200 Area ETF 36 shuts down the entire 200 Area ETF except for the instruments in the control room connected to the 37 uninterruptible power supply. Redundant pumps allow the process to continue to operate when only one 38 component is out of service. 39 When power at the 200 Area ETF is lost, the valves assume a fail-safe position to allow the process to 40 remain in a safe shutdown mode until restoration of power. This action allows the operators to perform 41 equipment surveys during shutdown and to confirm that there are no safety issues because the 200 Area 42 ETF is shut down. Because a power failure would also shutoff flow into the 200 Area ETF, there will not 43 be any increase in volume in any of the holdup basins, tanks, or other systems. 44 A combination of reliability, redundancy, maintenance, and repair features are used in the 200 Area ETF 45 equipment and systems to minimize random failure of equipment. For crucial systems such as ventilation 46 filters, redundant trains are provided to mitigate equipment and system failure. Spare parts are 47 maintained for essential production and safety equipment. Addendum F.7

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 F.2.5 Personnel Exposure 2 At the LERF and 200 Area ETF, operating practices, structures, and equipment are used to prevent undue 3 exposure of personnel to dangerous and/or mixed waste. All personnel handling waste use protective 4 clothing and equipment. All operations are conducted so that exposure to dangerous and/or mixed waste 5 and hazardous materials are maintained as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). 6 Protective clothing and equipment are prescribed for personnel handling chemicals or dangerous waste. 7 Before the start of any operation that could expose personnel to the risk of injury or illness, a review of 8 the operation is performed to ensure that the nature of hazards that might be encountered is considered 9 and appropriate protective gear is selected. Personnel are instructed to wear personal protective 10 equipment in accordance with training, posting, and instructions. 11 A change trailer at LERF is located between Basins 42 and 43. In addition, the change trailer has an 12 operations office for working with procedures. Exits within the change trailer are clearly marked. A 13 storage building is located within the perimeter fence, northwest of the basins. The LERF storage 14 building also is provided with separate storage areas for clean and contaminated equipment. A 15 decontamination shower and decontamination building is located at the 272-AW Building, approximately 16 1.6 kilometers from the LERF or at the 200 Area ETF. 17 The 200 Area ETF has eyewash stations and safety showers in convenient locations for use by personnel. 18 The following structures and equipment were incorporated into the 200 Area ETF design to minimize 19 personnel exposure. 20 * Offices, control room, clean- and soiled-clothes storage areas, change rooms, and the lunchroom 21 are situated to minimize casual exposure of personnel. 22 * Building exit pathways are located to provide rapid egress in emergency evacuations. 23 * Emergency lighting devices are located strategically throughout the 200 Area ETF. 24 * Audio and/or visual alarms are provided for all room air samplers, area alarms, and liquid 25 monitors. Visual readouts for these alarm systems are located in less contaminated areas to 26 minimize exposure to personnel. 27 * Areas for decontaminating and maintaining equipment are provided in contaminated areas to limit 28 the spread of contamination to uncontaminated areas such as the control room. 29 * Instrument interlock systems automatically return process operations to a safe condition if an 30 unsafe condition should occur. 31 * The 200 Area ETF ventilation systems are designed to provide airflow from uncontaminated 32 zones to progressively more contaminated zones. 33 Whenever possible, exposures to hazards are controlled by accepted engineering and/or administrative 34 controls. Protective gear is used where effective engineering or administrative controls are not feasible. 35 F.3 Prevention of Reaction of Ignitable, Reactive, and Incompatible Waste 36 Typically, aqueous waste managed at the LERF or 200 Area ETF does not display the characteristics of 37 reactivity or ignitability. Any aqueous waste streams exhibiting these characteristics are blended or 38 mixed at LERF to a concentration where the waste no longer exhibits reactive or ignitable characteristics. 39 Incompatible aqueous waste is not expected to be stored or treated at the LERF or 200 Area ETF 40 (Addendum B, Waste Analysis Plan). Therefore, the requirements of WAC 173-303-806(4)(a) are not 41 applicable. 42 Addendum F.8

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I H. CLOSURE PLAN 2 This addendum describes the planned activities and performance standards for closing Liquid Effluent 3 Retention Facility (LERF) and 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility (ETF). 4 H.1 Closure Plan 5 The LERF and 200 Area ETF will be closed by removal or decontamination with respect to dangerous 6 waste contamination that resulted from operation asTtreatment, Storage, and Disposal (TSD) units, with 7 closure of LERF occurring first. To facilitate closure, the LERF retention basins are being viewed as 8 consisting of seven components: the covers and primary liner, drainage layer system/bentonite carpet 9 liner, secondary liner, soil/bentonite, internal and/or external piping, ancillary equipment, and concrete 10 basins. To facilitate closure of 200 Area ETF, the 200 Area ETF is being viewed as consisting of six 11 components: tanks, internal and/or external piping, ancillary equipment, concrete floors/dikes/ 12 encasements, structures, and soil directly beneath the structure. It is anticipated that closure of LERF and 13 200 Area ETF will begin after the projected 30-year active life of LERF and 200 Area ETF. If it is 14 determined that closure by removal or decontamination is not possible, the closure plan will be modified 15 to address required post closure activities. 16 Uncontaminated structures will be left for future use or disassembled, dismantled, and removed for 17 disposal. Uncontaminated equipment and structures could include aqueous makeup, HVAC and piping, 18 steam condensate and cooling water piping, and the control room and office areas. 19 Closure by removal or decontamination requires decontamination or removal and disposal of all 20 dangerous waste, waste residues, contaminated equipment, soil, or other material established in 21 accordance with the removal or decontamination closure performance standards of WAC 173-303-610(2). 22 This and future closure plan revisions will provide for compliance with these performance standards. 23 H.2 Closure Performance Standard 24 Closure by removal or decontamination, as provided for in this plan based on the requirements of 25 WAC 173-303-610(2), will eliminate future maintenance and will be protective of human health and the 26 environment by removing or reducing chemical contamination at LERF and 200 Area ETF to levels that 27 are below concern with respect to human health and the environment. 28 This plan proposes to leave clean structures and equipment in place after closure for potential use in 29 future operations. This need will be evaluated at the time of closure. 30 H.2.1 Closure Standards for Metal Surfaces, Rubber, Tanks, and Concrete 31 This closure plan proposes use of a 'clean debris surface' (defined in the following paragraph) as the clean 32 closure performance standard for the metal surfaces, rubber (i.e., basin covers, liners, etc.), tanks, and 33 concrete that will remain after closure. This approach is consistent with the Washington State 34 Department of Ecology (Ecology) guidance (Publication #94-111, Ecology 2005) for achievement of 35 clean closure. Additionally, adherence to this guidance ensures that all residues have been removed as 36 required by WAC 173-303-640 for closure of the 200 Area ETF tank systems. 37 The clean debris surface standard is verified visually. 38 A clean debris surface means the surface, when viewed without magnification, shall be free of all 39 visible contaminated soil and hazardous waste except residual staining from soil and waste 40 consisting of light shadows, slight streaks, or minor discolorations and soil and waste in cracks, 41 crevices, and pits may be present provided that such staining and waste and soil in cracks, crevices, 42 and pits shall be limited to no more than 5% of each square inch ofsurface area (40 CFR 268.45). 43 When a physical extraction method is used on concrete, the performance standard is based on removal of 44 the contaminated layer of debris. The physical extraction performance standard for concrete is removal of 45 0.6 centimeter of the surface layer and treatment to a clean debris surface. Inspections to verify 46 achievement of a clean debris surface will be performed and documented. Addendum H.5

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I H.2.2 Closure Standards for Piping and Ancillary Equipment 2 The internal and external piping of both LERF and 200 Area ETF that has contacted dangerous waste will 3 be flushed and drained as part of closure. When practical, ancillary equipment, which has contacted 4 dangerous waste will also be flushed and drained. For piping and ancillary equipment where the 5 contaminated surfaces can be inspected, an inspection will be performed to see if the surfaces meets the 6 clean debris surface standard in 40 CFR 268.45, incorporated by reference by WAC 173-303-140, and 7 can be declared non-dangerous in accordance with WAC 173-303-071(3)(qq). If it is not possible to 8 inspect the contaminated surfaces or meet the clean debris surface performance standard, the particular 9 piping or ancillary equipment of concern will be removed, designated, and disposed of accordingly. 10 Dangerous and/or mixed-waste materials generated during closure activities will be managed in 11 accordance with WAC 173-303-610(5). Removal of any dangerous wastes or dangerous constituents 12 during partial or final closure will be handled in accordance with applicable requirements of 13 WAC 173-303-610(5). 14 H.2.3 Closure Standards for Underlying Soils 15 The LERF retention basins have a leachate collection system that channels the leachate to sumps at the 16 bottom of the basins. The collected liquid is pumped back into the basins, thereby limiting fluid head on 17 the secondary liner. The secondary liner is comprised of several protective layers, including a high- 18 density polyethylene geomembrane and a soil/bentonite admixture. The soil below the LERF only could 19 be contaminated if the layers of the secondary liner had failed. The primary liner and the drainage gravel, 20 geotextile, and geonet between the primary and secondary liners cannot easily be decontaminated. The 21 high-density polyethylene layer of the secondary liner also cannot be decontaminated. These materials 22 will be removed and disposed according to the requirements of WAC 173-303-170. The soil/bentonite 23 admixture will be sampled and analyzed for constituents of concerns according to the sampling and 24 analysis plan developed prior to the time of closure. If the analytical results determine that the 25 constituents of concern are at or below the levels in WAC 173-303-610(2)(b)(i), or background levels for 26 Hanford soil if background is greater, the soil/bentonite admixture and the soil below LERF will be 27 considered clean closed. 28 Clean closure of soil under the 200 Area ETF will be accomplished by demonstrating that the coated 29 concrete floor kept contaminants from reaching the soil. The coated concrete floor provided secondary 30 containment for all the tanks and process piping. Unless inspections identify potential through-thickness 31 cracks indicating containment failure and a subsequent potential for soil contamination from TSD unit 32 operations, the soil will be considered clean closed. However, if inspections identify such cracks and 33 there have been documented spills in the vicinity, potential soil contamination will be investigated. Soils 34 will be sampled and analyzed for constituents of concern according to the sampling and analysis plan. 35 The sampling and analysis plan will be prepared following the completion of a data quality objectives 36 process in accordance with EPA/600/R-96/055 (QA/G-4), Data Quality Objectives Process, as amended. 37 The data quality objectives process will be initiated prior to closure on a schedule to ensure timely closure 38 of LERF. The sampling and analysis plan will be submitted to Ecology as part of a permit modification 39 request meeting the requirements of WAC 173-303-830. The sampling and analysis plan will be prepared 40 consistent with EPA/240/B-01/003 (EPA/QA R-5), EPA Requirements for Quality Assurance Project 41 Plans, as amended. 42 If the soil analytical results determine that the constituents of concern are at or below the levels in 43 WAC 173-303-610(2)(b)(i), or background levels in the Hanford soil if background is greater, the soil 44 will be considered clean closed. If the constituents of concern exceed background levels, the soil will be 45 closed per the standards of WAC 173-303-610(2)(b). 46 H.3 Closure Activities 47 The LERF and 200 Area ETF were designed for a 30-year active life. Addendum H.6

--- Page 1048 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I At the time of closure, the closure plan will be modified as necessary to reflect current regulation or 2 informational revisions in accordance with WAC 173-303-610(3)(b). If it is determined that clean 3 closure is not possible, the closure plan will be modified to address required post closure activities. 4 H.3.1 General Closure Activities 5 The approach to LERF closure is to dispose of accumulated basin aqueous waste by processing the waste 6 through 200 Area ETF. Primary basin liners, covers, drainage gravel, geonets, and secondary High 7 Density Polyethylene (HDPE) liners will be removed, designated, and disposed of as described in 8 Section G.3.4.1. Any remaining solids (residue) within the basins will also be removed, designated, and 9 disposed of accordingly. Piping associated with LERF closure is intended to be decontaminated, drained, 10 and inspected. Piping that meets the closure standard in Section G.2.2 will be left in place. Piping that 11 does not meet the closure standard, or cannot be inspected, will be disposed of accordingly. Rinsate 12 generated during decontamination also will be disposed of through 200 Area ETF. Sampling will assess 13 whether contamination beneath the secondary HDPE liner has occurred. Contamination above 14 background levels, if present, will be removed or decontaminated to meet the regulatory requirements of 15 WAC 173-303-610(2)(b). 16 The approach to 200 Area ETF closure is to process any aqueous waste through the effluent treatment 17 system. Any waste, which cannot be treated at 200 Area ETF as the facility is being closed, will be 18 transferred to other TSD units or off-site TSD facility. Piping will be rerouted and temporary piping 19 installed to allow the isolation of tanks and ancillary equipment for draining, decontamination, and 20 closure. Rerouted and temporary piping will be closed in the same manner as process piping. All 21 structures and equipment will be decontaminated to the closure standards in Section G.2.2 or disposed. 22 Piping associated with 200 Area ETF closure is intended to be decontaminated, drained, and inspected. 23 Piping that meets the closure standard in Section G.2.2 will be left in place. Piping that does not meet the 24 closure standard, or cannot be inspected, will be disposed of accordingly. Contamination, if present, will 25 be managed in compliance with regulatory requirements. 26 Equipment or materials used in performing closure activities will be decontaminated or disposed at a 27 permitted facility. 28 H.3.2 Constituents of Concern for Closure for the Liquid Effluent Retention Facility and 29 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility 30 Using the list of dangerous waste numbers in the Addendum A, Part A Form, constituents in the final 31 delisting in 40 CFR 261 Appendix IX, sample results from wastes added to LERF and 200 Area ETF, 32 process knowledge and the risk to human health and the environment, the constituents of concern for 33 closure will be determined through the data quality objective process. Based on constituents in 34 wastewater received at LERF from 2000 to 2006 which are present at five percent of their delisting levels 35 or higher, the constituents of concern are: * Acetone * Carbon tetrachloride * Methyl ethyl ketone * Vanadium * Ammonia * Fluoride * n-Butyl alcohol * Barium * Lead * Total cresols * Chromium * Mercury * Tributyl phosphate 36 Arsenic and beryllium are excluded because they are present in Hanford soils and may therefore give a 37 false positive sample result. Constituents of concern vary in each basin. For example, ammonia may be 38 present only in LERF Basin 42. The constituents of concern for each basin will be determined by process 39 knowledge as part of the Data Quality Objectives process for the Sampling and Analysis Plan. 40 H.3.3 Removing Dangerous Waste 41 At the start of LERF closure, aqueous waste will be transferred sequentially from each basin to another 42 LERF basin or to 200 Area ETF for treatment. Addendum H.7

--- Page 1049 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I At a pump rate of about 284 liters per minute, it will take approximately 60 days to empty a full basin. 2 Basin covers will remain in place to prevent possible wind dispersion of waste until all basin waste has 3 been removed. 4 All of the aqueous waste inventory at the 200 Area ETF will be processed before closure. Any residue 5 remaining in piping, equipment, or the LERF liner will be removed to an appropriate disposal unit. All 6 containerized waste will be dispositioned. All secondary waste in containers will be transferred to an 7 appropriate TSD unit. 8 H.3.4 Decontaminating Structures, Equipment, and Soils 9 This section discusses the activities necessary to implement a clean closure strategy for the LERF and 10 200 Area ETF. 11 H.3.4.1 Covers and Primary Liner 12 The following steps will be performed to close each LERF basin cover and primary liner: 13 * Wastewater will be removed from the basins and transferred to another LERF basin or to 14 200 Area ETF. Additional pumps and piping may be installed to empty the basin as low as 15 possible. 16 * The basin cover will be cut into pieces and disposed in containers. 17 * As much as practical of the remaining residue within the basins will be removed and transferred 18 to containers, another LERF basin, or 200 Area ETF. Rinsing may be performed to facilitate 19 removal. 20 * The pipe risers, transfer pump, HDPE primary liner and bentonite carpet liner will be cut into 21 pieces and disposed in containers. 22 H.3.4.2 Drainage Layer and Secondary Liner 23 The following steps will be performed to close each LERF basin drainage layer and secondary liner: 24 * The drainage gravel, geotextile, and geonet will be cut into pieces, and disposed in containers. 25 * As much as practical of the remaining residue on the secondary liner will be removed and 26 transferred to containers, another LERF basin or 200 Area ETF. Rinsing may be performed to 27 facilitate removal of residue. 28 * The HDPE liner portion of the secondary liner will be visually inspected for physical damage. 29 This will provide potential sampling locations to determine if the soil/bentonite below the HDPE 30 liner may be clean closed. 31 * The leachate pump, pump riser, and HDPE liner portion of the secondary liner will be removed, 32 cut into pieces, and disposed in containers. 33 * The soil/bentonite portion of the secondary liner will be visually inspected for signs of 34 contamination. This will provide potential sampling locations to determine if the soil/bentonite 35 may be clean closed. 36 Assessment of contamination beneath the LERF's secondary liner will be performed within each basin by 37 sampling the top surface of the 97-centimeter thick layer of soil/bentonite. Biased and random location 38 selection will be used to increase the probability of detecting leachate contamination. Some sampling 39 points will be chosen randomly, while others will be chosen where physical damage was noted during the 40 inspection of the secondary HDPE liner and soil/bentonite layer, and in areas where the underlying 41 material porosity and permeability and the hydraulic head would most likely drive any leachate. The 42 leakage rate through the liner would increase toward the bottom of the liner as hydraulic head increases. 43 Any leakage that did occur in the sloped sides could be expected to travel down slope through the 44 geotextile between the primary and secondary liner until reaching the bottom of the liner. Addendum H.8

--- Page 1050 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I Therefore, the most likely area of contamination would be the soil/bentonite in the leachate sump and at 2 the bottom of the basin. Sampling and disposal objectives will be determined at the time prior to closure 3 activities through the data quality objectives process. The sampling and analysis plan will be prepared 4 following the completion of a data quality objectives process in accordance with EPA/600/R-96/055 5 (QA/G-4) Data Quality Objectives Process, as amended. 6 The data quality objectives process will be initiated prior to closure on a schedule to ensure timely closure 7 of LERF. The sampling and analysis plan will be submitted to Ecology as part of a permit modification 8 request meeting the requirements of WAC 173-303-830. The sampling and analysis plan will be prepared 9 consistent with EPA/240/1B-0 1/003 (EPA/QA R-5), EPA Requirements for Quality Assurance Project 10 Plans, as amended. 11 Sampling of the soil/bentonite will be performed in accordance with the sampling methods allowed for in 12 WAC 173-303-110(2). Special care will be needed in sampling for volatiles. To aid in ensuring sample 13 integrity, the initial sampling of the soil/bentonite may proceed while the secondary HDPE liner is in the 14 process of being removed. 15 If no constituents of concern are found above soil closure performance standards (Section G.2.3), no 16 further analysis will be done. If the initial sample analysis indicates liner leakage, additional samples 17 from different depths and locations will be taken to determine the spatial extent of contamination. The 18 soil/bentonite will be removed in the area around the contamination and placed in containers. If 19 contamination is found to extend through the entire depth of the soil/bentonite layer, soil beneath the 20 basin that is contaminated above closure performance standards will also be removed and placed in 21 containers. 22 H.3.4.3 Tanks 23 The following general steps will be performed to close, each 200 Area ETF tank and ancillary equipment: 24 * Wastewater and chemical additions to the tank will be isolated or rerouted to a downstream tank. 25 * Piping and ancillary equipment associated with the tank will be flushed with water and drained to 26 the tank being closed, to another tank, or to containers. 27 * Wastewater will be removed from the tank and transferred to another tank. Additional pumps and 28 piping may be installed to empty the tank as low as possible. 29 * All remaining residue at the bottom of the tank will be removed and transferred to another tank or 30 containers. Rinsing may be performed to facilitate removal of residue. 31 * An initial visual inspection of the tank's interior and exterior surfaces will be performed to 32 determine the type of flushing that will allow the tank to be clean closed, or whether the tank 33 cannot be clean closed. 34 * The tank's surfaces, piping and ancillary equipment will be cleaned by chemical or physical 35 extraction techniques described in 40 CFR 268.45. Flush solution will be transferred to another 36 tank or containers. All flush solution at the bottom of the tank will be removed before visual 37 inspection. 38 * The tank, piping, and ancillary equipment will be inspected visually for compliance with the 39 performance standard in Sections H.2.1 and H.2.2. 40 Closure will begin with the Load-In Station tanks, surge tank, and other tanks of the main treatment train. 41 The secondary treatment train will operate as long as possible to reduce the volume of flush water 42 requiring disposal. Condensate from the secondary treatment train will be routed to the main treatment 43 train or the verification tanks for storage or treatment. 44 After rinsing, the tanks will be inspected visually for compliance with the performance standard. Visual 45 inspection might be made remotely using a camera or other device that allows verification of meeting the 46 performance standard. Addendum H.9

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I If any areas are found not meeting the clean debris surface performance standard, these areas will be 2 decontaminated in-place, or the contaminated portions will be removed, designated, and disposed 3 accordingly. Per 40 CFR 268.45, Table 1 incorporated by reference at WAC 173-303-140, only removal 4 of contaminants from the surface layer is necessary for metal surfaces. 5 The outside of the tanks also will be inspected for compliance to the performance standard. Any areas 6 found not to meet this performance standard will be decontaminated in-place, or the contaminated 7 portions will be removed, designated, and disposed accordingly. 8 Before using decontamination solutions on the outside of the tanks, the floor will be inspected for cracks 9 or other openings that could provide a pathway to soil. This inspection will be performed as described in 10 Section G.2.3 in conjunction with mapping of potential through-thickness cracks. Any such cracks will 11 be mapped. The cracks will be sealed before beginning treatment or other engineered containment 12 devices (e.g., portable catch basins, liners) will be used to collect and contain solutions. 13 Decontamination residues will be collected, designated, and managed as appropriate. If it is not possible 14 to meet the clean closure performance standard, contaminated portions of the tanks could be removed, 15 designated, and disposed of accordingly. The inspections for a clean debris surface will be documented 16 on an inspection record. 17 H.3.4.4 Internal and External Piping and Ancillary Equipment 18 The internal piping and ancillary equipment for both LERF and 200 Area ETF, which have contacted 19 dangerous waste will be flushed and drained as part of closure. Any treatment media, such as filters, 20 reverse osmosis membranes, ion exchange resins, will be removed from the ancillary equipment, and 21 disposed of accordingly. Where the contaminated surfaces can be inspected, an inspection will be 22 performed to see if the piping and ancillary equipment meet the clean debris surface standard in 23 40 CFR 268.45 and can be declared non-dangerous. If it is not possible to meet the clean debris surface 24 standard or the piping or ancillary equipment cannot be inspected, those portions of the piping and 25 ancillary equipment will be removed, designated, and disposed of accordingly. 26 External piping (transfer lines) associated with LERF and 200 Area ETF consist of below grade and 27 above grade piping. Below grade, piping will be dispositioned at closure consistent with the practices for 28 below grade piping in the 200 Areas at the time of closure consistent with the 200-IS-I operable unit 29 decisions. Above grade piping will be dispositioned consistent with the provisions for internal piping. 30 Rinsate from the LERF and 200 Area ETF external piping and LERF internal piping will be processed 31 through 200 Area ETF. Dangerous and/or mixed-waste solutions and materials generated during closure 32 activities, which cannot be treated at 200 Area ETF will be managed in accordance with 33 WAC 173-303-610(5). 34 H.3.4.5 Concrete 35 At LERF, the concrete catch basins are located at the northeast corner of each retention basin, where inlet 36 pipes, leachate risers, and transfer pipe risers emerge for the basin. The concrete catch basin is curbed, 37 and coated with a chemical resistant epoxy sealant. The concrete catch basin is sloped so that any leaks 38 or spills from the piping or connections will drain into the basin. At the 200 Area ETF, the coated 39 concrete floor and berm provides secondary containment for all the tanks and process piping. 40 Closure of concrete at LERF and 200 Area ETF will be performed after the associated tanks, piping, 41 ancillary equipment, and structures have been closed. All concrete will be inspected visually and 42 surveyed before any decontamination. The purpose of the inspection will be twofold: to identify and 43 map any cracks in the concrete that might have allowed contaminants a pathway to the soil below 44 (Section G.2.3.), and to identify areas that potentially are contaminated with dangerous waste or 45 dangerous waste residues. The inspection standard will be a clean debris surface as defined in 46 Section G.2.1. The inspection of the concrete for a clean debris surface will be documented on an 47 inspection record. Those areas already meeting the standard can be clean closed as is. Addendum H.10

--- Page 1052 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 Those potentially contaminated areas will undergo decontamination to meet the clean closure standard of 2 a clean debris surface. The concrete will be washed down; the rinsate collected, designated, and disposed 3 of accordingly. The concrete will be reinspected for a clean debris surface. Concrete surfaces indicated 4 by visual examination, as still being potentially contaminated will have the surface layer removed to a 5 depth of 0.6 centimeter by scabbing or other approved methods. This will not threaten the environment, 6 even if potential through-thickness cracks had been found during the inspection, because concrete 7 decontamination (scabbing) will not employ liquid solutions that could enter cracks and because scabbing 8 residues will be vacuumed away from cracks as, any residue is generated. 9 Achievement of a clean debris surface will be documented on an inspection record. Decontamination 10 residues will be collected, designated, and managed as appropriate. 11 H.3.4.6 Structures 12 If contaminated with either dangerous or mixed waste constituents, the 200 Area ETF structures will be 13 decontaminated and/or disassembled, if necessary, packaged, and disposed of in accordance with existing 14 land disposal restrictions (WAC 173-303-140). 15 Closure steps could include the following activities. 16 * Containerize (as necessary and practicable) and remove any remaining waste. 17 * Review operating records for spillage incidents and visually inspect storage area surfaces for 18 evidence of contamination or for cracks that could harbor contamination or allow the escape of 19 decontamination solutions. Inspect storage area surfaces for visible evidence of contamination 20 (e.g., discoloration, material degradation, wetness, and odor). If contamination is evident, the 21 affected area(s) will be decontaminated. 22 * Decontaminate 200 Area ETF walls and floors to minimize the potential for loose contamination 23 and facilitate any required surveys and/or chemical field screening. The structures could be 24 cleaned by water rinse or high-pressure, low-volume steam cleaning coupled with a detergent 25 wash. After decontamination, the walls and floors will be compared to closure performance 26 standards. 27 * Collect rinsate and manage as dangerous waste for appropriate disposal. 28 * Secure (lock) personnel entries into building and post doors with appropriate warning signs. 29 H.3.4.7 Underlying Soils 30 Clean closure of soil under LERF's secondary liner will be accomplished by demonstrating that the liners 31 and leak detection system kept contaminants from reaching the soil. The secondary liner provided 32 secondary containment for the LERF basins. Unless inspections identify potential leaks, punctures, 33 cracks, or tears indicating containment failure and a subsequent potential for soil contamination from 34 TSD unit operations, the soil will be considered clean closed. However, if inspections identify such leaks, 35 punctures, etc., potential soil contamination will be investigated. 36 Clean closure of soil under 200 Area ETF will be accomplished by demonstrating that the coated concrete 37 floor kept contaminants from reaching the soil. The coated concrete floor and bermed area provided 38 secondary containment for all the tanks and process piping. Unless inspections identify potential 39 through-thickness cracks indicating containment failure and a subsequent potential for soil contamination 40 from TSD unit operations, the soil will be considered clean closed. However, if inspections identify such 41 cracks and there have been documented spills in the vicinity, potential soil contamination will be 42 investigated. 43 Where it is possible visually to inspect directly beneath the tanks, a visual inspection will be performed. 44 Where it is not possible visually to inspect beneath the tanks, an evaluation of the tank integrity will be 45 made. The condition of the tank will be evaluated to determine if there was any potential for leakage. If 46 no cracks, severe corrosion, or evidence of leaks is observed, it will be reasoned that mixed or dangerous 47 waste solutions could not have penetrated to the soil directly below the tank. Addendum H.11

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 External piping (transfer lines) between the 242-A Evaporator and LERF and 200 Area ETF are double 2 lined with a leak detection system. If records indicate that no leaks from the primary piping occurred, the 3 soil will be considered clean with respect to RCRA closure. 4 Where there is evidence that contamination may have leaked into the soil below tanks, concrete, or the 5 soil/bentonite layer at LERF, the contaminated tank, concrete, or soil/bentonite layer will be removed to 6 allow the underlying soil to be sampled to determine the depth of the contamination. 7 Soil that is contaminated above the closure performance standards in Section G.2.3 will be removed, 8 placed in containers, and disposed accordingly. 9 H.4 Maximum Waste Inventory 10 The maximum waste inventory for LERF and 200 Area ETF is in Addendum A. 11 H.5 Closure of Containers, Tanks, and Surface Impoundments 12 The following sections cover closure of containers, closure of tanks, and closure of surface 13 impoundments. 14 H.5.1 Closure of Containers 15 Containers at 200 Area ETF will be used to contain dangerous waste in the event of a spill, unexpected 16 release, or equipment failure. Containers will be used to accumulate nonradioactive dangerous waste 17 and/or mixed wastes. All containers will be emptied and treated prior to closure of 200 Area ETF. Any 18 containers used to contain dangerous and/or mixed waste at the 200 Area ETF that is generated during the 19 closure process and therefore cannot be treated at 200 Area ETF will be designated and shipped to an 20 onsite TSD unit or off-site TSD facility. Containers of dangerous and/or mixed waste will not be left in 21 the 200 Area ETF after closure. 22 H.5.2 Closure of Tanks 23 Clean closure of 200 Area ETF will consist of the removal and disposal of all dangerous waste and the 24 decontamination and/or removal and disposal of equipment which does not meet the performance 25 standards in Section G.2, including tanks. The 200 Area ETF was designed to incorporate removable 26 components. This design facilitates closure by allowing complete removal of equipment, which does not 27 meet the performance standards. 28 H.5.3 Closure of Surface Impoundments 29 At closure, all of LERF that received regulated waste will be closed in accordance with the requirements 30 of this approved closure plan, which are intended to ensure compliance with the requirements of 31 WAC 173-303-650(6)(a)(i). All equipment, structures, and other material associated with closure of 32 LERF will be decontaminated or removed in accordance with WAC 173-303-610(2). All basin waste and 33 decontamination rinsate will be transferred to 200 Area ETF. Sampling and testing will be conducted as 34 described in Section G.3.4.2. 35 H.6 Schedule for Closure 36 Closure of LERF and 200 Area ETF is not anticipated to occur within the next 30 years. The actual year 37 of closure will depend on the time required for current waste to be processed and what role the LERF and 38 200 Area ETF will play in processing additional waste generated during future activities in the 200 Areas. 39 Other factors affecting the year of closure include changes in operational requirements, lifetime extension 40 upgrades, and unforeseen factors. When a definite closure date is established, notification of closure will 41 be provided in accordance with Permit Condition II.J.1. 42 The activities required to complete closure are planned to be accomplished within 180 days in accordance 43 with WAC 173-303-610(4)(b). Should a modified schedule be necessary, a revised schedule will be 44 proposed through the permit modification procedure in accordance with WAC 173-303-610(4)(b). 45 Addendum H.12

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 1. INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS 2 1.1 Inspection Plan 3 This addendum describes the method and schedule for inspections of the Liquid Effluent Retention 4 Facility (LERF) and 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility (ETF). The purpose of inspections is to help 5 ensure that situations do not exist that might cause or lead to the release of dangerous and/or mixed waste 6 that could pose a threat to human health and the environment. Abnormal conditions identified by an 7 inspection will be corrected on a schedule that prevents hazards to workers, the public, and the 8 environment. 9 1.1.1 General Inspection Requirements 10 The content and frequency of inspections are described in this section. Inspection records are retained in 11 the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF and 200 Area ETF file, or other approved locations, in 12 accordance with Permit Condition 11.1.1. 13 In certain areas of the 200 Area ETF, many inspections are performed remotely to maintain as low as 14 reasonably achievable (ALARA) exposure. Monitoring instruments are connected to audible alarms and 15 visual indicators track alarm status. The monitoring system provides trending of selected monitoring 16 data, graphics, and equipment summary displays. 17 A preventive maintenance recall system is employed to direct preventive maintenance activities at the 18 LERF and 200 Area ETF. Equipment requiring maintenance is checked as indicated by the maintenance 19 history and the manufacturer's recommendations. The preventive maintenance of certain equipment 20 might not be possible if the LERF or the 200 Area ETF is in an operational mode. Thus, the preventive 21 maintenance could be performed slightly earlier or later than planned to minimize impact on operations. 22 Instrumentation at 200 Area ETF is calibrated regularly to ensure accuracy and reliability. All process 23 control instrumentation is calibrated on a schedule depending on previous calibration experience. An 24 instrument calibration and recall system is employed to manage calibrations. 25 1.1.1.1 Types of Problems 26 Key components of the LERF inspection program include the following areas: 27 * Structural integrity of the basins. 28 * Catch basin secondary containment system integrity. 29 * Evidence of release from basins. 30 * Safety, communications, and emergency equipment. 31 Key components of the 200 Area ETF inspection program include the following areas: 32 * Condition of tanks and ancillary piping. 33 * Condition of containers. 34 * Condition of the process control equipment. 35 * Condition of emergency equipment. 36 * Condition of secondary containment. 37 Table 1.1 and Table 1.2 provide a description of LERF and 200 Area ETF items to be inspected. 38 1.1.1.2 Frequency of Inspections 39 The frequency of inspections is based on the rate of possible deterioration of equipment and the 40 probability of a threat to human health or the environment. 41 The LERF and 200 Area ETF is inspected as indicated in Table 1.1 and Table 1.2. Addendum 1.5

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 1.1.2 Specific Process Inspection Requirements 2 The following sections describe the specific process inspections performed at LERF and 200 Area ETF. 3 1.1.2.1 Container Inspections 4 Containers are used at the 200 Area ETF to store solidified secondary waste, such as the powder waste 5 from the thin film dryer and maintenance and operations waste. When containers are being held in 6 container storage areas, the following inspection schedule is maintained: 7 * Daily visual inspection of container storage area for leaks, spills, accumulated liquids, and open 8 or improperly sealed containers. 9 * Weekly visual inspection of container labels to ensure labels are not obscured, removed, or 10 otherwise unreadable. 11 * Weekly visual inspection for deterioration of containers, containment systems, or cracks in 12 protective coating or foundations caused by corrosion, mishandling, or other factors. 13 Following the inspections, an inspection datasheet is signed and dated by the inspector and supervisor. 14 1.1.2.2 Tank Inspections 15 A description of the tank systems and ancillary equipment at the 200 Area ETF is given in Addendum C. 16 Inspections and frequencies are given in Table 1.1 and Table 1.2. This section includes a brief discussion 17 of the inspections. 18 1.1.2.2.1 Overfill Protection 19 Tanks that have the possibility of being overfilled have level instrumentation that alarms before the tanks 20 reach overflow. High tank level alarms annunciate in the control room, allowing operating personnel to 21 take immediate action to stop the vessels from overfilling. These alarms are monitored continuously in 22 the control room during solution transfers. 23 1.1.2.2.2 Visual Inspections 24 Visual inspections of tanks and secondary containments are performed to check for leaks, signs of 25 corrosion or damage, and malfunctioning equipment. Inspections are performed on tanks, secondary 26 containment within the 200 Area ETF, surge tank, and verification tank, and associated secondary 27 containment. 28 1.1.2.2.3 Secondary Containment Leak Detectors 29 The surge tank and verification tank secondary containment systems have sloped floors that drain 30 solutions to sumps equipped with leak detectors that alarm in the control room. These alarms are 31 monitored continuously in the control room during ETF processing operations and at least daily at other 32 times. If an alarm is activated, further investigation is performed to determine if the source is a tank leak 33 or other solution (i.e., precipitation). 34 1.1.2.2.4 Integrity Assessments 35 The initial integrity assessment was issued in 1995 (Addendum C). Consistent with the recommendations 36 of the integrity assessment, a periodic integrity assessment program was developed for the 200 Area ETF 37 tanks and is discussed in detail in Addendum C, Section C.4.2. 38 1.1.2.2.5 Effluent Treatment Facility Piping 39 The 200 Area ETF employs an extensive piping system. During inspections at the 200 Area ETF, any 40 aboveground piping is inspected visually for signs of leakage and for general structural integrity. During 41 the visual inspection, particular attention is paid to valves and fittings for signs of cracking, deformation, 42 and leakage. Addendum 1.6

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 1.1.2.3 Surface Impoundments and Condition Assessment 2 The following describes the surface impoundment inspections performed at LERF. 3 1.1.2.3.1 Overtopping Control 4 Under current operating conditions, 1.34 meters of freeboard is maintained at each LERF basin, which 5 corresponds to a normal operating level of 6.1 meters, or 24.6 million liters. Level indicators at each 6 basin are monitored to confirm that this level is not exceeded. 7 Before an aqueous waste is transferred into a basin, administrative controls are implemented to ensure 8 overtopping will not occur during the transfer. The volume of feed to be transferred is compared to the 9 available volume in the receiving basin. The transfer is not initiated unless there is sufficient volume 10 available in the receiving basin or a cut-off level is established. The transfer into the basin would be 11 stopped when this cut-off level is reached. 12 The LERF basins also are provided with floating very low-density polyethylene covers that are designed 13 and constructed to prevent overtopping by the introduction of precipitation and dust into the basins. 14 Overtopping and flow control also are discussed in Addendum C. 15 1.1.2.3.2 Impoundment Contents 16 The LERF basins are inspected weekly to assess whether the contents are escaping from a basin. Level 17 indicators are inspected weekly to check for unaccountable change in the level of the basins. 18 1.1.2.3.3 Leak Detection 19 The leachate detection, collection, and removal system is described in Addendum C. The leachate 20 collection sump pump is activated when the liquid level in the leachate sump reaches a preset level. A 21 flow meter/totalizer measures the amount of leachate removed. In addition, the timer on the leachate 22 pump tracks the cumulative pump run time. The leak rate through the primary liner can be determined 23 using one of two methods: 1) measured as the leachate flow meter/totalizer readings or pump operating 24 time readings (flow meters/totalizers are located on the outflow line from the collection sumps in the 25 bottom of the LERF basins) or 2) calculated using the pump operating time readings multiplied by the 26 pump flow rate (the pump runs at a constant flow rate). Calculations using either method are sufficient for 27 compliance. If either the flow meter/ totalizer or pump operating time system is not functioning, this is 28 identified as an abnormal condition (see I.1).The LERF employs a double walled transfer piping between 29 242-A Evaporator and LERF and between LERF and 200 Area ETF. The WAC 173-303-650 regulations 30 do not require a discussion of piping for surface impoundments. However, for the purposes of 31 comprehensive coverage of the LERF, inspections and integrity assessments are performed on the piping 32 system. Aqueous waste (e.g., process condensate) is transferred from the 242-A Evaporator to the LERF 33 via a buried pipeline. Likewise, aqueous waste is transferred to the 200 Area ETF via buried pipelines. 34 At the LERF dikes, aboveground piping serves to transfer waste from one basin to another. 35 The buried pipelines normally are continuously monitored during transfers by a leak detection system 36 (Addendum C). The alarms on the leak detection system signal to the 200 Area ETF control room, which 37 is monitored continuously during waste transfers and daily when no waste is transferring. .As an 38 alternative to continuous leak detection, the transfer lines can be inspected daily during transfers by 39 opening the secondary containment drain lines at the LERF catch basins (for 242-A Evaporator transfers 40 to LERF) and the surge tank (for LERF transfers to 200 Area ETF) to inspect for leakage. During the 41 routine inspections at LERF, the aboveground piping system is inspected for signs of leakage and for 42 general structural integrity. During the visual inspection, particular attention is paid to valves and fittings 43 for signs of cracking, deformation, and leakage. 44 1.1.2.3.4 Dike Erosion 45 The LERF basins and dikes are visually inspected weekly and after significant precipitation events for 46 run-on, run-off, cover integrity, erosion problems, or other signs of deterioration in the dikes from 47 precipitation, wind, burrowing mammals, or vegetation. Addendum 1.7

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 1.1.2.3.5 Structural Integrity 2 A written certification attesting to the structural integrity of the basin dikes, signed by a qualified, 3 registered professional engineer, is provided in Addendum C. 4 1.1.2.3.6 Container Inspection 5 Normal operation of the LERF does not involve the storage of dangerous waste in containers. Therefore, 6 the inspection requirements of this section normally are not applicable to the LERF. Any containerized 7 dangerous waste generated at LERF will be brought to the 200 Area ETF and managed in accordance 8 with WAC 173-303-630 and is discussed in Section 1.1.3. 9 1.1.3 Inspection Log 10 Observations made and deficiencies noted during an inspection are recorded on inspection log sheets (also 11 called turnover sheets). On completion, the log sheet includes the inspector's printed name, signature, 12 date, and time; the log sheet is submitted for review and approval by LERF and200 Area ETF 13 management or their designee, as required by operating procedures. Once approved, the log sheet is kept 14 in the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF and 200 Area ETF files. Inspection records are retained 15 in the Hanford Facility Operating Record, LERF and 200 Area ETF files, or other approved locations, in 16 accordance with Permit Condition 11.1.1. The inspection records are used to help determine any necessary 17 corrective actions. Problems identified during the inspections are prioritized and addressed in a timely 18 fashion to mitigate health risks to workers, maintain integrity of the TSD units, and prevent hazards to 19 public health and the environment. 20 If while performing an inspection, a leak or spill is discovered, facility operations responds per the 21 emergency response procedures action is taken to stop the leak and determine the cause. The waste is 22 removed from the secondary containment in a timely manner that prevents harm to human health and the 23 environment. 24 1.1.4 Storage of Ignitable or Reactive Wastes 25 The LERF could receive an aqueous waste that is designated reactive or ignitable. Any aqueous waste 26 exhibiting these characteristics is managed (e.g., through blending in LERF) such that the waste no longer 27 exhibits the reactive or ignitable characteristics. 28 Though unlikely, the 200 Area ETF secondary wastes might have the characteristics of being reactive or 29 ignitable. A qualified inspector performs annual fire inspections of the 200 Area ETF using a checklist 30 developed specifically for facilities that handle dangerous and/or mixed waste. 31 Addendum 1.8

Alternate evacuation routes will be used on a case-by-case basis based on 4 meteorological conditions at the time of the event. 5 J.2 Building Emergency Director 6 Emergency response will be directed by the Building Emergency Director (BED) until the Incident 7 Commander (IC) arrives. The Incident Command System and staff with supporting on-call personnel 8 fulfill the responsibilities of the Emergency Coordinator as discussed in WAC 173-303-360. 9 During events, ETF/LERF personnel perform response duties under the direction of the BED. The 10 Incident Command Post (ICP) is managed by the senior Hanford Fire Department official, unless the 11 event is determined to be primarily a security event, in which case the Hanford Fire Department and 12 Hanford Patrol will operate under a unified command system with Hanford Patrol making all decisions 13 pertaining to security. These individuals are designated as the IC and as such, have the authority to 14 request and obtain any resources necessary for protecting people and the environment. The BED 15 becomes a member of the ICP and functions under the direction of the IC. In this role, the BED continues 16 to manage and direct LERF/ETF operations. 17 A listing of BEDs by title, work location, and work telephone numbers is contained in Section J.7 of this 18 plan. The BED is on the premises or is available through an "on-call" list 24 hours a day. Names and 19 home telephone numbers of the BEDs are available from the Patrol Operations Center (POC) in 20 accordance with Permit Condition II.A.4. 21 J.3 Implementation of the Plan 22 In accordance with WAC 173-303-360(2)(b) the BED ensures that trained personnel identify the 23 character, source, amount, and areal extent of the release, fire, or explosion to the extent possible. 24 Identification of waste can be made by activities that can include, but are not limited to, visual inspection 25 of involved containers, sampling activities in the field, reference to inventory records, or by consulting 26 with facility personnel. Samples of materials involved in an emergency might be taken by qualified 27 personnel and analyzed as appropriate. These activities must be performed with a sense of immediacy 28 and shall include available information. 29 The BED shall use the following guidelines to determine if an event has met the requirements of 30 WAC 173-303-360(2)(d): 31 1. The event involved an unplanned spill, release, fire, or explosion, 32 AND 33 2.a The unplanned spill or release involved a dangerous waste, or the material involved became a 34 dangerous waste as a result of the event (e.g., product that is not recoverable.), or 35 2.b The unplanned fire or explosion occurred at the ETF/LERF or transportation activity subject 36 to RCRA contingency planning requirements, 37 AND 38 3. Time urgent response from an emergency services organization was required to mitigate the 39 event or a threat to human health or the environment exists. 40 As soon as possible, after stabilizing event conditions, the BED shall determine, in consultation with the 41 site contractor environmental single point-of-contact, if notification to the Washington State Department 42 of Ecology (Ecology) is needed to meet WAC 173-303-360(2)(d) reporting requirements. If all of the 43 conditions under 1, 2, and 3 are met, notifications are to be made to Ecology. Additional information is 44 found in Permit Attachment 4, Hanford Emergency Management Plan, (DOE/RL-94-02), Section 4.2. 45 Addendum J.7

--- Page 1076 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I If review of all available information does not yield a definitive assessment of the danger posed by the 2 incident, a worst-case condition will be presumed and appropriate protective actions and notifications will 3 be initiated. The BED is responsible for initiating any protective actions based on their best judgment of 4 the incident. 5 The BED must assess each incident to determine the response necessary to protect the personnel, facility, 6 and the environment. If assistance from Hanford Patrol, Hanford Fire Department, or ambulance units is 7 required, the Hanford Emergency Response Number (911 from site office phones/373-091 1 from cellular 8 phones) must be used to contact the POC and request the desired assistance. To request other resources 9 or assistance from outside the ETF/LERF, the POC business number is 373-3800. 10 J.3.1 Protective Actions Responses 11 Protective action responses are discussed in the following sections. The steps identified in the following 12 description of actions do not have to be performed in sequence because of the unanticipated sequence of 13 incident events. 14 J.3.1.1 Evacuation 15 The objective of a facility evacuation order is to limit personnel exposure to hazardous materials or 16 dangerous/mixed waste by increasing the distance between personnel and the hazard. The scope of the 17 evacuation includes evacuation of the facility because of an event at the facility as well as evacuation of 18 the facility in response to a site evacuation order. Evacuation will be directed by the BED when 19 conditions warrant and will apply to all personnel not actively involved in the event response or 20 emergency plan related activities. 21 The BED will initiate the evacuation by directing an announcement be made to evacuate along with the 22 evacuation location over a public address system, facility radios, and, as conditions warrant, by activating 23 the 200 Area site evacuation alarms by calling the POC using 911 from site office phones/373-09 11 from 24 cellular phones. Personnel proceed to a predetermined staging area (shown in Figure J.2), or other safe 25 upwind location, as determined by the BED. The BED will determine the operating configuration of the 26 facility and identify any additional protective actions to limit personnel exposure to the hazard. 27 Emergency organization personnel or assigned operations personnel will conduct a sweep of occupied 28 buildings to ensure that all non-essential personnel and visitors have evacuated. For an immediate 29 evacuation, accountability will be performed at the staging area. The BED will assign personnel as 30 accountability aides and staging managers with the responsibility to ensure that evacuation actions are 31 taken at all occupied buildings at the ETF/LERF. All implementing actions executed by the 32 aides/managers are directed by the emergency response procedures. When evacuation actions are 33 complete, the aides/managers will provide a status report to the BED. The BED will provide status to the 34 IC. 35 Addendum J.8

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I J.3.1.2 Take Cover 2 The objective of the take cover order is to limit personnel exposure to hazardous materials, or 3 dangerous/mixed waste when evacuation is inappropriate or not practical. Evacuation might not be 4 practical or appropriate because of extreme weather conditions or the material release might limit the 5 ability to evacuate safely personnel. 6 The BED will initiate the take cover by directing an announcement be made over the public address 7 system, facility radios, and, as conditions warrant, by activating the 200 Area site take cover alarms by 8 calling the POC using 911 from site office phones/373-091 I from cellular phones). Actions to complete a 9 facility take-cover will be directed by the emergency response procedure. Protective actions associated 10 with operations include configuring, or shutting down, the ventilation systems. Determination of 11 additional take cover response is based on plant operating configuration, weather conditions, amount and 12 duration of release, and other conditions, as applicable to the event and associated hazard. As a 13 minimum, personnel exposure to the hazard will be minimized. The BED will assign personnel as 14 accountability aides with responsibility to ensure that take-cover actions are taken at all occupied 15 buildings at the ETF complex. All implementing actions executed by the aides/managers are directed by 16 the emergency response procedure. When take cover actions are complete, the aides/manager will 17 provide the BED with a status report. 18 J.3.2 Response to Facility Operations Emergencies 19 Depending on the severity of the following events, the BED reviews the site wide procedures and 20 ETF/LERF emergency response procedure(s) and, as required, categorizes and/or classifies the event. If 21 necessary, the BED initiates area protective actions and Hanford Site Emergency Response Organization 22 activation. The steps identified in the following description of actions do not have to be performed in 23 sequence because of the unanticipated sequence of incident events. 24 J.3.2.1 Loss of Utilities 25 A case-by-case evaluation is required for each event to determine loss of utility impacts. When a BED 26 determines a loss of utility impact, actions are taken to ensure dangerous and/or mixed waste is being 27 properly managed, to the extent possible given event circumstances. As necessary, the BED will stop 28 operations and take appropriate actions until the utility is restored. 29 J.3.2.2 Major Process Disruption/Loss of Plant Control 30 The hazards assessment has determined that this occurrence does not pose significant risk to human 31 health or the environment. 32 J.3.2.3 Pressure Release 33 The hazards assessment has determined that a pressure release does not pose significant risk to human 34 health or the environment. Hazardous material release and dangerous/mixed waste releases are addressed 35 in Section J.2.5. 36 J.3.2.4 Fire andlor Explosion 37 In the event, of a fire, the discoverer activates a fire alarm (pull box); calls 911 from site office 38 phones/373-0911 from cellular phones or verifies that the Hanford Emergency Response Number has 39 been called. Automatic initiation of a fire alarm (through the smoke detectors, and sprinkler systems) is 40 also possible. 41 * Unless otherwise instructed, personnel shall evacuate the area/building by the nearest safe exit 42 and proceed to the designated staging area for accountability. 43 * On actuation of the fire alarm, ONLY if time permits, personnel should shut down equipment, 44 secure waste, and lock up classified materials (or hand carry them out). The alarm automatically 45 signals the Hanford Fire Department. Addendum J. 11

--- Page 1080 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF 1 * The BED proceeds directly to the ICP, obtains all necessary information pertaining to the 2 incident, and sends a representative to meet Hanford Fire Department. 3 * The BED provides a formal turnover to the IC when the IC arrives at the ICP. 4 * The BED informs the Hanford Site Emergency Response Organization as to the extent of the 5 emergency (including estimates of dangerous waste and mixed waste quantities released to the 6 environment). 7 * If operations are stopped in response to the fire, the BED ensures that systems are monitored for 8 leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, and ruptures. 9 * Hanford Fire Department firefighters extinguish the fire as necessary. 10 Note: Following a fire and/or explosion, WAC 173-303-640(7) will be addressed for the ETF regarding 11 fitness for use. 12 J.3.2.5 Hazardous Material, Dangerous andlor Mixed Waste Spill 13 Spills can result from many sources including process leaks, container spills or leaks, damaged packages 14 or shipments, or personnel error. Spills of mixed waste are complicated by the need to deal with the extra 15 hazards posed by the presence of Atomic Energy Act materials. These controls include containment 16 berms, dedicated spill control sumps, remote gauges, and level indicators as well as spray shields on 17 chemical pipe flanges. WRPS procedures provide alarm response and maintenance actions for leak 18 detection equipment, surveillance of possible leak locations, and response actions for detected spills. 19 * The discoverer notifies BED and initiates SWIMS response: 20 Stops work 21 Warns others in the vicinity 22 Isolates the area 23 Minimizes the exposure to the hazards 24 Requests the BED Secure ventilation 25 * If Operations are stopped, the BED ensures that the plant is put in a safe shutdown configuration. 26 * The BED determines if emergency conditions exist requiring response from the Hanford Fire 27 Department based on classification of the spill and injured personnel, and evaluates need to 28 perform additional protective actions. 29 * If the Hanford Fire Department resources are not needed, the spill is mitigated with resources 30 identified in Section J.4 of this plan and proper notifications are made. 31 * If the Hanford Fire Department resources are needed, the BED calls 911 from site office 32 phones/373-091 I from cellular phones. 33 * The BED sends a representative to meet the Hanford Fire Department. 34 * The BED provides a formal turnover to the IC when the IC arrives at the ICP. 35 * The BED informs the Hanford Site Emergency Response Organization as to the extent of the 36 emergency (including estimates of dangerous waste and mixed waste quantities released to the 37 environment). 38 * If operations are stopped in response to the spill, the BED ensures that systems are monitored for 39 leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, and ruptures. 40 * Hanford Fire Department stabilizes the spill. 41 Note: For response to leaks or spills and disposition of leaking or unfit-for-use tank systems, refer to 42 WAC 173-303-640(7).

WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I J.3.2.5.1 Damaged, or Unacceptable Shipments 2 During the course of receiving an onsite transfer of dangerous and/or mixed waste at ETF/LERF an 3 unanticipated event could be discovered resulting in a conformance issue concerning the waste. 4 Damaged or unacceptable shipments resulting from onsite transfers are not subject to WAC 173-303-370 5 however conformance issues must be resolved in order to maintain proper records. 6 The following actions are taken to resolve the conformance issue: 7 * Operations management is notified of the damaged or unacceptable waste to be received. 8 * If the conformance issue results in a spill or release, actions described in Section J.3.2.5 are taken. 9 * The generating organization is notified of the conformance issue. 10 An operations representative, in conjunction with the generating organization, determines the course of 11 action to resolve the conformance issue. 12 J.3.3 Prevention of Recurrence or Spread of Fires, Explosions, or Releases 13 The BED, as part of the ICP, takes the steps necessary to ensure that a secondary release, fire, or 14 explosion does not occur. The BED will take measures, where applicable, to stop processes and 15 operations, collect and contain released waste, and remove or isolate containers. The BED also monitors 16 for leaks, pressure buildups, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, whenever 17 this is appropriate. 18 J.3.4 Incident Recovery and Restart of Operations 19 A recovery plan is developed when necessary in accordance with Permit Attachment 4, Hanford 20 Emergency Management Plan, (DOE/RL-94-02), Section 9.2. A recovery plan is needed following an 21 event where further risk could be introduced to personnel, the ETF/LERF, or the environment through 22 recovery action and/or to maximize the preservation of evidence. 23 If this plan was implemented according to Section J.3 of this plan, Ecology is notified before operations 24 can resume. The Permit Attachment 4, Hanford Emergency Management Plan, (DOE/RL-94-02), 25 Section 5.1 discusses different reports to outside agencies. This notification is in addition to those 26 required reports and includes the following statements: 27 * There are no incompatibility issues with the waste and released materials from the incident. 28 * All the equipment has been cleaned, fit for its intended use, and placed back into service. 29 The notification required by WAC 173-303-360(2)0) may be made via telephone conference. Additional 30 information that Ecology requests regarding these restart conditions will be included in the required 31 15-day report identified in Section J.5 of this plan. 32 For emergencies not involving activation of the Hanford EOC, the BED ensures that conditions are 33 restored to normal before operations are resumed. If the Hanford Site Emergency Response Organization 34 was activated and the emergency phase is complete, a special recovery organization could be appointed at 35 the discretion of RL to restore conditions to normal. This process is detailed in RL and contractor 36 emergency procedures. The makeup of this organization depends on the extent of the damage and the 37 effects. The onsite recovery organization will be appointed by the appropriate contractor's management. 38 J.3.5 Incompatible Waste 39 After an event, the BED or the onsite recovery organization ensures that no waste that might be 40 incompatible with the released material is treated, stored, and/or disposed of until cleanup is completed. 41 Cleanup actions are taken by ETF/LERF personnel or other assigned personnel. Permit Attachment 4, 42 Hanford Emergency Management Plan, (DOE/RL-94-02), Section 9.2.3, describes actions to be taken. Addendum J.13

--- Page 1082 ---
WA7890008967 LERF and 200 Area ETF I Waste from cleanup activities is designated and managed as newly generated waste. A field check for 2 compatibility before storage is performed as necessary.

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels X. Other Environmental Permits (see instructions) A. Permit Type B. Permit Number C. Description E A I R 0 2 -1 2 2 1 WAC-246-247, NOC XI. Nature of Business (provide a brief description that includes both dangerous waste and non-dangerous waste areas and activities) SectionXIV *The estimated annual quantity of waste listed represents the maximum quantity of waste placed in either tunnel in a given year. Process Code X99 is being used to designate the PUREX Storage Tunnels as a Miscellaneous Unit per WAC 173-303-680. The PUREX Storage Tunnels, a miscellaneous unit (X99), are used for storage of mixed waste subject to the requirements of WAC 173-303-680. The two tunnels store waste from the PUREX Plant and other onsite sources. Since being placed into service, mixed waste has been stored in the tunnels on railcars. Not all material stored in the tunnels contains mixed waste. The construction of Tunnel Number 1 was completed in 1956. The tunnel is approximately 5.8 meters (19 feet) wide by 6.7 meters (22 feet) high by 109 meters (358 feet) long and provides storage space for eight railcars. Between June 1960 and January 1965, all eight railcar positions were filled and the tunnel subsequently was sealed. The combined volume of the equipment stored on the eight railcars presently in Tunnel Number 1 is approximately 596 cubic meters (780 cubic yards). The maximum process design capacity for storage in Tunnel Number 1 is approximately 4,129 cubic meters (5,400 cubic yards). The construction of Tunnel Number 2 was completed in 1964. Tunnel Number 2 is approximately 8 meters (19 feet) wide by 6.7 meters (22 feet) high by 514 meters (1,686 feet) long and provides storage space for 40 railcars. The first railcar was placed in Tunnel Number 2 in December 1967 and as of August 2000, 28 railcars have been placed in the tunnel. The combined volume of equipment stored on the 28 railcars presently in Tunnel Number 2 is approximately 2,204 cubic meters (2,883 cubic yards). The maximum process design capacity for storage in Tunnel Number 2 is approximately 19,878 cubic meters (26,000 cubic yards). The waste stored in the tunnels could include barium(D005), cadmium (D006), chromium (D007), lead (D008), mercury (D009), selenium (DO10), silver (3011), and light mineral oil (WTO2, state-only, toxic, dangerous waste) contained in oil absorption material. The silver is predominately in the form of salts and is considered ignitable (DO01) because of the presence of silver nitrate (AgNO 3). Cadmium also could be considered state-only, toxic, dangerous waste (WTO2). Chapter 1.5

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels XIV. Description of Dangerous Wastes Example for completing this section: A facility will receive three non-listed wastes, then store and treat them on-site. Two wastes are corrosive only, with the facility receiving and storing the wastes in containers. There will be about 200 pounds per year of each of these two wastes, which will be neutralized in a tank. The other waste is corrosive and ignitable and will be neutralized then blended into hazardous waste fuel. There will be about 100 pounds per year of that waste, which will be received in bulk and put into tanks. A. Dangeros B. Estimated C. Unit of D.

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 3.0 WASTE ANALYSIS PLAN 2 This chapter provides information on the chemical, biological, and physical characteristics of the 3 dangerous waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels. Waste in the tunnels is stored and managed as 4 mixed waste. The PUREX Storage Tunnels provide the necessary shielding for the protection of 5 employees and the environment from mixed waste. 6 3.1 Chemical, Biological, and Physical Analyses 7 Regulated material presently stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels contains the following dangerous 8 waste: 9 * Lead 10 * Mercury 11 * Silver and silver salts 12 * Chromium 13 * Cadmium 14 * Barium 15 * Mineral oil 16 In general, dangerous waste is either attached to, contained within, or actually is material removed from 17 the PUREX Plant and other onsite sources. Changes in dangerous waste stored is updated annually in the 18 annual dangerous waste report submitted to Ecology. Future storage of barium and selenium may occur 19 in Tunnel Number 2. The PUREX Storage Tunnels are permitted as a miscellaneous unit under 20 WAC 173-303-680 because the tunnels are not a typical containerized storage unit. That is, the bulk of 21 the material stored in the tunnels is not placed in a container; rather, this material is placed on a portable 22 device (railcar) used as a storage platform. The mixed waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is 23 encased or contained within carbon or stainless steel plate, pipe, or vessels that meet the 24 WAC 173-303-040 definition of container. Therefore, the mixed waste normally is not exposed to the 25 tunnel environment. 26 The only free-liquid dangerous waste stored in the tunnels is elemental mercury. The mercury is 27 contained within thick-walled (0.8-centimeter) thermowells. The amount of mercury per thermowell is 28 less than 1.7 liters. 29 Other liquid containers, such as large discarded process tanks, are stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels. 30 These containers are 'empty' [per WAC 173-303-160(2)(a)]. In the future, containers will be flushed and 31 the final rinsate sampled and analyzed to verify that the residual heel is not a dangerous waste. 32 The only stored mixed waste that is designated as either reactive or ignitable (DOO1) is silver nitrate in the 33 silver reactors [WAC 173-303-090(5)]. There is no mixed waste designated as reactive (1003). The 34 potential for ignition from this source is considered negligible because this material is dispersed on 35 ceramic packing and is physically isolated from contact with any combustible material or ignition source. 36 3.2 Tracking System 37 Specific waste tracking forms for the movement of waste destined for the PUREX Storage Tunnels are 38 used. These waste tracking forms effectively track waste inventories from generation through storage. 39 The waste tracking forms and other supporting documentation will be maintained at the Hanford Facility 40 for a minimum of 5 years following closure of the PUREX Storage Tunnels.

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 3.3 Facility Description 2 This waste analysis plan (WAP) has been prepared for the PUREX Storage Tunnels, located on the 3 Hanford Facility, Richland, Washington. This WAP applies to all mixed waste (containing dangerous 4 components) regulated by WAC 173-303 that is transferred to and/or contained in the PUREX Storage 5 Tunnels. 6 The PUREX Storage Tunnels are permitted as a miscellaneous unit under WAC 173-303-680. The bulk 7 of the waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is not placed in a typical container; rather, this waste is 8 placed on a portable device (railcar) that is used as a storage platform. In general, the mixed waste stored 9 in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is encased or contained within carbon or stainless steel plate, pipe, or 10 vessels. Therefore, the mixed waste normally is not exposed to the tunnel environment. 11 The PUREX Facility, located in the 200 East Area, consists of two separate treatment, storage, and/or 12 disposal (TSD) units, the PUREX Plant (202-A Building) and the PUREX Storage Tunnels. Access to 13 the PUREX Storage Tunnels is by means of the railroad tunnel. 14 The PUREX Storage Tunnels branch off from the railroad tunnel and extend southward from the east end 15 of the PUREX Plant. The tunnels are used for storage of mixed waste from the PUREX Plant and from 16 other onsite sources. Each storage tunnel is isolated from the railroad tunnel by a water-fillable shielding 17 door. There are no electrical utilities, water lines, drains, fire detection or suppression systems, or 18 communication systems provided inside the PUREX Storage Tunnels. 19 Material selected for storage is loaded on railcars modified to serve as both transport and storage 20 platforms. Normally, a remote-controlled, battery-powered locomotive was used to position the railcar in 21 the storage tunnel. In the past and possibly in the future, other remote movers, e.g., standard locomotive 22 with a string of railcar spacers, power winch, etc., have or could be used to position a railcar in the tunnel 23 or to withdraw a car from the tunnel. The railcar storage positions are numbered sequentially, 24 commencing with Position I that abuts the rail stop bumper at the south end of each tunnel. Position 2 is 25 the location of the railcar that abuts the railcar in Position I and so forth. The railcars and material remain 26 in the storage tunnel until final disposition is determined. Each railcar is retrievable; however, because 27 the railcars are stored on a single, dead-end railroad track, the railcars can be removed only in reverse 28 order (i.e., last in, first out). 29 Construction of Tunnel Number I was completed in 1956. The Tunnel has three areas, the water-fillable 30 door, the storage area, and the vent shaft. The water-fillable door is located at the north end of Tunnel 31 Number I and separates the storage tunnel from the railroad tunnel. The door is 7.5 meters high, 32 6.6 meters wide, and 2.1 meters thick, and is constructed of 1.3-centimeter steel plate. The door is hollow 33 so that the door can be filled with water to act as a shield when the door is in the down (closed) position. 34 If the door is filled with water, the water must be pumped from the door before the door can be raised. 35 Above the door is a reinforced concrete structure in which the door is raised to open the tunnel. Electric 36 hoists used for opening and closing the door are located on the top of this concrete structure. 37 The storage area is that portion of the tunnel that extends southward from the water-fillable door. Inside 38 dimensions of Tunnel Number I are 109.1 meters long, 6.7 meters high, and 5.9 meters wide. Ceiling 39 and walls are 35.6-centimeters thick and constructed of 30.5- by 35.6-centimeter creosote pressure-treated 40 Douglas fir timbers arranged side by side. The first 30.5 meters of the east wall are constructed of 41 0.9-meter-thick reinforced concrete. A 40.8-kilogram mineral-surface roofing material was used to cover 42 the exterior surface of the timbers before placement of 2.4 meters of earth fill. The earth cover serves as 43 protection from the elements and as shielding. The timbers that form the walls rest on reinforced concrete 44 footings 0.9 meter wide by 0.3 meter thick. The floor consists of a railroad track laid on a gravel bed. 45 The space between the ties is filled to top-of-tie with gravel ballast. The tracks are on a 1.0 percent 46 downward slope to the south to ensure that the railcars remain in their storage position. A railcar bumper 47 is located 2.4 meters from the south end of the tracks to act as a stop. The capacity of the storage area is 48 eight, 12.8-meter-long railcars. Chapter 3.8

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels I In June 1960, the first two railcars were loaded with a single, approximately 12.5-meter-long, failed 2 separation column and placed in Tunnel Number 1. Between June 1960 and January 1965, six more 3 railcars were placed in Tunnel Number 1, filling the tunnel. After the last car was placed in the 4 northern-most storage position (Position 8), the water-fillable door was closed, filled with water, and 5 deactivated electrically. 6 Construction of Tunnel Number 2 was started and completed in 1964. Like Tunnel Number 1, Tunnel 7 Number 2 consists of three functional areas: the water-fillable door, the storage area, and the vent shaft. 8 Construction of Tunnel Number 2 differs from that of Tunnel Number I as follows. 9 * A combination of steel and reinforced concrete was used in the construction of the storage area 10 for Tunnel Number 2 rather than wood timbers, as used in Tunnel Number 1. 11 * Tunnel Number 2 is longer, having a storage capacity of five times that of Tunnel Number 1. 12 * The floor of Tunnel Number 2, outboard of the railroad ties, slopes upward to a height of 13 approximately 1.8 meters above the railroad bed, whereas the floor in Tunnel Number 1 remains 14 flat all the way out to the sidewalls. 15 * The railroad tunnel approach to Tunnel Number 2 angles eastward then angles southward to 16 parallel Tunnel Number 1. The approach to Tunnel Number I is a straight extension southward 17 from the PUREX Plant. Center-line to center-line distance between the two tunnels is 18 approximately 18.3 meters. 19 The physical structure of the water-fillable door at the north end of Tunnel Number 2 essentially is 20 identical to the water-fillable door for Tunnel Number 1. The water-fillable door for Tunnel Number 2 is 21 approximately 57.9 meters south and 18.3 meters east of the water-fillable door for Tunnel Number 1. As 22 of March 1997, the door is empty and there is no plan to fill the door. 23 The storage area of Tunnel Number 2 is that portion of the tunnel extending southward from the 24 water-fillable door. Construction of this portion of Tunnel Number 2 consists of a 10.4-meter diameter, 25 steel (0.5 centimeter plate), and semicircular-shaped roof, supported by internal I-beam wales attached to 26 external, reinforced concrete arches. The concrete arches are 0.4 meter thick and vary in width from 27 0.4 to 1.8 meters. The arches are spaced on 4.8-meter centers. This semicircular structure is supported on 28 reinforced concrete grade beams approximately 1.8 meters wide by 1.2 meters thick (one on each side) 29 that run the full length of Tunnel Number 2. The interior and exterior surfaces of the steel roof are coated 30 with a bituminous coating compound to inhibit corrosion. The entire storage area is covered with 31 2.4 meters of earth fill to serve as shielding. 32 The nominal inside dimensions of Tunnel Number 2 are 514.5 meters long, 7.9 meters high, and 33 10.4 meters wide. However, because of the arch-shaped cross-section of Tunnel Number 2 and entry 34 clearance at the water-fillable door, the usable storage area (width and height above top-of-rail) is 35 6.7 meters high and 5.8 meters wide, the same dimensions as for Tunnel Number 1. The floor consists of 36 a railroad track laid on a gravel bed. The space between ties is filled to top-of-tie with gravel ballast. 37 Commencing at the ends of the 2.4-meter-long ties, the earth floor is sloped upward on a I (vertical) to 38 1 1/2 (horizontal) grade. The tracks are on a 1/10 of 1 percent downgrade slope to the south to ensure the 39 railcars remain in their storage position. A railcar bumper is located 2.4 meters from the south end of the 40 tracks to act as a stop. The capacity of the storage area is 40, 12.8-meter-long railcars. 41 The first railcar was placed in storage in December 1967. Table 3.1 contains an approximate inventory of 42 waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels. 43 3.3.1 Process and Activities 44 The function of the PUREX Tunnels is to store mixed waste until the waste can be processed for final 45 disposal. When waste is to be placed in the storage tunnels, a work plan, describing the overall transfer 46 activities, and a storage tunnel checklist are prepared. The work plan and storage tunnel checklist are 47 routed for review and concurrence by key personnel and forwarded to management for approval. Chapter 3.9

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 3.3.2 Physical Characterization of Material to be Stored 2 Physical characterization of waste includes an evaluation of the following physical properties: 3 * Length, width, and height 4 * Gross weight and volume 5 * Preferred orientation for transport and storage 6 * Presence of dangerous waste constituents 7 Information sources used in physical characterization include equipment fabrication and installation 8 drawings, operational records, and process knowledge. Physical characterization provides information 9 necessary to describe the waste material. Such information also is used to design and fabricate, if 10 required, supports on the railcar. 11 Before removal from service, the equipment could be flushed to minimize loss of products, to reduce 12 contamination, and to reduce dangerous waste constituents present in a residual heel to nonregulated 13 levels. When equipment is flushed, analysis of the rinsate is used to determine when these goals have 14 been achieved. 15 3.4 Identification/Classification and Quantities Of Dangerous Waste Managed Within 16 The PUREX Storage Tunnels 17 Table 3.1 contains an approximation of the total amount of waste stored within the PUREX Storage 18 Tunnels. 19 3.5 Waste Analysis Parameters 20 Analytical requirements were selected based on knowledge required for the safe handling and storage of 21 the waste within the PUREX Storage Tunnels, including any operational compliance issues. 22 3.5.1 Waste Identification 23 A prerequisite step in proper waste management is to address whether waste being considered for 24 management within the PUREX Storage Tunnels falls within the scope of this unit's permit. This 25 includes identifying any dangerous waste in accordance with regulatory and permit requirements and 26 applicability of any land disposal restrictions. 27 This section provides information on how the chemical and physical characteristics of the mixed waste 28 currently stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels were determined so that the waste is stored and managed 29 properly. 30 Regulated material presently stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels contains the following dangerous 31 waste: 32 * Lead 33 * Mercury 34 * Silver and silver salts 35 * Chromium 36 * Cadmium 37 * Barium 38 * Mineral oil Chapter 3.10

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 Storage of non-PUREX Plant waste is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Sampling, chemical analysis, 2 process knowledge (as discussed in the following section), and/or inventory information from waste 3 tracking forms provided from other onsite sources are required to confirm the characteristics and 4 quantities of mixed waste to be stored. Future waste and dangerous constituents might not be in the same 5 configuration or form as described in the following sections. 6 3.5.1.1 Lead 7 Lead stored was used in various capacities during past Hanford Facility operations. Primary functions of 8 lead included use as weights, counterweights, and shielding. Often the lead is encased in steel (carbon or 9 stainless) to facilitate its attachment to various types of equipment. 10 Lead exhibits the characteristic of toxicity as determined by the toxicity characteristics leaching 11 procedure and is designated D008 [WAC 173-303-090(8)]. The quantity of lead present could produce an 12 extract greater than 500 milligrams per liter should the lead be exposed to a leachate. However, because 13 the bulk of the lead is encased in steel, is stored inside a weather-tight structure, and is elevated above 14 floor level on railcars that isolate the lead from other materials stored, the potential for exposure of bare 15 lead to a leachate is considered negligible. 16 Sampling and chemical analysis is not performed on lead associated with the material placed in the 17 PUREX Storage Tunnels. Therefore, the accuracy of the estimate on the amount of lead presently stored 18 in each tunnel is limited to the data available from process knowledge. Counterweights on equipment 19 dunnage and lead used for shielding cannot be quantified by existing historical records and are not 20 included for lead listed on Table 3.1. However, if removed from the tunnels, the material will be 21 examined and any suspect attachments will be removed, evaluated, and disposed of in accordance with 22 established methods. 23 3.5.1.2 Mercury 24 Mercury is contained within thermowells that are an integral part of spent reactor fuel dissolvers used at 25 the PUREX Plant. The dissolvers are large 304L stainless steel process vessels that are approximately 26 2.7 meters in diameter, 7.3 meters tall, and weigh approximately 26,309 kilograms. The outer shell is 27 constructed of a 1-centimeter-thick plate. The dissolvers were used in decladding and dissolving spent 28 reactor fuel in the PUREX Plant. 29 Depending on the specific dissolver in question, 19.1 or 45.4 kilograms of mercury (1.4 or 1.77 liters) 30 were poured in each of the two thermowells per dissolver (38.2 or 90.8 kilograms total per dissolver) 31 following vertical installation of the dissolvers inside the PUREX canyon and before the dissolver was 32 installed in a process cell. The mercury served to transfer heat from the dissolver interior to the 33 thermohm temperature sensor mounted within the thermowell. This mercury remains within the 34 thermowells of discarded dissolvers. In preparation for storage, the thermohms were removed and the 35 upper end of each thermowell was plugged with a 304L stainless steel nozzle plug. In storage, the 36 discarded dissolver rests in an inclined position in a cradle on the railcar. The mercury contained in the 37 thermowells remains in the lower portion of each thermowell and, under normal conditions, is never in 38 contact with the mechanical closure on the nozzle end of the thermowell. 39 Mercury exhibits the characteristic of toxicity as determined by the toxicity characteristics leaching 40 procedure and is designated D009 [WAC 173-303-090(8)]. 41 The potential for mercury to become exposed to leachate is considered negligible. The PUREX Storage 42 Tunnels are designed and constructed as weather-tight structures. Further, the mercury is encased in a 43 stainless steel pipe within a stainless steel vessel that is stored on a railcar above the floor level of the 44 tunnels. Therefore, exposure of the mercury stored in the tunnels to leachate is not considered a credible 45 occurrence. Chapter 3.11

--- Page 1117 ---
WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels I Sampling and chemical analysis is not performed on mercury associated with the dissolvers stored in 2 Tunnel Number 2. The quantity of mercury present in each thermowell is documented on Table 3.1. 3 3.5.1.3 Silver 4 Silver, mostly in the form of silver salts deposited on unglazed ceramic packing, is contained within the 5 discarded silver reactors stored in Tunnel Number 2. The silver reactors were used to remove iodine from 6 the offgas streams of the spent reactor fuel dissolvers. The reactor vessel is approximately 1.4 meters in 7 diameter by 4.1 meters tall and is constructed of 1-centimeter 304L stainless steel. The vessel contains 8 two 1.2-meter-deep beds of packing. Each bed consists of a 30.5-centimeter depth of 2.5-centimeter 9 unglazed ceramic saddles topped with a 0.6-meter depth of 1.3-centimeter unglazed ceramic saddles. The 10 two beds are separated vertically by a distance of about 0.6 meter, and each bed rests on a support made 11 of stainless steel angles and coarse screen. The packing was coated initially with 113.4 kilograms of 12 silver nitrate used for iodine retention. Nozzles on the top of the reactor were provided to allow flushing 13 and/or regeneration of the packing with silver nitrate solution as the need arose. 14 Because of competing reactions, which include conversion of silver nitrate to silver iodide, reduction of 15 silver nitrate to metallic silver, and formation of silver chloride, the packing of a stored silver reactor 16 contains a mixture of silver nitrate, silver halides, and silver fines. 17 Silver salts exhibit the characteristics of toxicity as determined by the toxicity characteristics leaching 18 procedure and are designated DOI 1 [WAC 173-303-090(8)]. Silver salts exhibit the characteristic of 19 ignitability and are designated as DOOI [WAC 173-303-090(5)]. 20 The potential of silver, including silver salts, stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels to become exposed to 21 leachate is considered negligible. Silver is contained within a stainless steel vessel, stored inside a 22 weather-tight structure, and elevated above floor level on a railcar. Therefore, exposure of the silver 23 stored in the tunnels to leachate is not considered a credible occurrence. In addition, the contained silver 24 is isolated from contact with any combustibles; therefore, the possibility of ignition is considered 25 extremely remote. 26 Provisions for taking samples of the packing were not provided in the design of the vessels. Therefore, 27 sampling and chemical analysis are not performed for silver salts before placing a silver reactor in 28 storage. However, for accountability, the total silver content (Table 3.1) is considered silver nitrate, the 29 salt that exhibits the characteristics of both ignitability and toxicity. 30 The quantity of silver salts contained within a discarded silver reactor is a function of silver nitrate 31 regeneration history. Operating records (process knowledge) of regenerations and flushes are used to 32 estimate the total accumulation of silver within each reactor. 33 3.5.1.4 Chromium 34 Presently, chromium stored in Tunnel Number 2 is contained within a failed concentrator removed from 35 the PUREX Plant, and within stainless steel containers received from the 324 Building. The concentrator 36 is a vertical tube structure that was used to concentrate aqueous streams from the final uranium cycle, 37 final plutonium cycles, final neptunium cycles, and condensate from the acid recovery system for recycle. 38 Following service, the concentrator was inspected and found to contain silicate solids with high levels of 39 chromium from the corrosion of stainless steel. The existence of chromium within the 324 Building 40 waste was determined through process knowledge. Chromium exhibits the characteristic of toxicity as 41 determined by the toxicity characteristics leaching procedure and is designated D007 42 [WAC 173-303-090(8)]. The potential for the chromium stored in Tunnel Number 2 to become exposed 43 to leachate is considered negligible. Tunnel Number 2, is designed and constructed to be weather-tight. 44 Further, the chromium is encased within stainless steel vessels and containers that are stored on railcars 45 above the floor level of the tunnel. Therefore, exposure of the chromium stored in the tunnel to leachate 46 is not considered a credible occurrence. Chapter 3.12

--- Page 1118 ---
WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 The quantity of chromium within the concentrator was estimated by calculating the volume of silicate 2 solids and the percentage of chromium within the silicate solids. The quantity of chromium in the 3 324 Building waste was based on process knowledge. 4 3.5.1.5 Cadmium 5 Presently, cadmium stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnel Number 2 is associated with shielding and with 6 a dissolver moderator removed from the PUREX Plant, and within stainless steel containers received 7 from the 324 Building. The cadmium was used to shield equipment and consists of sheets of the metal 8 attached to lead, both of which could be encased in steel. The cadmium received from the 324 Building 9 was used in waste technology research and development programs. 10 The dissolvers are annular vessels that are geometrically favorable for criticality safety. The dissolvers 11 were placed over cadmium lined (neutron absorbers) moderators for additional criticality safety. The 12 moderator is a centrally located, cylindrical, cadmium-jacketed 0.08-centimeter-thick concrete 13 15.2-centimeter-thick neutron absorber. The moderators are approximately 4.4 meters tall by 14 approximately 1.5 meters outer diameter. 15 Cadmium exhibits the characteristic of toxicity as determined by the toxicity characteristics leaching 16 procedure and is designated D006 [WAC 173-303-090(8)]. If exposed to a leachate, the quantity of 17 cadmium present could produce an extract having a concentration of greater than or equal to 1 milligram 18 per liter, but less than 100 milligrams per liter; therefore, the mixed waste is managed as a WTO2 19 [WAC 173-303-100(5)]. 20 The potential for the cadmium stored in Tunnel Number 2 to become exposed to leachate is considered 21 negligible. Tunnel Number 2 is designed and constructed to be weather-tight. Further, the cadmium is 22 stored on railcars above the floor level of the tunnel. Therefore, exposure of the cadmium stored in the 23 tunnel to leachate is not considered a credible occurrence. 24 3.5.1.6 Barium 25 Presently, barium is stored in Tunnel Number 2 in stainless steel containers received from the 26 324 Building. The waste was generated during numerous research and development programs conducted 27 in B-Cell of the Waste Technology Engineering Laboratory (324 Building). The existence of barium 28 within the 324 Building waste was determined through process knowledge. 29 Barium exhibits the characteristic of toxicity as determined by the toxicity characteristics leaching 30 procedure and is designated D005 [WAC 173-303-090(8)]. 31 The potential for barium stored in Tunnel Number 2 to become exposed to leachate is considered 32 negligible. Tunnel Number 2 is designed and constructed to be weather-tight. Further, the barium is 33 encased in steel containers stored on a railcar above the floor level of the tunnel. Therefore, exposure of 34 the barium stored in the tunnel to leachate is not considered a credible occurrence. 35 3.5.1.7 Mineral Oil 36 Presently, mineral oil is stored in Tunnel Number 2 in stainless steel containers received from the 37 324 Building. The mineral oil was used in the B-Cell viewing windows in the 324 Building. Oil leaking 38 from the windows was absorbed on rags and clay absorbent material. 39 The material safety data sheet for the mineral oil lists a lethal dose (LD50) of 2 grams per kilogram 40 (dermal rabbit). Therefore, the oil designates as a Toxic Category A WTO2 [WAC 173-303-100(5)]. 41 The potential for the absorbed mineral oil stored in Tunnel Number 2 to become exposed to leachate is 42 considered negligible. Tunnel Number 2 is designed and constructed to be weather-tight. Further, the 43 mineral oil is encased in steel containers stored on a railcar above the floor level of the tunnel. Therefore, 44 exposure of the mineral oil stored in the tunnel to leachate is not considered a credible occurrence. Chapter 3.13

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 3.5.1.8 Identification of Incompatible Waste 2 The next step is to ensure that sufficient information concerning the waste has been provided so the waste 3 can be managed properly. This includes identifying incompatible waste. These safety issues primarily 4 are related to prevention of unwanted chemical reactions that could create a catastrophic situation, such as 5 a fire, an explosion, or a large chemical release. 6 3.5.1.9 Operational Considerations 7 Sufficient information must be available to ensure that incoming waste meets operational acceptance 8 limits, e.g., physical size, ALARA concerns, and WAC 173-303 requirements. These operating 9 specifications are limits and controls imposed on a process or operation that, if violated, could jeopardize 10 the safety of personnel, and could damage equipment, facilities, or the environment. Operating 11 specifications have been established from operating experience, process knowledge, and calculations. 12 3.5.2 Parameter and Rationale Selection Process 13 This WAP describes the process to ensure that the dangerous waste components of the material stored in 14 the tunnels are properly characterized and designated so that dangerous and mixed waste is managed 15 properly. 16 The parameters considered for waste designation under WAC 173-303-070(3) and the rationale for there 17 application is discussed in the following sections. 18 3.5.2.1 Discarded Chemical Products 19 The first category of dangerous waste designation is "Discarded Chemical Products" 20 (WAC 173-303-081). The waste stored in the tunnels does not fit the definitions in WAC 173-303-081 21 for a discarded chemical product. Therefore, the waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is not 22 designated as a discarded chemical product. 23 3.5.2.2 Dangerous Waste Sources 24 The second category of dangerous waste designation is "Dangerous Waste Sources" (WAC 173-303-082). 25 The waste stored in the tunnels is not listed on the "Dangerous Waste Sources List" 26 (WAC 173-303-9904). Therefore, the waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is not designated as a 27 dangerous waste source. 28 3.5.2.3 Dangerous Waste Characteristics 29 The third category of dangerous waste designation is "Dangerous Waste Characteristics" 30 (WAC 173-303-090). The characteristics are as follows. 31 * Characteristic of Ignitability -Although the solid silver nitrate has not been tested in accordance 32 with Appendix F of 49 CFR 173, the waste is assumed to be an oxidizer as specified in 33 49 CFR 173.127(a). Therefore, the silver nitrate waste is assumed to exhibit the characteristic of 34 ignitability under WAC 173-303-090(5) and is designated as D001. 35 * Characteristic of Corrosivity -Some of the material stored within the tunnels either has contained 36 or has been in contact with corrosive liquids. The standard operating procedure has been to flush 37 vessels with water to recover as much special nuclear material as practical. In addition, flushing 38 removes much of the mixed waste contamination, minimizing the spread of contamination during 39 handling. Currently, the final aqueous rinse is sampled and analyzed to confirm that the pH is 40 greater than 2 and less than 12.5. Therefore, the waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is 41 not designated as corrosive waste. Chapter 3.14

--- Page 1120 ---
WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 * Characteristic of Reactivity -The waste stored in the tunnels does not meet any of the definitions 2 of reactivity as defined in WAC 173-303-090(7). The waste material is not unstable, does not 3 react violently with water, does not form explosive mixtures, or does not generate toxic gases. 4 Therefore, the waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is not designated as reactive waste. 5 * Characteristic of Toxicity -Lead, mercury, silver, chromium, barium, and cadmium are identified 6 on the Toxicity Characteristics list. The quantity of these materials stored in the tunnels is 7 sufficient that, should the substances come in contact with a leachate (an event considered 8 unlikely), the concentration of the extract could be above the limits identified in the list. 9 Therefore, this waste is designated D005, D006, D007, D008, D009, and DOI 1. 10 The PUREX Storage Tunnels also are permitted for selenium (DO10). Currently, there is no waste stored 11 in the tunnels that is designated for DOI; however, there is a potential for waste with this waste number 12 to be stored within the tunnels. 13 3.5.2.4 Dangerous Waste Criteria 14 The fourth category of dangerous waste designation is "Dangerous Waste Criteria" (WAC 173-303-100). 15 The criteria are as follows: 16 * Toxicity Criteria- Cadmium meets the toxicity criteria in WAC 173-303-100(5) when 17 performing a book designation. Because of the concentrations present, the waste containing these 18 constituents is designated as dangerous waste (DW) and is assigned the dangerous waste number 19 of WT02. 20 * Persistence Criteria -Currently, no waste stored in the tunnels has been designated as persistent 21 per WAC 173-303-100(6). 22 3.5.2.5 Waste Designation Summary 23 The mixed waste currently stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is designated as follows: 24 * Lead -D008; EHW 25 * Mercury -D009; EHW 26 * Silver and silver salts -DOOI, DO11; EHW 27 * Chromium -D007; EHW 28 * Cadmium -D006, WTO2; DW 29 * Barium -D005; EHW 30 * Mineral Oil -WTO2; DW 31 3.5.3 Rationale for Parameter Selection 32 Refer to Section 3.5.2. 33 3.5.4 Special Parameter Selection 34 Refer to Section 3.5.2. 35 3.5.5 Selection of Sampling Procedures 36 The following sections discuss the sampling methods and procedures that will be used. Sampling usually 37 will be in accordance with requirements contained in the pertinent sampling analysis plan, procedures, 38 and/or other documents that specify sampling and analysis parameters. 39 3.5.6 Sampling Strategies 40 The only analysis presently used in support of the PUREX Storage Tunnels operation is a corrosivity 41 check on the final in-place aqueous rinse of discarded vessels before the vessels are released for storage. 42 Chapter 3.15

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 The pH is determined by a pH meter using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Test 2 Method 9040 or 9041 in Test Methods for the Evaluation of Solid Waste: Physical/Chemical Methods 3 (EPA 1986). The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sampling will not be performed on 4 any waste currently stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels. 5 Waste received that is not generated at the PUREX Plant could require sampling strategies associated 6 with this waste that will be developed on a case-by-case basis. 7 Sampling Methods 8 Process knowledge of the characteristics and the quantities of the dangerous waste to be stored in the 9 PUREX Storage Tunnels is considered sufficient to properly designate and manage the stored waste. 10 The waste currently stored in the tunnels is lead, mercury, chromium, cadmium, barium, mineral oil, 11 silver, and silver salts. Sampling and chemical analysis of the lead, mercury, cadmium, barium, mineral 12 oil, or chromium to confirm their presence would not provide additional data beneficial to proper 13 management of the waste and would not comply with ALARA principles. The silver salts are dispersed 14 over a large area on ceramic packing contained within a large stainless steel reactor vessel. 15 Representative sampling of the ceramic packing is not considered to be practical and therefore was not 16 performed. 17 If RCRA sampling is required for operation of the PUREX Storage Tunnels, representative sampling 18 methods referenced in WAC 173-303-110 or some other method approved by the Washington State 19 Department of Ecology (Ecology) will be used. For waste received from other Hanford Facility activities, 20 existing sampling, chemical analysis, and/or process knowledge documentation is used to confirm the 21 characteristics and quantities of mixed waste to be stored. Storage of non-PUREX Facility waste is 22 reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 23 3.5.6.1 Frequency of Analyses 24 Because the dangerous waste components of mixed waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels are 25 stable and will remain undisturbed for a long time, the waste designations and quantities present will 26 remain the same as assigned at the time of storage. Therefore, repeated analysis is not considered 27 necessary to ensure that waste designation data are representative. 28 3.5.7 Selection of Sampling Equipment 29 The only analysis presently used in support of the PUREX Storage Tunnels operation is for corrosivity on 30 the final in-place aqueous rinse of discarded vessels before the vessels are released for storage. The pH is 31 determined by Method 9040 or 9041 (SW-846). The RCRA sampling methods, as referenced in 32 WAC 173-303-110, will not be performed on any waste currently stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels. 33 3.5.8 Maintaining and Decontaminating Field Equipment 34 All RCRA sampling equipment used to collect and transport samples must be free of contamination that 35 could alter test results. Equipment used to obtain and contain samples must be clean. Acceptable 36 cleaning procedures for sample bottles and equipment include, but are not limited to, washing with soap 37 or solvent, and steam cleaning. After cleaning, cleaning residues must be removed from all equipment 38 that could come in contact with the waste. One method to remove these residues would be a solvent 39 (acetone or other suitable solvent) rinse followed by a final rinse with deionized water. Equipment must 40 be cleaned before use for another sampling event. 41 After completion of sampling, equipment should be cleaned as indicated previously. If decontamination 42 of the equipment is not feasible, the sampling equipment should be disposed of properly. Chapter 3.16

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 3.5.9 Sample Preservation and Storage 2 Following RCRA sampling, sample preservation follows methods set forth for the specific analysis 3 identified. Preservation is in accordance with the methods stated in SW-846 or any of the test methods 4 adopted by the Hanford Facility that meet WAC 173-303 requirements. No preservation method will be 5 used when there are ALARA concerns. 6 3.5.10 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Procedures 7 The only test method presently used in support of the PUREX Storage Tunnels operation is a corrosivity 8 check on the final in-place aqueous rinse of discarded vessels before the vessels are released for storage. 9 The RCRA sampling will not be performed on any waste currently stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels. 10 Field duplicates, field blanks, trip blanks, and equipment blanks will not be taken. Split samples could be 11 taken at the request of Ecology. 12 Generally, quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) requirements for sampling will be divided 13 between paperwork requirements, such as chain-of-custody, and sampling and analysis activities. This 14 section addresses sampling QA/QC requirements. Analytical QA/QC is discussed in Section 3.6. 15 A chain-of-custody procedure is required for all sampling identified by this WAP. At a minimum, the 16 chain of custody must include the following: (1) description of waste collected, (2) names and signatures 17 of samplers, (3) date and time of collection and number of containers in the sample, and (4) names and 18 signatures of persons involved in transferring the samples. 19 3.5.11 Health and Safety Protocols 20 The safety and health protocol requirements established for the Hanford Site must be followed for all 21 RCRA sampling activities required by this WAP. 22 3.6 Laboratory Selection and Testing and Analytical Methods 23 This section discusses laboratory selection and the types of acceptable analytical methods for RCRA 24 samples. 25 3.6.1 Laboratory Selection 26 Laboratory selection is limited as only a few laboratories are equipped to handle mixed waste because of 27 the special equipment and procedures that must be used to minimize personnel exposure to mixed waste. 28 Laboratory selection depends on laboratory capability, nature of the sample, timing requirements, and 29 cost. At a minimum, the selected laboratory must have the following: 30 * A comprehensive QA/QC program (both qualitative and quantitative). 31 * Technical analytical expertise. 32 * An effective information management system. 33 These requirements will be met if the selected laboratory follows the pertinent requirements contained in 34 the Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order Action Plan, Section 6.5. The selected 35 laboratory also can meet these requirements by having some other type of QA/QC program as long as 36 equivalent data quality is achieved. 37 3.6.2 Testing and Analytical Methods 38 The testing and analytical methods for corrosivity used by the various onsite analytical laboratories are 39 outlined in SW-846. These methods in some cases deviate from SW-846 and American Society for 40 Testing and Materials-accepted specifications for holding times, sample preservation, and other specific 41 analytical procedures. These deviations are discussed in Analytical Methods for Mixed Waste Analyses 42 at the Hanford Site (DOE/RL-94-97). Chapter 3.17

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 3.7 Waste Re-Evaluation Frequencies 2 Re-evaluation of waste within the PUREX Storage Tunnels will not occur because of the personnel and 3 environmental exposure to mixed waste and the way the railcars are positioned in the tunnels. The waste 4 is expected to remain stable. 5 3.8 Special Procedural Requirements 6 The following sections describe special procedural requirements associated with waste in the PUREX 7 Storage Tunnels. 8 3.8.1 Procedures for Receiving Wastes Generated Offsite 9 The PUREX Storage Tunnels do not accept waste generated off the Hanford Site. 10 3.8.2 Procedures for Ignitable, Reactive, and Incompatible Waste 11 Presently, the only ignitable, reactive, or incompatible dangerous waste stored in the PUREX Storage 12 Tunnels is the silver nitrate coating on the ceramic packing inside the silver reactors. This material is 13 confined to the interior of a large stainless steel vessel (Section 3.5.1.1) that separates this material from 14 all other waste material stored in the tunnel. The requirements in WAC 173-303-395(1)(a) require 15 'No Smoking' signs be conspicuously placed wherever there is a hazard present from ignitable or 16 dangerous waste. 'No Smoking' signs are not considered appropriate at the PUREX Storage Tunnels 17 because of ALARA principles. Smoking is not allowed in any area with ALARA concerns and rules 18 prohibiting smoking are strictly enforced. This policy serves to achieve the no smoking intent of 19 WAC 173-303-395(1)(a), posting and maintaining 'No Smoking' signs are not considered appropriate. 20 Isolated areas within the PUREX Storage Tunnels make periodic inspections inconsistent with ALARA 21 guidelines[e.g., an annual fire inspection as required by WAC 173-303-395(1)(d) for storage areas 22 containing ignitable waste]. Therefore, such inspections are not performed. 23 3.8.3 Provisions for Complying with Land Disposal Restriction Requirements 24 Operation of the PUREX Storage Tunnels does not involve land disposal or treatment of dangerous 25 waste. The information provided by the generating unit regarding land disposal restrictions of dangerous 26 waste is sufficient to operate the PUREX Storage Tunnels in compliance with land disposal restriction 27 requirements. When final disposition of the waste occurs, this information will be passed on for final 28 treatment or disposal of the waste. 29 3.8.4 Deviations from the Requirements of this Plan 30 Management may approve deviations from this plan if special circumstances arise that make this prudent. 31 These deviations must be documented in writing with a copy to be retained by the management. 32 3.9 Recordkeeping 33 Records associated with this waste analysis plan and waste verification program are maintained on the 34 Hanford Facility. These records will be maintained until closure of the PUREX Storage Tunnels. 35 Records associated with the waste inventory will be maintained for 5 years. 36 3.10 References 37 Ecology, EPA, and DOE, 2003, Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order, Washington 38 State Department of Ecology, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S Department of Energy, 39 Richland, Washington, amended periodically. 40 DOE/RL-94-97, Analytical Methods for Mixed Waste Analyses at the Hanford Site, Rev. 0, 41 U.S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office, Richland, Washington. 42 EPA, 1986, Test Methods for the Evaluation of Solid Waste: Physical/Chemical Methods, SW-846, 43 3rd ed., U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C.

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 4.0 PROCESS INFORMATION 2 This chapter discusses the processes involved in the operation of the Plutonium Uranium Extraction 3 Facility (PUREX) Storage Tunnels. The PUREX Storage Tunnels are used for the storage of mixed 4 waste from the PUREX Plant and other onsite sources. 5 The PUREX Storage Tunnels were designed and constructed to provide a means of protecting personnel 6 and the environment from exposure to mixed waste associated with stored material. This design also 7 serves to protect personnel and the environment from the dangerous waste component of the mixed waste 8 stored inside the tunnels. 9 The PUREX Storage Tunnels are being permitted as a miscellaneous unit under Washington 10 Administrative Code (WAC) 173-303-680. The WAC regulations require that miscellaneous unit permit 11 terms and provisions address appropriate requirements provided for other treatment, storage, and disposal 12 (TSD) units. Because the operation and construction of the PUREX Storage Tunnels most closely 13 resemble that of a container storage unit, the appropriate requirements prescribed for a container storage 14 unit are addressed in this chapter. 15 4.1 Operation of the PUREX Storage Tunnels 16 This section describes the selection, characterization, preparation, placement, and removal activities 17 associated with storage of mixed waste in the PUREX Storage Tunnels. 18 4.1.1 Preparation for Tunnel Activities 19 Management, with the concurrence of an appropriate cognizant engineer, determines when material is to 20 be removed and transported to the PUREX Storage Tunnels. A job specific work plan describing the 21 overall transfer activities is prepared. 22 4.1.1.1 Storage/Removal Equipment Preparation 23 A remotely controlled, battery-powered locomotive normally was used to move railcars into and out of 24 the PUREX Storage Tunnels. Other mechanical means such as a standard locomotive or a winch also 25 can be used independently or in combination with the remote locomotive should the need arise. Methods 26 for use of the remote locomotive are described in this chapter as this represents the normal placement and 27 removal of railcars at the PUREX Storage Tunnels. Should storage activities require the use of a 28 mechanical means other than the remote locomotive to place or withdraw a railcar, methods for that 29 application will be developed. 30 Preparatory activities associated with the remote-controlled locomotive included the following: 31 * Charging the batteries for both the locomotive and the radio transmitter. 32 * Performing operational checks. 33 * Installing a plastic shroud over the locomotive to facilitate decontamination. 34 * Installing an anticoupling device on the south coupler of the locomotive (storage only). 35 * Performing physical inspections of the railroad track within the railroad tunnel to ensure that the 36 track switches are positioned properly and the track is clear of obstructions. 37 4.1.1.2 Water-Fillable Door Preparation 38 Each PUREX Storage Tunnel has a water-fillable door that isolates the storage area from the PUREX 39 railroad tunnel. 40 Currently, the water-fillable door to Tunnel Number 2 is empty and is not expected to be filled. 41 Operational checks are performed on the door hoists. Before performing operational checks on the 42 water-fillable door, the operator confirms with a dispatcher that the railroad tunnel area is clear of 43 personnel. Chapter 4.5

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 4.1.1.3 Other Preparation Tasks 2 Before material storage, the following preparatory tasks are completed. 3 * The storage tunnel exhaust fan is verified to be operating. 4 * Labels will be attached to the railcar in accordance with WAC 173-303-395(6) and 5 173-303-630(3) if the material contains dangerous waste components. 6 4.1.2 Tunnel Storage Activities 7 This section describes the placement of material within the PUREX Storage Tunnels. 8 4.1.2.1 Physical Characterization of Material to be Stored 9 Physical characterization includes an evaluation of the following physical properties: 10 * Length, width, and height. 11 * Gross weight and volume. 12 * Preferred orientation for transport and storage. 13 * Presence of mixed waste. 14 Information sources used in physical characterization include equipment fabrication and installation 15 drawings, operational records, and process knowledge. Physical characterization provides information 16 necessary to appropriately describe the mixed waste materials. Such information also is used to design 17 and fabricate, if required, supports on the railcar. 18 Specific material known to contain constituents that would cause the equipment to be designated as 19 mixed waste is discussed in the waste analysis plan (Chapter 3.0). The material includes but is not 20 limited to dissolvers that contain elemental mercury; silver reactors that contain silver salts; jumpers and 21 other equipment that have elemental lead counterweights; a concentrator that contains chromium; 22 neutron absorbing equipment containing cadmium. Characteristics of these materials when stored as 23 mixed waste are described in Chapter 3.0. Waste transferred to the PUREX Storage Tunnels from other 24 than PUREX Plant also would be physically characterized. 25 4.1.2.2 Material Flushing 26 Before removal from service, the material from the PUREX Plant was flushed to minimize loss of 27 products, to reduce contamination, and to reduce to nonregulatory levels the concentration of any 28 dangerous chemicals present in a residual heel. In the future the analysis of the rinsate will be used to 29 determine when these goals have been achieved. The analysis of the final flush will be retained as part of 30 the PUREX Storage Tunnel records. Material removed from other onsite units will be prepared for 31 transfer to the tunnels in accordance with this dangerous waste permit. 32 4.1.2.3 Railcar Preparation 33 Railcars are modified to serve as dedicated storage platforms and transporters for material placed in the 34 PUREX Storage Tunnels. The wooden decking on the railcars is removed to minimize the amount of 35 combustible material placed in the PUREX Storage Tunnels. The south coupler is disabled or removed 36 to prevent the railcar from coupling to the railcar stored ahead. Brakes are disabled to ensure 37 freewheeling of the railcar. Steel decking, catch pans filled with absorbent, and equipment cradles are 38 provided as needed to modify the railcar for its specific task. 39 4.1.2.4 Placement of Material into Storage Position 40 With all preparations complete and with the approval of cognizant management, transferring material to 41 the PUREX Storage Tunnels proceeds as follows. Chapter 4.6

--- Page 1135 ---
WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 * The water-fillable door to the storage tunnel is opened. 2 * The railcar is loaded as specified in the storage tunnel checklist. 3 * An inventory of items loaded on the railcar and a record of their location on the railcar are 4 recorded in the storage tunnel checklist. 5 * A survey is obtained of the loaded railcar at a distance commensurate with ALARA practices. 6 * The railcar is pushed into the storage tunnel to its storage position. 7 * Once the railcar is in position, the water-fillable door is closed. 8 4.1.3 Removal of Stored Material 9 Removal of material stored within the PUREX Storage Tunnels is not conducted routinely. It is planned 10 that the material will remain in storage until a means to accommodate processing and repackaging of the 11 material for disposal or further storage or until another final disposition option becomes available. 12 Removal of material from storage within the PUREX Storage Tunnels would proceed after the 13 preparation activities identified in Section 4.1.1. 14 With all preparations complete and approval of management, removal of material from the storage area 15 of the PUREX Storage Tunnels would proceed as follows. 16 * The equipment that will be used to remove material is positioned in the PUREX railroad tunnel. 17 * Verification is made that the PUREX railroad tunnel is configured properly to proceed with 18 entrance into the PUREX Storage Tunnels (i.e., tunnel ventilation system is operating, the 19 overhead door is closed and a survey of the area is performed for as low as reasonably achievable 20 [ALARA] concems). 21 * The water-fillable door is opened. 22 * The equipment that will be used to remove material is moved into the storage tunnel and 23 connected to the railcar. 24 * Verification is made that the railcar is connected to the removal equipment and the railcar is 25 extracted from the storage tunnel and positioned within the PUREX railroad tunnel. 26 * The water-fillable door is closed. 27 The loaded railcar retrieved from the tunnel would be remotely viewed and measurements may be 28 obtained to determine the possibility of mixed waste containment failure during storage in the PUREX 29 Storage Tunnels. If evidence of containment failure is detected, the specific details (i.e., material, 30 location on railcar, storage position) would be documented and attached to the waste tracking form. This 31 information would be maintained in the files and would be used to establish sampling locations within 32 the tunnels at closure. After remote viewing and surveying, the railcar and associated material may be 33 prepared as required for transfer to an appropriate onsite TSD unit for treatment or further storage. 34 4.1.4 Filling the Water-Fillable Door (Tunnel Number 2) 35 If shielding beyond that provided by the empty water-fillable door becomes necessary, the door can be 36 filled with water. In the past, this was accomplished by connecting a fire hose from the water hydrant to 37 the wall stub on the exterior of the door housing (Figure 4.1). Once the fire hose was in place, the 38 hydrant valve was opened and the door was filled with water. 39 The hydrant was closed by personnel when a high-level indicator light illuminated. Although attendance 40 by an operator is required at all times during filling operations, should the door overfill, excess water is 41 channeled through a vent/spill pipe to the door sump. A 15.2-centimeter drain is provided in each door 42 sump. Water accumulated in the door sump was pumped out to the Double-Shell Tank System, and the 43 sump and drain were made inoperable during PUREX Facility deactivation activities. Chapter 4.7

--- Page 1136 ---
WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels I The drain was sealed during PUREX Facility deactivation. In the future, a temporary source of water 2 could be provided for filling the water-fillable door. 3 4.1.5 Post Storage Activities 4 The following post storage activities would conclude the tunnel storage task. 5 * Decontamination activities, if required, are performed. 6 * Management is notified of any unusual conditions observed during the storage/retrieval 7 activities. 8 4.1.6 Operation of the Tunnel Ventilation System 9 The ventilation systems for Tunnel Number I and Tunnel Number 2 were designed to ventilate air from 10 within the tunnels so the airborne contamination is vented through a High Efficiency Particulate Air 11 (HEPA) filtered exhaust system. 12 4.1.6.1 Tunnel Number 1 Ventilation 13 Active ventilation of Tunnel Number I presently is not provided. After placement of the last railcar into 14 Tunnel Number 1, the tunnel was sealed (Chapter 2.0). As part of the sealing activities, the ventilation 15 fan was deactivated electrically and the exhaust stack and filter were isolated from the system by 16 installing blanks upstream and downstream of both the exhaust fan and filter and the stack was removed. 17 In the event railcar removal activities are initiated, it is planned that the ventilation system would be 18 reactivated. Operation of the ventilation system would be similar to that for Tunnel Number 2. 19 4.1.6.2 Tunnel Number 2 Ventilation 20 The Tunnel Number 2 ventilation system presently is inactive. As part of PUREX Facility deactivation, 21 the water-fillable door and outer PUREX railroad tunnel door were sealed. The seal may be temporary or 22 permanent depending on the future need for storing waste in the tunnel. The ventilation system may be 23 operated continuously, or de-energized and reactivated during waste placement activities. During 24 deactivation, a blank was installed on the downstream side of the filter and the stack was capped. When 25 the determination has been made that Tunnel Number 2 will no longer receive waste, the ventilation 26 system will be blanked and deactivated electrically similar to the Tunnel Number I ventilation system. 27 While the Tunnel Number 2 ventilation system is operating and the water-fillable door is closed, the 28 exhaust system, which discharges approximately 100 cubic meters per minute, maintains a slightly 29 negative pressure in the tunnel. The exhaust air is replaced by infiltration around the water-fillable door 30 and through the porosity of the tunnel structure (e.g., the rail-bed ballast). When the water-fillable door 31 is open (during transfer activities), inward airflow is maintained through the open doorway. This inward 32 airflow channels airborne radioactive contamination away from both the railroad tunnel and personnel 33 following railcars (if allowed) into the storage tunnel. A HEPA filter provides filtration of all exhaust air 34 before release to the atmosphere. When the ventilation system is operating, the HEPA filter is tested in 35 place at least annually to ensure radioactive particulate removal efficiency. Exhausted air is sampled 36 periodically and analyzed for airborne radionuclides. 37 4.2 Containers 38 This section describes the various types of containment used to isolate mixed waste stored in the PUREX 39 Storage Tunnels. The PUREX Storage Tunnels are considered to be a miscellaneous unit most closely 40 resembling that of a container storage unit. The mixed waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is 41 contained and is not considered a risk to human health or to the environment. 42 4.2.1 Containers with Free Liquids 43 The only mixed waste stored as a free liquid is elemental mercury. A small quantity, less than 1.7 liters, 44 of mercury is contained in each of the two thermowells attached to and contained within each dissolver 45 (Chapter 3.0). Chapter 4.8

--- Page 1137 ---
WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels I Primary containment of the mercury is provided by the all-welded construction of the thermowell itself, 2 which is fabricated from 7.6-centimeter, Schedule 80, 304L stainless steel pipe. The open upper end of 3 the thermowell was plugged with a 304L stainless steel nozzle plug in preparation for storage. The 4 dissolver rests on a cradle on its railcar in an inclined position. This ensures that the mercury remains in 5 the lower portion of the thermowell and is not in contact with the mechanical closure on the nozzle end 6 of the thermowell. 7 A secondary containment barrier for mercury, should it leak from the thermowell, is provided by the 8 dissolver itself. The dissolver is a 304L stainless steel process vessel constructed from 9 1-centimeter-thick plate and is approximately 2.7 meters in diameter. The dissolver is of all-welded 10 construction and contains no drains or nozzle outlets in the bottom several feet of its lower section, which 11 contains both thermowells. 12 The 304L stainless steel used to contain the elemental mercury is both compatible with the waste itself 13 and the storage environment. The potential for significant deterioration of either the primary or 14 secondary containment barrier material before closure is considered to be negligible. 15 The dissolvers stored within the PUREX Storage Tunnels are not labeled as containing characteristic 16 toxic mercury (D009) rWAC 173-303-090(8)(c)]. Procedures for labeling were not in place at the time 17 of storage. Personnel access into the storage area for purposes such as labeling is not feasible and cannot 18 be justified under ALARA guidelines. Based on ALARA, mixed waste presently within the PUREX 19 Storage Tunnels will remain unlabeled. However, during future transfers of mixed waste into the 20 PUREX Storage Tunnels the railcars will be labeled as specified by WAC 173-303-395(6) and 21 WAC 173-303-630(3). 22 4.2.2 Containers without Free Liquids that do not Exhibit Ignitability or Reactivity 23 Most lead is fully contained in all-welded encasements of either carbon steel or 304L stainless steel 24 (refer to Chapter 3.0, Table 1). The encasement serves as support, protection against mechanical 25 damage, and protection of the lead from exposure to the environment. Also, lead has been placed in 26 burial boxes of appropriate size. The boxes provide secondary containment for the lead in the unlikely 27 event the primary encasement should fail. Although boxes may be open on the top, the PUREX Storage 28 Tunnels are enclosed; therefore, the containers are protected from the elements. 29 Both carbon steel and 304L stainless steel used to encase the lead are compatible with the waste and the 30 storage environment. Significant deterioration of either the primary or secondary containment barrier 31 materials before closure is not considered to be credible. 32 In the past, material that contains lead or that has encased lead attached was not labeled as containing 33 characteristic toxic lead (D008) [WAC 173-303-090(8)], because the requirements were not yet on line. 34 As stated in Section 4.2.1, personnel entry into the tunnel storage area for purposes of labeling would be 35 inconsistent with ALARA guidelines. However, during future storage of material containing lead the 36 railcars will be labeled in accordance with WAC 173-303-395(6) and WAC 173-303-630(3). 37 4.2.3 Protection of Extremely Hazardous Waste in Containers 38 The present amount of mixed waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is sufficient to characterize 39 this material as extremely hazardous waste. Because the PUREX Storage Tunnels are enclosed totally, 40 protective covering from the elements and from run-on is provided for the storage of extremely 41 hazardous waste. Periodic inspection of the equipment stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is not 42 feasible and cannot be justified under ALARA guidelines. Safe management of this waste is based on 43 the following considerations. 44 * The operation of the PUREX Storage Tunnels is passive, i.e., once a storage position is filled, the 45 storage position remains undisturbed until closure. Chapter 4.9

--- Page 1138 ---
WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels I * The extremely hazardous waste is compatible with its storage container and the storage 2 environment. 3 4.2.4 Prevention of Reaction of Ignitable, Reactive, and Incompatible Waste in 4 Containers 5 There is no reactive or incompatible waste known to be stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels. The only 6 mixed waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels considered an ignitable waste is the silver nitrate in 7 Tunnel Number 2. The silver nitrate fraction of the silver salts, within the silver reactors, exhibits the 8 characteristic of ignitability as defined in 49 CFR 173.127(a). Therefore, the silver salts are managed as 9 an ignitable dangerous waste in accordance with WAC 173-303-395. 10 * The risk of fire associated with the storage of silver nitrate in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is 11 considered to be extremely low. This conclusion is based on the following considerations. 12 * The operation of the PUREX Storage Tunnels is passive; i.e., once a storage position is filled, the 13 storage position remains undisturbed until closure. 14 * The silver nitrate is contained within large, heavy-walled stainless steel vessels that isolate the 15 silver nitrate from contact with any combustibles that might be in the tunnels. 16 * The silver nitrate is dispersed over a large surface area on a ceramic packing substraight and is 17 not conducive to build-up of heat that could lead to spontaneous combustion. 18 * Personnel access to the occupied areas of the tunnels is not permitted, thereby precluding 19 activities that could present a fire hazard (e.g., smoking, flame cutting, welding, grinding, and 20 other electrical activities). 21 Although ignitable waste storage units are required by WAC 173-303-395(l)(d) to have inspections 22 conducted at least yearly by a fire marshall or professional fire inspector familiar with the requirements 23 of the uniform fire code, the ALARA concerns within the PUREX Storage Tunnels make such 24 inspections impractical. These inspections are not considered appropriate or necessary for the safe 25 operation of the unit because of the nature of the ignitable waste, the means of storage, and ALARA 26 concerns (Chapter 6.0, §6.2). 27 4.3 Engineering Drawings 28 As-built drawings for the PUREX Storage Tunnels: H-2-55587 218-E-14 Structural Floor Plan and Section H-2-55588 Structural Sections and Details: Disposal Facility for Failed Equipment H-2-55589 Structural Sections and Details: Disposal Facility for Failed Equipment H-2-55590 Door and Hoist Details H-2-55591 Door and Hoist Details H-2-55592 Door and Hoist Details H-2-55593 Electrical Details H-2-55594 Shielding Door Fill and Drain Lines Arrangement: Disposal Facility for Failed Equipment H-2-55599 Electrical Door Control Plan, Elementary Diagram and Miscellaneous Details: Disposal Facility for Failed PUREX Equipment H-2-58134 Ventilation Details; Sheet 1, Sheet 2, Sheet 3, Sheet 4 H-2-58175 PUREX Tunnel Chapter 4.10

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 11.0 CLOSURE AND FINANCIAL ASSURANCE 2 Closure of the Plutonium Uranium Extraction Facility (PUREX) Storage Tunnels requires coordination 3 with closure of the PUREX Plant to ensure a cost effective closure for both units. In addition, the nature 4 of the mixed waste located within the PUREX Plant and PUREX Storage Tunnels precludes the 5 determination of the type of treatment and/or disposition of the waste at this time. 6 The PUREX Storage Tunnels will be managed as a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) 7 storage unit until closure can be coordinated with the final closure plan for the PUREX Plant. The 8 PUREX Storage Tunnels closure plan will be submitted after any required National Environmental 9 Policy Act of 1969 documentation and land usage agreements, which initiate disposition and aid in 10 identifying or developing necessary disposition activities, have been adopted. The PUREX Storage 11 Tunnels closure plan will be submitted for the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) 12 approval with the PUREX Plant closure plan. 13 The PUREX Storage Tunnels closure plan will be written to meet the requirements of Washington 14 Administrative Code (WAC) 173-303-140 and WAC 173-303-610. This closure plan might consider but 15 will not be limited to the following options for either in situ disposal or retrieval/clean closure of this 16 unit. 17 Federal facilities are not required to comply with WAC 173-303-620 as is stated in the regulations and as 18 described in Hanford Facility RCRA Permit, WA7890008967 (Permit) Condition II.H.3. 19 11.1 In Situ Disposal Options 20 This closure plan might consider but will not be limited to the following options for in situ disposal of 21 waste in this unit. 22 11.1.1 Backfilling the PUREX Storage Tunnels with Gravel 23 This option could involve backfilling the tunnels with gravel to eliminate void space and prevent ground 24 subsidence. A modified commercially available centrifugal rock-throwing device could be placed in 25 newly constructed risers evenly spaced along each tunnel roof. Fill material could be supplied and 26 dispersed into the tunnels by automated controls. Following the fill process, all equipment could be 27 removed from the tunnel roofs and all means of access to the tunnels could be permanently sealed. Final 28 activities could involve the construction of a final surface barrier that meets RCRA landfill cover 29 requirements to prevent water from leaching mixed waste contained in the tunnels. 30 11.1.2 Injecting the PUREX Storage Tunnels with Grout 31 This option could involve the injection of grout material into each tunnel to stabilize and immobilize 32 contained materials and prevent ground subsidence. A grout injector could be alternately placed in 33 newly constructed risers evenly spaced along each tunnel roof. Grout material could be supplied and 34 dispersed into the tunnels by automated controls. The grout material could be injected in lifts to 35 accommodate curing and heat dissipation normally associated with the use of this type of material. Final 36 activities could involve the construction of a final surface barrier that meets RCRA landfill cover 37 requirements to prevent water from leaching mixed waste contained in the tunnels. 38 11.1.3 Combination of Grout Injection and Backfilling 39 This option combines grout injection with gravel backfilling similar to the processes discussed 40 previously. Grout could be injected first to fill void spaces under the railcars and provide a basal 41 structure. Gravel could be dispersed to fill remaining void space and prevent ground subsidence. Final 42 activities could involve the construction of a final surface barrier that meets RCRA landfill cover 43 requirements to prevent water from leaching mixed waste contained in the tunnels.

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 11.2 Retrieval/Clean Closure Options 2 This closure plan might consider but will not be limited to the following options for retrieval/clean 3 closure of this unit. 4 11.2.1 Retrieval and Disposal in the PUREX Plant 5 Railcars stored in both tunnels could be remotely retrieved one at a time and moved beneath the 6 horizontal door of the railroad tunnel extension for remote viewing, and if possible, characterization. 7 Transfer procedures could be initiated to move waste material from the railcars to the PUREX Plant 8 canyon deck area. Following transfer of the waste material, the railcars could be decontaminated and 9 removed for final disposition at other onsite units. Final disposition of the waste transferred to the 10 canyon deck area could be in accordance with PUREX Plant closure documentation. The PUREX 11 Storage Tunnels could be closed after submittal and implementation of a PUREX Storage Tunnels 12 closure plan in conjunction with PUREX Plant closure documentation. The PUREX Storage Tunnels 13 closure plan will detail verification sampling and analysis to be performed as a part of closure activities. 14 11.2.2 Retrieval and Physical Processing (size reduction) in the PUREX Plant and 15 Subsequent Disposal 16 Retrieval of waste material stored in the tunnels could be similar to that described in the previous section. 17 Once the waste material was transferred to the PUREX Plant canyon deck area, characterization and size 18 reduction of waste material could proceed. An area located on the canyon deck or in a process cell could 19 be modified to include all necessary equipment to perform characterization and size reduction activities. 20 Size reduction could be performed through various technologies that include, but are not limited to, flame 21 cutting, water jet cutting, sawing, or other technologies. Final disposition of the processed waste 22 material either onsite or offsite could be in accordance with regulations and procedures in place at that 23 time. The PUREX Storage Tunnels could be closed after submittal and implementation of a PUREX 24 Storage Tunnels closure plan in conjunction with PUREX Plant closure documentation. The PUREX 25 Storage Tunnels closure plan will detail verification sampling and analysis to be performed as a part of 26 closure activities. 27 11.2.3 Construction of a New Facility for Retrieval, Processing, and Treatment of 28 Equipment for Disposal 29 This option involves the construction of a new unit that is either mobile or stationary to excavate, 30 retrieve, and treat waste material stored in the tunnels. The unit could be constructed in a manner 31 consistent with the retrieval and handling requirements for large, contaminated waste material. 32 Following retrieval, the waste material could be treated in accordance with final onsite or offsite 33 disposition requirements identified at such time. The excavated tunnels could have a temporary surface 34 barrier placed in position until verification and sampling analysis could be performed as a part of closure 35 activities to be performed in conjunction with PUREX Plant closure.

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels I F. PREPARDENESS AND PREVENTION 2 F.1 Preparedness and Prevention Requirements 3 This addendum discusses preparedness and prevention measures for the Plutonium Uranium Extraction 4 Facility (PUREX) Storage Tunnels. 5 F.1.1 Equipment Requirements 6 The following sections describe the internal and external communications systems and emergency 7 equipment required. 8 F.1.1.1 Internal Communications 9 The PUREX Storage Tunnels are not occupied and personnel entry is allowed only on a very limited basis 10 and under close supervision. Normal and emergency communications equipment (portable two-way 11 radios) is available for use. 12 F.1.1.2 External Communications 13 External communications equipment for summoning emergency assistance from the Hanford Fire 14 Department and/or emergency response teams are provided by two-way portable radios or other devices. 15 F.1.1.3 Emergency Equipment 16 Equipment included in the emergency plan for the PUREX Storage Tunnels is provided in Addendum J. 17 F.1.1.4 Water for Fire Control 18 The fire hazard associated with the operation of the PUREX Storage Tunnels is considered to be very low 19 because of the minimal amount of combustibles stored within the tunnels and the lack of an ignition 20 source. In the event it is determined there is a fire in the storage area of the tunnels, the contingency plan 21 will be activated. Because of the potential of the mixed waste stored within the tunnels to leach, the use 22 of water for fire control will be avoided if possible. Reductions of the air supply to the storage area by 23 isolation of the tunnel exhaust system, if operating, should permit the fire to self-extinguish. Should the 24 fire continue to propagate, heavy equipment and cranes will be called to the scene to cover areas of the 25 tunnels that might collapse. Heavy equipment and cranes are readily available on the Hanford Facility at 26 all times and generally are available for deployment to the scene of an emergency within 1 hour. In the 27 event that a fire resulted in the collapse of the tunnels, a recovery plan will be developed in accordance 28 with emergency response procedures included in Addendum J. The recovery plan will take into 29 consideration plans, if any, for retrieval of the waste stored within the tunnel(s). 30 F.1.2 Aisle Space Requirement 31 Requirements for aisle space are not considered appropriate for the safe operation of the PUREX Storage 32 Tunnels and were not included in design documents. 33 F.2 Preventive Procedures, Structures, and Equipment 34 The following sections describe preventive procedures, structures, and equipment. 35 F.2.1 Unloading Operations 36 Operation of the PUREX Storage Tunnels does not involve the loading or unloading of dangerous waste. 37 All loading and unloading operations are conducted at the PUREX Facility or other onsite units. 38 Therefore, the requirements of WAC 173-303-806(4)(a)(viii)(A) are not applicable to the PUREX 39 Storage Tunnels.

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 F.2.2 Runoff 2 The design of the PUREX Storage Tunnels included consideration and provisions for the control of runoff 3 and run-on. Construction of both tunnels included the application of a moisture barrier before placement 4 of the soil overburden. On Tunnel Number 1, 40.8-kilogram mineral surface roofing was applied to the 5 external surfaces of the structural timbers (top and sides). The roofing material was nailed in place with 6 an overlap of approximately 10 centimeters at all joints and seams. All interior and exterior steel surfaces 7 of Tunnel Number 2 were coated with at least a 0.9-millimeter bituminous, solvent coal tar base, coating 8 compound. The coating was applied using a two coat system, with each coat not less than 9 0.45 millimeters, ensuring a total dry film thickness of not less than 0.9 millimeter. 10 The soil overburden covering the PUREX Storage Tunnels also is contoured to provide a side slope of 11 2 (horizontal) to 1 (vertical). This construction serves to divert any seasonal or unanticipated run-on 12 away from the storage area of the PUREX Storage Tunnels. For potential situations where a natural 13 catastrophic event occurs, inspections of the tunnel side slopes are conducted to ensure the contours 14 remain in a condition that ensures proper runoff and continues to divert run-on away from the tunnel 15 storage areas. 16 Run-on at the PUREX Storage Tunnels is controlled by the design features of the exterior of the tunnels 17 that serve to divert run-on away from the interior of the tunnels. Additionally, all waste within the tunnels 18 is stored well above the floor level on railcars. The control of run-on combined with the storage of all 19 waste above the floor elevation provides adequate assurance that runoff will not occur at the PUREX 20 Storage Tunnels. 21 F.2.3 Water Supplies 22 Water was supplied to the PUREX Storage Tunnels from the PUREX Plant. This water was used for the 23 sole purpose of filling the water-fillable doors should it have been determined necessary. There are no 24 other sources or uses of water at the PUREX Storage Tunnels. The line that supplied water to the 25 PUREX Storage Tunnels was blanked and emptied during deactivation activities. In the future, a 26 temporary source of water would be provided for filling the water fillable door. 27 F.2.4 Equipment and Power Failures 28 The procedures, structures, and equipment used to mitigate the effects of equipment failure and power 29 outage are described in the following sections. 30 F.2.4.1 Mitigation of the Effects of Equipment Failure 31 Maintaining safe storage of materials in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is not contingent on continued 32 operation of equipment. The operable equipment associated with the PUREX Storage Tunnels were the 33 remote controlled locomotive or waste placement and removal equipment, the railcars, and the water- 34 fillable door and ventilation system for both tunnels. No operable equipment is associated with either 35 tunnel, as these tunnels have been sealed and may no longer receive dangerous waste. Backup or 36 redundant systems are not provided for either tunnel, as failure of the equipment would not have the 37 potential to result in a release of dangerous waste to the environment. There are no hazards associated 38 with tunnel equipment failure. 39 F.2.4.2 Mitigation of the Effects of Power Failure 40 Maintaining safe storage of materials in the PUREX Storage Tunnels is not contingent on continued 41 supply of electrical power. Electrical power is required to operate the water-fillable door and the 42 ventilation fan in both tunnels. Backup or redundant ventilation systems are not provided as the system is 43 operated only to maintain air balance and provide secondary control of mixed waste airborne particulate. 44 Power failure to either tunnel would not have the potential to result in the release of dangerous waste or 45 mixed waste to the environment. There are no hazards associated with the shutdown of the tunnel 46 ventilation systems due to loss of electrical power. Addendum F.6

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels I F.2.5 Personnel Protection Equipment 2 Personnel entering the PUREX Storage Tunnels are required to wear special protective clothing and 3 respiratory protection at all times because of the material stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels. 4 Protective clothing and full-face respirators with filters are considered to be sufficient protection from the 5 dangerous waste stored within the PUREX Storage Tunnels. Personnel are trained and qualified in using 6 the protective equipment and are checked routinely for mask fit. 7 F.3 Prevention of Reaction of Ignitable, Reactive, andlor Incompatible Waste 8 There is no reactive or incompatible waste stored in the PUREX Storage Tunnels. The only ignitable 9 waste stored within the tunnels is silver nitrate. The silver nitrate is present within the silver reactors 10 (deposited on unglazed ceramic packing) stored in Tunnel Number 2. 11 Although silver nitrate exhibits the characteristic of ignitability, it is contained within stainless steel 12 vessels, stored on railcars above the floor level, and isolated from combustible materials and other 13 dangerous waste. Additional measures to prevent reaction of the ignitable waste are not considered 14 necessary. 15 Addendum F.7

WA7890008967 PUREX Storage Tunnels 1 1. INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS 2 This Addendum discusses the inspection requirements for dangerous waste management units within the 3 Plutonium Uranium Extraction Facility (PUREX) Storage Tunnels. 4 1.1 PUREX Storage Tunnels 5 Because waste within the PUREX Storage Tunnels is inaccessible and exposure to the mixed waste would 6 be extremely hazardous to personnel, inspection of the tunnel interior will not be performed. External 7 inspections of the tunnels will be performed annually. The inspection schedule, log, and records will be 8 maintained in the Hanford Facility Operating Record, PUREX Storage Tunnels File for a minimum of 9 5 years. 10 Information from inspections will be recorded on inspection logs. The log forms are used to initiate 11 corrective action if necessary. The elements inspected at the PUREX Storage Tunnels are identified in 12 Table 1.1. Abnormal conditions are recorded, evaluated, and corrective action initiated as necessary. 13 Table 1.1. Inspection Schedule inspectionRequirement Description Freten Types of ProblemsFrequency Perform external surveillance of Annual External surfaces of the PUREX PUREX Storage Tunnels Storage Tunnels are observed for evidence of structural deterioration. Tunnel subsidence, erosion of the earth cover, and vent stack damage are of primary concern. The points of access to the PUREX Storage Tunnels are inspected to ensure warning signs are in place, visible, and legible. 14 Addendum.I.5
