Natural gas values for 2001 forward do not include blast furnace gas or other gas. 4 Beginning in 2002, data from the historic Form EIA-423 for independent power producers and combined heat and power producers a re included in this table. Prior to 2002, these data were not collected; the data for 2001 and previous years includ e only data collected from elect ric utilities via the historic F ERC Form 423. 5 The sulfur content for petroleum liquids in 2006 was 0.74 percent and for petroleum coke it was 5.15 percent. Because the tot al receipts of petroleum liquids in 2006 went down by approximately 60 percent while the receipts of petroleum coke re mained about the same, the weight of petroleum liquids was much less in 2006. As a result, the average sulfur content was more influenced by the petroleum coke recei pts and, therefore, increased significantly. R = Revised. Note: MCF equals 1,000 cubic feet. Totals may not equal sum of components because of independent rounding.
