The forms are easy to complete. Evaluation forms are effective tools for gauging immediate reactions to a class. Another great way to evaluate impact is to conduct an anonymous follow -up survey about a week after the class. Conside r using a free online tool to create a survey for the participants.

--- Page 12 ---
MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop , Participant Guide of 92 Ask questions such as: • Now that you have had time to reflect, what do you feel were the most compelling learning points of the Managing Cash Flow module? • What steps have you taken to apply the Managing Cash Flow module key principles to your own small business? • If you have not applied the principles of Managing Cash Flow to your small business, what prevented you? Evaluate what is next Here are some ways to identify which modules your participants will most want/need: • At the end of a class, conduct a debriefing conversation. Ask, “What should happen next?” • Scan the Parking Lot for questions that indicate a need for additional classes. • Interview guest experts for their ideas. They can o ffer great advice based on the questions the participants asked them. Getting Started With MSSB Selecting Modules When selecting which modules to deliver and in what sequence, please consider the following information: • The modules can stand -alone and be presented topic by topic • The modules can be mixed and matched to meet the entrepreneur’s needs • The modules can be integrated into an existing training program • The modules are free of copyrights, which means financial institution and community logos can be added to the materials • The modules are available in Word and PDF formats and thus customizable Selection Options Ideally any program will start with the two fundamental modules: Is Small Business Ownership a Good Fit for You? and Planning for a Heal thy Business . These modules cover fundamental principles of small business ownership. They are very interactive , which helps host organizations learn more about the entrepreneurs businesses and concerns. Some financial institutions and community organizati ons offer individual classes once or twice a week for a number of weeks, as shown on the following page . A benef it of this approach is that host organizations can plan and advertise an entire program ahead of time. It ’s easy to recruit and orient experts a s well. The downs ide to this approach is that host organizations are locked into a plan that may not fit the needs of their entrepreneurs.

As depicted below, the modules have been selected for Day 1 and the modules for Days 2, 3 and 4 are not set. This allows the host organization to custom design a program based on focus g roup feedback and from questions the entrepreneurs and small business owners ask. This option may be challenging to manage in terms of advertising and for recruiting any experts that might be need ed. The entrepreneurs in attendance will be invaluable advis ors on the selection and sequencing of modules. Ask them what they want to know and ideal times to offer classes. Be flexible. While it’s a great idea to have a sequence of modules in mind, be prepared to adapt plans based on each entrepreneur’s questions and feedback .

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop , Participant Guide of 92 Working with Experts Many MSSB Alliance members use guest experts to augment the experience and expertise of the host organization instructor. Guest experts bring a wealth of experience and expertise to Money Smart classes. There are three main categories of experts: Smal l business owners who have great stories to share (both success stories and cautionary tales) Representatives from such fields as banking, credit reporting and taxation Professionals who advise clients on a regular basis, such as accountants or insurance b rokers Guest experts contribute a great deal to Money Smart classes. They tell interesting stories and share real -life experiences about what to do, or not to do. There are some risks associated with working with experts, as well. If they are unprepared they can be ineffective. They can lose track of time or provide examples that are not relevant to the questions the learners ask. Some experts tend to use jargon or technical language which might confuse participants more than help them . When working with experts, provide them with clear directions and parameters to ensure success.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW PARTICIPANT GUIDE of 92 Introducing Bob and the Wired Cup Bob recently opened a new bakery café, The Wired Cup. The café has a great location in a small college town. To get started, Bob invested $30,000 of his own money and received a $20,000 loan from a commercial bank. He spent $45,000 on start- up costs, leaving $5,000 to run his business. The Wired Cup is already popular with students, university staff, and neighbors. Everyone loves the coffee and baked goods. A college dean has started to order croissants for the faculty dining hall. Bob is building a great new business. However, Bob has concerns. He has not yet paid himself, and he wonders when he can. The $5,000 is almost gone. Given that his key customers are students, he assumes many of them will go home o ver holiday breaks and the summer. Questions Bob is now asking: • How will he pay his bills if there are fewer customers? • Will he have enough money to ramp up again in September? • Should he buy in bulk to reduce costs? • Will suppliers allow Bob to buy on c redit, or does he still have to pay cash? The good news is that Bob is thinking ahead . He has time to work to find some solutions. As we review The Wired Cup’s cash flow issues, you will be able to apply these concepts to your own business. Notes The Wired Cup

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW PARTICIPANT GUIDE of 92 Cash Conversion Cycle A cash conversion cycle depicts how business dollars are invested in raw materials, resources, and other inputs. Those raw materials can be converted into products t hat are sold to generate payments or cash. If you have a short conversion cycle, you can quickly sell inventory or turn it back into cash which puts money back into the cash flow system in a relatively short period of time. If you have a long cash conve rsion cycle, you will not be able to use that money while your inventory is unsold, sitting on your shelves. Money will not be flowing back into the system. Notes

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW PARTICIPANT GUIDE of 92 Cash Flow Diagram Descriptions The cash flow diagram on the previous page contains several key cash flow elements. It is a representation of how cash moves in and out of the system, and many of the key decision points or valves a business owner can control. When you start a business, money flows into the business via debt or equity . The valves in the diagram represent decision points. Your decisions impact cash flow and increase or decrease your probability of success. Some valves are open all the time (like taxes and debt). They are a constant drain on your cash which is why they are on the bottom. Some valves are partially open, like the sales, general, and administrative valves. You always spend money here; how much is up to you. As you spend available cas h, balance in the center tank drops. Inventory . You spend money on raw materials, labor, and other direct costs to produce a product to sell (assuming you are producing a product, but the same principles apply for services as well). If you decide to spend a lot on inventory, you are deciding to tie up your money until you sell the inventory and turn it into cash. This is called the cash conversion cycle. Fixed assets are usually expensive items that last, such as buildings, upgrades to space, vehicles, equipment, computers, and technology. If you purchase an expensive fixed asset, it ties up available cash. A better option is to lease to keep cash flowing. Profit generator (sales pump ). In the top left corner is a sales pump. Keep this primed to pump sales back into the system. Accounts receivable (A/R). You may make a sale, but not the cash until you collect it. Ultimately you want to convert your accounts receivable into cash, so it flows into the center tank and becomes available cash Accounts payable (A/P ). In the center tank, accounts payable are represented by bricks. This is money owed to vendors and suppliers who extend credit to you. For example, you receive a product or service but you have not yet paid for it. You still have use of that money. The bricks elevate the water. Instead of having to pay for a product or service, you can use that money for marketing or paying another bill. Balancing accounts payable and accounts receivable is challenging. You want customers to pay you as quickly as po ssible (cash in) and you want to pay as slowly as possible (cash out). Your vendors are doing the same thing. They want you to pay quickly, and they may be slow to pay their own vendors. Ultimately, you want to have and be generating excess cash flow from profitable operations (ECFPO). This is the showerhead, which represents your paycheck.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW PARTICIPANT GUIDE of 92 Cash Flow Statements A cash flow statement tells a story: How much money you have to run your business. How much cash is moving in and out of the business. Wher e that cash is coming from and going to. When the cash is moving or needs to move. As a business owner, you need to think ahead in order to meet your financial obligations and run a profitable business. A cash flow statement helps identify when your bus iness is generating more cash than you need to meet obligations. Conversely, it tells you when the business is running short. Cash flow statements help you make smart, timely decisions that ensure your business is financially healthy over the long term. A cash flow statement for The Wired Cup is on the next page. Notes

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW PARTICIPANT GUIDE of 92 What Can Bob Do? To stay in business, Bob needs to increase his sales revenue. He also needs to negotiate agreements that decrease costs and help to control ca sh flow. To do this, he needs to juggle some competing demands. He wants to hold on to his cash as long as possible. His landlord and vendors want to be paid right away. To balance these expectations, Bob needs to make agreements that benefit all involved parties. These “win –win” negotiations benefit all parties. Bob has lots of opportunities to negotiate win– win agreements. If you were advising him, what would you suggest? • How can Bob increase sales revenue at The Wired Cup? • How could Bob negotiate a b etter deal or two with his vendors and suppliers? • How can Bob plan for the seasonal ups and downs in his business? • Is it wise for Bob to use a credit card to offset cash flow issues? Notes What NOT To Do • Do not postpone paying estimate d taxes. • Do not hide from loan officers – they can provide invaluable advice. • Do not pay vendors later (they can cut off supply). • Do not overestimate revenue. • Do not underestimate costs.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW PARTICIPANT GUIDE of 92 Negotiating Better Terms To manage cash flow, you want your customers to pay you right away so you can use that cash to meet your financial obligations. On the other hand, you want to pay your vendors as late as possible, usually 30 days. The trick is to manage your accounts receivable (the money others owe you) and yo ur accounts payable (the money you owe). Customers • If a customer pays cash, this is great. If a customer pays with a credit or debit card, this is good, but the profitability is lower because the business has to pay a credit card processing service and fee s charged by the credit card issuer. These fees are usually not negotiable. Ask customers to pay in cash to avoid fees. Some small companies no longer take credit or debit cards; the risk is that some customers might not buy if they do not have cash on the m. • Sell gift cards. The buyer of a gift card pays you the full amount of the gift card up front. • Corporate accounts are a great way to increase sales. The challenge is that these customers do not always pay right away. Most invoices are supposed to be pa id in 30 days. That creates lag time between when the product or service is provided, and when a business is paid. Most invoices are “net 30 days,” which means the client pays within 30 days of the date the product or service is delivered. To improve cash flow and to get paid early, a business owner can ask a corporate account to pay when the invoice is received, or maybe in 10 or 15 days. Offer them incentives to pay early. Most businesses offer a “2/10, net 30” discount meaning the customer will receive a 2% invoice discount if they pay in 10 days instead of 30. Vendors and Suppliers • Most new businesses are required by their vendors to pay cash for supplies, inventory, and the like. After you develop a good reputation for paying on time (maybe a year), ask vendors to invoice you instead of asking for cash. This allows a business to pay in 30 days, which preserves cash flow. Landlords A major fixed monthly expense for many business owners is a lease or rent payment. Before you agree to a lease and the subse quent fixed monthly cost, you may be able to negotiate better terms and payment options to free up your cash flow. Carefully review the lease conditions and negotiate any added expenses or fees associated with the lease, such as upkeep, maintenance, common areas, utilities, snow removal, landscaping services, or parking lot maintenance. As part of the negotiation you can discuss options, such as sub -leases, exclusivity, and co -tenancy. Think about what happens if you default. What would happen to your bus iness? You may be able to negotiate those terms as well. A lawyer could provide you advice. If you know that your business is seasonal, negotiate a payment plan. Let’s say your rent is $1,000 per month. If you anticipate your revenue to go down because of seasonal issues, ask the landlord to accept early or late payments. Another idea might be to make fewer payments. For instance, multiplying the $1,000 by 12 months equals $12,000. Divide $12,000 by nine, which comes to $1,333 per month. You pay the same $ 12,000 to the landlord but you do not have to pay during the three months when you expect your revenue to be down.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW PARTICIPANT GUIDE of 92 Toolkit of Resources – Managing Cash Flow Module Glossary of Cash Flow Terms Term Definition Accounts Payable Accounts payable (A/P) is money a business owner owes to vendors, service providers, tax agencies and so on. Liability that results from the purchase of goods or services (money owed to others). Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable (A/R) is money that is due from customers as a r esult of delivering goods or services and extending credit in the ordinary course of business. Accrual Basis of Accounting The accrual basis of accounting measures the performance and position of a company by recognizing economic events regardless of when cash transactions occur. The general idea is that economic events are recognized by matching revenues to expenses (the matching principle) at the time in which the transaction occurs rather than when payment is made (or received). This method allows the c urrent cash inflows/outflows to be combined with future expected cash inflows/outflows to give a more accurate picture of a company's current financial condition. Fixed Assets A fixed asset is a long -term tangible piece of property that a firm owns and uses in the production of its income and is not expected to be consumed or converted into cash any sooner than at least one year's time. Balance Sheet A balance sheet is a financial statement that summarizes a company's assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time. These three balance sheet segments give investors an idea as to what the company owns and owes, as well as the amount invested by the shareholders. Burn Rate A burn rate describes the rate at which a new company uses u p its venture capital to finance overhead before generating positive cash flow from operations. In other words, it's a measure of negative cash flow. Capital Capital can mean many things. Its specific definition depends on the context in which it is used. In general, it refers to financial resources available for use such as: financial assets or the financial value of assets, such as cash. It is also used to describe the factories, machinery, and equipment owned by a business and used in production. Cash Conversion Cycle A cash conversion cycle depicts how business dollars are invested in materials, resources, and other inputs. Raw materials can be converted into products that are sold to generate payments or cash. If a business has a short conversion cycl e, the owner can quickly turn it back into cash which puts money back into the business in a relatively short period of time. If a business has a long cash conversion cycle, the owner will not be able to use that money while inventory is unsold. Cash Flo w Statement A cash flow statement tells a business how much money is available to run the business, how much cash is moving in and out of the business, where that cash is coming from and going to, and when the cash is moving or needs to move.

--- Page 38 ---
MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW PARTICIPANT GUIDE of 92 Term Definition A cash flow statement helps a business owner to think ahead. It helps pinpoint when a business is generating more cash than needed to meet obligations. Conversely, it alerts a business owner when the business is running short. Cash flow statements are invaluable tool s that permit business owners to make smart, timely decisions over the long term. Cash on Hand Funds that are immediately available to a business, and can be spent as needed. Current Assets A balance sheet account that represents the value of all assets that are reasonably expected to be converted into cash within one year in the normal course of business. Current assets include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, marketable securities, prepaid expenses and other liquid assets that can be readily conver ted to cash. Current Liabilities A company's debts or obligations that are due within one year. Current liabilities appear on the company's balance sheet and include short term debt, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other debts Debt Principal Amount borrowed or the amount still owed on a loan, separate from interest Depreciation Income tax deduction that allows a taxpayer to recover the cost or other basis of certain property; annual allowance for the wear and tear, deterioration, or obsolescenc e of the property. Equity Equity is a stock or any other security representing an ownership interest. On a company's balance sheet, equity is the amount of the funds contributed by the owners (the stockholders) plus the retained earnings or losses. Fixed Cost A fixed cost does not change with an increase or decrease in the amount of goods or services produced. Fixed costs are expenses that have to be paid by a company, independent of any business activity. It is one of the two components of the total cos t of a good or service, along with variable cost. Gross Profit Gross Profit is a company's revenue minus its cost of goods sold. It is a company's residual profit after selling a product or service and deducting the cost associated with its production and sale. Income Statement A financial statement that measures a company's financial performance over a specific accounting period. Financial performance is assessed by giving a summary of how the business incurs its revenues and expenses through both operat ing and non- operating activities. It shows the net profit or loss incurred over a specific period, typically over a fiscal quarter or year. An Income Statement is also known as a profit and loss statement or statement of revenue and expense. Interest Interest is a fee paid for the use of another party's money. To the borrower it is the cost of renting money, to the lender the income from lending it. Invoice An invoice is a commercial document that itemizes a transaction between a buyer and a seller. It wi ll usually include the quantity of purchase, price of goods and/or services, date, parties involved, unique invoice number, and tax information. If goods or services were purchased on credit, the invoice

--- Page 39 ---
MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW PARTICIPANT GUIDE of 92 Term Definition will usually specify the terms of the deal and provi de information on the available methods of payment. An invoice is also known as a bill, statement, or sales invoice. Liquidity Liquidity is the degree to which an asset or security can be bought or sold in the market without affecting the asset's price. Liquidity is characterized by a high level of trading activity. Assets that can be easily bought or sold are known as liquid assets. The term is also used to define the ability to convert an asset to cash quickly. Also known as marketability. Liquidity is often calculated by using liquidity ratios. Net Profit Net Profit is your bottom line. This shows how much your company is making on sales after expenses, interest, and taxes. Variable Cost A variable cost is a corporate expense that varies with producti on output. Variable costs fluctuate depending on a company's production volume. They rise as production increases and fall as production decreases. Variable costs differ from fixed costs such as rent, advertising, insurance and office supplies, which tend to remain the same regardless of production output. Fixed costs plus variable costs equal total cost. Vendor A vendor is a party in the supply chain that makes goods and services available to companies or consumers. The term is typically used to describe an entity that is paid for the goods that are provided, rather than the manufacturer of the goods. A vendor, however, can operate both as the supplier of goods (seller) and the manufacturer.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE of 92 Getting Started These ideas will help you plan and present engaging and productive sessions: • Effective use of PowerPoint. Use the slides to introduce key concepts only. They are provided to enhance your presentation, they are not the presentation. Avoid reading slides to the learners. Add your perspective. Learners appreciate examples and brief anecdotes that make the concepts come alive. • Introductions. Introductions allow you to break the ice, create active instructor –participan t dialogue, and set the tone for the class. They also provide indicators of the experience levels of your learners. • Diversity of learner needs. Assume that some learners are just getting started while others are already business owners. Address the diverse needs of learner groups. • Agenda. The agenda helps participants understand how the training will be conducted. • Expectations. Discussing expectations gives participants the opportunity to tell you what they hope to learn from the training. • Objectives. Estab lishing objectives helps participants place the information to be learned in the proper context and ensures that the content is consistent with their expectations. • Participant Guide format and contents. The participant guide keeps participants on track wit h the presentation. Several worksheets help them apply key concepts to their own specific contexts. • Pre-and Post -Tests. The Pre -Test provides a baseline measurement for evaluating the impact of this class. The Post -Test gauges how well participants learned the content. Both the pre - and the post-test are on one form at the end of the Participant Guide . • Discussion points. Discussion points help participants reinforce learning. • Parking lot flipchart/ chart paper. This option is helpful if participants ask que stions that you do not have time to answer. Instead of answering right away, agree to answer at a later time. “Park” the questions on a flipchart or chart paper, and make arrangements to follow up with the participant(s) after the class. • Breaks . No formal breaks are recommended. Encourage participants to take rest room breaks if they need them.

Instead, whenever possible, briefly paraphrase the objectives.  Point out that you will use the Bob’s Wired Cup case to introduce concepts.  Emphasize that what is most important is how these concepts apply to the unique situations of the learners. 10 minutes Slide 6 Introducing Bob and The Wired Cup We will use a realistic example to review a new business owner’s cash flow management decisions. As we review Bob’ s cash flow issues, you may find that these concepts relate to your own cash flow questions. Facilitation Note:  The case is theoretical. If participants ask questions about the numbers on Bob’s statements, remind them the case is intended to introduce fundamental cash flow concepts .  Ask one of the participants to read Bob’s story out loud from page 4 in the Participant Guide. From Participant Guide : Introducing Bob and The Wired Cup Bob recently opened a new bakery café, The Wired Cup. The café has a great location in a small college town. To get started, Bob invested $30,000 of his own money and received a $20,000 loan from a commercial bank. He spent $45,000 on start- up costs, leaving $5,000 to run the business. The Wired Cup is already popular wit h students, university staff,

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE of 92 Instructor Notes Presentation Guidelines and neighbors. Everyone loves the coffee and baked goods. A college dean has started to order croissants for the faculty dining hall. Bob is building a great new business. However, Bob has concerns. He has not yet paid himsel f, and he wonders when he can. The $5,000 is almost gone. Given that his key customers are students, he assumes many will go home over holiday breaks and the summer. Questions Bob is now asking: • How will he pay his bills if there are fewer customers? • Will he have enough money to ramp up again in September? • Should he buy in bulk to reduce costs? • Will suppliers allow Bob to buy on credit, or does he still have to pay cash? The good news is that Bob is thinking ahead . He has time to find some solutions. As we review the Wired Cup’s cash flow issues, you will be able to apply these concepts to your own business. Facilitation Note:  Thank the volunteer for the assistance. Slide 7 Introductions: Where are YOU on the Cash Flow Management Continuum? Befo re we go on and learn more about Bob’s cash flow experiences it will be helpful to learn your backgrounds and experiences so far with cash flow management. Facilitation Note:  Ask the participants to briefly introduce themselves and their experiences so far with cash flow management – from beginner to expert.  Validate each person’s experience level as valid.  Encourage the experts in the class to offer ideas and examples from their experience to the rest of the group.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE of 92 Instructor Notes Presentation Guidelines Opening Balance Sheet for The Wired Cup, Cont. This opening balance sheet tells a story: how much money Bob had to start his business, how he financed it, what he did with that money, and how much was left over to run the business. The balance sheet tells us that Bob invested $30,000 of his own money or owner’s equity, and he borrowed $20,000. The $20,000 loan is over five years, with an 14.54% interest rate. In year one, Bob will pay back $3,371 of principal and will pay the remaining balance of $16,629 in years two through five. If you do not have the necessary capital to start your business, y ou have two options to get the capital that you need: • Equity. Friends, family and/or business partners invest in your business. They provide you with cash; you give them equity or a piece of the business. • Debt. You borrow the money from family, friends, or a lending institution, such as a bank. You do not give up equity or ownership but you do have to pay back the loan. You will pay back both principal and interest. There are many types of lending or borrowing options. Slide 9 A Few Notes About Debt It takes some effort to obtain a small business loan. As part of the process you will need to provide a business plan. The Money Smart for Small Business module, Planning for a Healthy Business provides a lot of information about various ways to plan a succe ssful business. Know your credit score. The higher your score the lower the risk for creditors. For more information, attend the Money Smart module on Credit Reporting . Banks have differing criteria for lending. Talk with your local bankers before you ne ed a loan. The stronger your relationship, the more supportive they will be to help you secure a loan if you meet their lending criteria. The Money Smart module on Banking Services can help. Be prepared to personally sign for the loan. If a business is una ble to meet its financial obligations, you will be held responsible. Also be prepared to pledge collateral. One last note: manage your credit cards to avoid high fees and interest. B usiness credit cards may be one of the mo st expensive forms of business c redit.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE of 92 Instructor Notes Presentation Guidelines Slide 10 (This slide is intentionally repeated – it is the same as slide 8.) Back to the Opening Balance Sheet In total, Bob had $50,000 to spend to open The Wired Cup. He spent $45,000 on equipment, materials, and other assets as indicated on the balance sheet ($29,500 fixed assets and $15,500 for current assets = $45,000). He had $5,000 cash remaining to run his business ($50,000 -$45,000 = $5,000). If I were Bob’s lender, a potential business partner, or a vendo r, I would look at this opening balance sheet and ask the following: • Has he invested enough of his own money in this venture? • Did he finance the business wisely? For instance, does he carry too much debt? The terms and time requirements for loan repayment can make a huge impact on cash flow. • Did he wisely spend the $50,000 ? • Is there enough available cash left over to run the business? Is $5,000 enough to carry him through a six month period? We do not have time to discuss these questions and the answers i n detail. I am just explaining that an opening balance sheet tells a story which can prompt constructive dialogues with stakeholders. A balance sheet tells a story, but it is just the first chapter. The story continues on into the cash flow statement. Clarify and Transition Are there any more questions about opening balance sheets before we move on ?

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE of 92 Instructor Notes Presentation Guidelines 40 minutes Slide 11 Three Views of Cash Flow Let’s look at three views of cash flow: a cash conversion cycle , a cash flow diagram , and The Wired Cu p’s cash flow statement . Combined together, these three views provide a comprehensive overview of a cash flow system. Slide 12 Slide 13 The Cash Conversion Cycle A cash conversion cycle consists of three components: A business pays for raw materials. The business makes a product or service using those materials. The business sells products or services. The trick is to know how long it will take to complete the cycle. That rate of conversion impacts cas h flow. If you have a short cycle , you sell inventory or turn it back into cash quickly, which puts money back into the cash flow system. If you have a long cash conversion cycle you will not be able to use that money while inventory is sitting on your sh elves. The Cash Flow Diagram Another way to describe cash flow is with a diagram, like the one on page 7 in your Participant Guide . provides descriptions of the elements that make up this diagram. We will review this diagram to get a big picture o f cash flow and how all the elements – the pipes and valves – work together.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE of 92 Instructor Notes Presentation Guidelines Cash Flow Diagram Descriptions This diagram is a representation of how cash flows in and out of the system. It depicts man y decision points or valves you control. When you start a business, money flows into the business via debt or equity. I n the case of The Wired Cup, Bob had $30,000 of his own money invested in the business, the equity bucket in this diagram. In addition, B ob borrowed $20,000, the debt bucket. The combined $50,000 is the available cash working capital. The valves in this cash flow diagram represent decision points. Your decisions impact cash flow and increase or decrease your probability of success. Some va lves are open all the time such as sales taxes and debt. You have to pay them. They are a constant drain on your cash, which is why they are on the bottom. Some valves are partially open, like the sales, general, and administrative valves. What you spend is up to you. As you spend available cash, the balance in the center tank drops. Inventory . You spend money on raw materials, labor, and other direct costs to produce a product to sell -- assuming you are producing a product; the same principles apply for services as well. If you spend a lot on inventory you tie up your money until you sell the inventory, and turn it into cash. Fixed assets are usually expensive: buildings, upgrades to space, vehicles, equipment, computers, and technology. If you purchase an expensive fixed asset , it ties up cash. A better option may be to lease to k eep cash flowing. Profit generator (sales pump ). In the top left corner, we have a sales pump. Keep this primed to pump sales back into the system. Accounts receivable (A/R). You may make a sale, but not receive the cash until you collect it. Ultimately you want to convert A/R into cash, so it flows into the center tank and becomes available. Some A/R will not be paid; this is called bad debt. Usually after 90 days, an A/R will not be paid. When you extend credit and create an A/R, you need to follow up t o ensure you receive the payment. Accounts payable (A/P ). In the center tank, accounts payable are represented by bricks. This is money owed to vendors and suppliers who extend credit to you. For example, you receive a product or service but you have not yet paid for it. You still have use of that money. The bricks elevate the water. Instead of having to pay for a product or service, you can use that money for marketing or paying

Descr iptive details begin on page 19 of this guide. another bill. It is challenging to balance accounts payable and accounts rece ivable. You want customers to pay you as quickly as possible (cash in) and you want to pay your vendors as slowly as possible (cash out). Ultimately, you want to have and be generating excess cash flow from profitable operations or ECFPO. The showerhead r epresents your paycheck. The broken pipe represents how depreciation can be used to reduce your taxable income. We won’t get into this in this class for time management issues. This is a good question to share with an accountant. This diagram represents a cash flow system and decision points you control. Of course, in business we would not use a diagram. We use a statement which tells a story with numbers. The Cash Flow Statement Please turn to page 10 in your Participant Guide to see a cash flow statem ent for The Wired Cup.

--- Page 65 ---
MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE of 92 Instructor Notes Presentation Guidelines The Cash Flow Statement, cont. The cash flow statement is a valuable decision making tool for business owners, investors, and creditors . It allows everyone to make smart, informed decisions about your business. In this example, Bob made projections based on two months of actual experience in August and September. He does not know how much seasonality --su mmer vacations at the college -- will affect business. He assumes the impact will be significant. The first column lists money in categories such as loan receipts, owner’s capital, and so on, and money out such as operating expenses for accounting, accounts payable/debt, advertising, and so on. The second column represents Bob’s opening balance sheet start -up costs. You would not typically see this on a cash flow statement. We include this information to demonstrate how elements of an opening balance sheet t ransfer over to the cash flow statement. The rest of the columns represent monthly income and expenses. As mentioned before, Bob has had two months of actual expenses. Based on what he knows so far, he projected income and expenses for the rest of the yea r. Notice that Bob had $5,000 in available cash. His sales were $25,000, and sales tax was $1,563. • A note about sales tax. Put this in a separate bank account. Do not co -mingle tax money in your regular bank account. You are collecting tax on behalf of the government. This is not your money to use. Most likely, you will be required to pay this quarterly or even monthly to the gover nment. The payroll taxes rate used in this example is 15%. You will need to determine the appropriate local, state, and applica ble federal taxes. In August, The Wired Cup had a total inflow of cash: $26,563 ($25,000 of sales revenue plus $1,563 of sales tax). That means that at the end of August, Bob’s total available cash was $31,563 ($5,000 + $26,563 = $31,563). If we look at the bottom of the spreadsheet for August we see that $29,253 was the cash out flow for the month. • Some cash outflows are fixed month to month, such as Bob’s lease payment of $1,350 and the cable/Internet payment of $200. • Some cash outflows are variable, s uch as advertising and

--- Page 66 ---
MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE of 92 Instructor Notes Presentation Guidelines utilities. Variable amounts fluctuate from month to month. You have some control over how cash flows in and out of your business. For example, for sales you decide what you will sell, where, to whom, how, and at what price. The same goes for expenses. You can decide what space to lease, how much debt to carry, when to advertise, when and how much raw materials to purchase, and how many staff to employ. In August, Bob has available cash of $31,563 and cash outflows of $29,253. $31,563 - $29,253 = $2,309 in his bank account at the end of August. This $2,309 becomes the beginning balance for the month of September, and the process starts all over again. • In September: $2,309 + $27,000 + 1,688 = $30,997 available cash for September. Month ly expenses are $29,778. $30,997 - $29,778 = $1,218 cash available at the end of September, which becomes the beginning balance for October. To sum up: Bob is happy. The Wired Cup is doing well, but he is worried about the rest of the year. He projects he will be able to pay all of his financial obligations but he will be cutting it close. Some business owners overestimate revenue and underestimate costs. This means they will at some point have a cash flow crunch and will not have cash available to meet their obligations. To prevent this, consider developing a couple of cash flow statements: • Best case scenario: This would be an ideal situation where all your dreams come true. • Worst case scenario: This would be a much more conservative scenario where you do not get the sales revenue you would hope for and costs are higher. • Most likely: This would be like the Goldilocks story —not too hot, not too cold, but just right. It is the most likely scenario, somewhere between a best and worst case. In this example, B ob created a most likely projection. Given that he knows the students and faculty leave for vacation, in July he projects a negative $4,316. You can’t have a negative cash situation! Negative cash means game over. What you want to achieve is excess cash flow from profitable operations. This is when you can shower yourself with some cash.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE of 92 Instructor Notes Presentation Guidelines Slide 15 Slide 16 What Can Bob Do? Please turn to page 11 of the Participant Guide . Bob needs to turn some valves wide open and turn down others in order to hold on to his cash as long as possible. If you were Bob’s advisors, what would you advise him to do? • How can Bob increase sales revenue at The Wired Cup? • How could Bob negotiate a better deal or two with his vendors and suppliers? • How can Bob plan for the seasonal ups and downs in his business? • Is it wise for Bob to use a credit card to offset cash flow issues? Facilitation Note:  These questions motivate the participants to think through common cash flow management scenarios.  Thank participants for their ideas and suggestions.  After the participants have a chance to offer suggestions, reveal the next slide which provides some answers. Possible Ideas for Bob Note that some of the ideas you suggested are on this slide. Nice job advising Bob! • Bob can incr ease the flow of revenue into his business. • Bob can reduce outflow, perhaps by making arrangements with vendors or his landlord. If Bob pays his entire rent in 10 months he will pay more during the 10 busy months and no rent in July and August which promi se to be slow. • Bob might cut back when he expects business to slow down. Perhaps his staff can work fewer hours or he can cut back on menu items. The point is that by managing cash flow, Bob is able to control his business over the long term. He can be s trategic and plan ahead.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE of 92 Instructor Notes Presentation Guidelines 15 minutes Summary, Post -Test, and Evaluation Slide 17 Slide 18 What NOT to Do Never use your sales tax as a financing option. Some business owners use sales tax in a cash crunch hoping they replace the tax w hen things look up. This is a risky bet. Penalties are high for not paying taxes on time. If you anticipate that you might miss or be late on a loan payment, talk to your loan officer as soon as you know. Loan officers understand cash flow and typical bus iness challenges. It is in their interest to help. They don’t want to see you fail. They make money when you are successful and pay back the principal and loan interest. • Do not pay vendors late; they can cut off supply. • Do not overestimate revenue. This is a common mistake many new business owners tend to make. • Do not underestimate costs. Again, this is a common mistake in start -up businesses. Do your homework to find out the real costs of doing business. It Is Professional to Ask for Help It is not a sign of weakness if financial management is new for you. Find a great accountant or technical advisor at SBDC or SCORE who can explain cash flow in ways that relate the concepts to your own business. An accountant will encourage you to use a computer to mana ge your cash flow documentation. If you do not already use financial management software, take a course to develop this skill. You also need to manage your paperwork in a professional manner. Set up a reliable filing system to keep track of all financial documents such as tax forms, receipts, invoices, and so on. “Co-opetition”is a real term. Competitors can be good advisors as they cope with the same cash flow issues you do. Find ways to cooperate and share information with them. They have experience to sh are. Check out the Toolkit of Resources in your Participant Guide for ideas about where to locate technical assistance.

--- Page 69 ---
MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE of 92 Instructor Notes Presentation Guidelines Slide 19 Slide 20 Key Points to Remember • Managing cash flow is a core competency of small business ownership. • A balance sheet tells a compelling story. A cash flow statement continues that story. Use it to monitor projected and actual income and expenses. • Plan for seasonal fluctuations. Every business has ups and downs. Ask some of your competitors when t heir usual slow times tend to occur. • Try to maintain a rapid cash conversion cycle. Try not to tie up too much cash in inventory. Lease equipment instead of buying it. If you do buy equipment, buy used whenever you can. • Manage your paperwork like a pro. Your accountant will expect to see spreadsheets, an accounting program, well - organized receipts, invoices, and financial statements such as banking and credit card statements. • Ask an accountant for advice. Ideally this class has helped you prepare for a seri es of helpful conversations. Toolkit of Resources The Toolkit in the back of your Participant Guide provides helpful information such as: • A glossary of common cash flow terms. • A sample cash flow template (get the complete template online). • Tips for negotiating better terms with customers, vendors and suppliers, and landlords. • A list of great resources where you can get more information. Many of these are free or very inexpensive. Facilitation Note  If you added Local Resources to the list in the Particip ant Guide , point out some of these.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide of 92 Success Tips The MSSB Train -the-Train er instructors/facilitators should have relevant instructor/facilitator skills and experience. The FDIC may conduct orientation workshops to familiarize potential instructors with the curriculum, but neither the FDIC nor SBA certifies trainers to deliver the MSSB curriculum. As an instructor, you are responsible for: • Identifying the learning and communication needs of participants • Focusing and directing participants • Aiming discussions toward course objectives • Making sure every participant has the opportunity to contribute to the discussion You can accomplish these objectives by liste ning, asking questions, observing participants’ reactions and leading by example. A first step to delivering an effective presentation is to know your audience. You must understand the goals of the course and why the participants need this information. Ti ps for delivering effective presentations include: • Know your material well. Thoroughly review ALL of the training materials. • Identify potential trouble spots in the exercises, as well as hints for assisting participants. • Practice your presentation. • Use language familiar to the participants, avoiding jargon or unfamiliar terms. • Select and prepare anecdotes from real -world experiences that can be used to illustrate special scenarios, generate discussion and maintain participant interest. • Speak clearly. • Be aw are of the tone and pace of how you are speaking. • Avoid going off on tangents and getting off track during a presentation. • Minimize the use of filler words (such as “uh” and “um”). • Make eye contact with participants. • Use natural and positive body language and facial expressions. • Avoid fidgeting, pacing and other nervous habits. • Be yourself. • Make sufficient copies of the Participant Guide and handouts. • If using an LCD projector, make sure beforehand that all computer equipment is functioning and prepare a backup hardcopy of the PowerPoint slides for use during the training. • Give yourself ample time to set up the classroom and distribute participant materials before the training is scheduled to take place. A successful instructor must be able to introduce act ivities, assign participants to small groups, give instructions and process activity results. When introducing activities, explain the objectives, and emphasize the benefits and potential outcomes of the learning activity. Connect, or link, activities to previously learned concepts and discussions .

--- Page 80 ---
MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide of 92 Materials and Equipment Needed • Train -the-Trainer Instructor Guide. • Train -the-Trainer Participant Guide. Print one for each participant and one for the trainer to be used as a reference. The Train -the-Trainer p articipant guide should be printed on two two -sides. • Train -the-Trainer PowerPoint. This should be customized ahead of time, especially if the training includes various sponsoring organizations and/ or speakers . • Laptop or computer loaded with the PowerPoint presentation. It is n’t necessary to share the slides with participants. All of the information that’s needed is in their Participant Guides . As a best practice, be prepared for technical issues. Print a few sets of the slides ahead of time and bring a thumb drive with your presentation just in case. • Chart paper and markers for recording responses to key questions and/or to create a Parking Lot for questions you might not be able to answer in class. C hart paper can be created ahead of time. • Slide projector , screen or monitor/TV to display the PowerPoint presentation. • (Optional) Stopwatch or other timer. • (Optional) Painter’s tape for posting chart pages on the wall. • (Optional) Post -it Notes and highlighters that participants can use to flag or highlight key information in their Train -the-Trainer Participant Guides. The Instructor Guide is your roadmap for presenting the Train- the-Trainer workshop. It includes: • The purpose and objectives of the Train- the-Trainer workshop and the curriculum • A detailed lesson plan • Thumbnails of the overhead slides • Additional information that ’s not part of the Train- the-Trainer Participant Guide. The lesson plan is laid out in a two- column format. The left -hand column contains the slides used in the presentation. The right -hand column contains a word- for-word script of the module content, as well as more lengthy instructions for delivering the content and conducting the practice exercises. Each module includes a set of visuals to help you present the module content. They are presented in both PowerPoint and PDF formats so you can use them with your specific projection equipment. You should give each student a Participant Guide to use during the training and as a reference when the training is over. It contains: • Important c oncepts and facts presented in the Train- the-Trainer workshop. • The evaluation form • Space for taking notes • (Optional) Additional ready -to-use resources such as the MSSB Flyer, Agenda, Invitation and Worksheet Templates to be used during Train- the-Trainer wo rkshops

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide of 92 Giving Instructions The Instructor Guide provides instructions for all the activities in the modules. However, participants may still need clarification. It ’s important to speak clearly and slowly when presenting the objectives of an activity and giving instructions. Make sure to define important terms and concepts (refer to the MSSB TtT glossary) and, when possible, demonstrate activities or provide examples for the participants. Also, periodically ask if there are any questions. While students are completing an activity, you should circulate to answer questions and encourage discussion. Keep track of the amount of time allotted for each activity, and inform the students when time is winding down. When processing results, ask questions about how the participants reached their conclusions. Keep the processing from becoming redundant or repetitive by asking the next group to report findings that are different from the previous group ’s or by asking each group to present just a part of the solution. When processing individual comments, make sure a diverse group of students is called on to provide responses. Encourage students with different experience levels and perspectives to contribute their observations. Acknowledge correct responses and provide alternative approaches if incomplete or inaccurate responses are given. Facilitating Discussions Interaction among students contributes to a successful learning experience. Varying the composition of small groups for exercises and activities not only energizes students, but also creates more opportunity to exchange information and encounter different perspectives. There are a number of techniques for assigning students to small groups. Common methods include telling students to partner with someone they don’t know or counting off by a specific number and having all the “ones” work together, all the “twos” work together, and so on. Other ways include arbitrarily grouping people who are close to each other or asking students to turn their chairs around to form groups with people at the next table. Informative discussions and exchange of information among instructors and students are other keys to the success of this course. As an instructor, your role is to elicit comments from the students while maintaini ng the focus of the discussion. The following tips may be useful when you are leading group discussions: • Paraphrase what someone has said so the participant will know he or she has been understood and to ensure the rest of the class hears the comment. • Com pliment students on interesting or insightful comments. • Use open -ended questions, because they trigger better discussions than close -ended ones. • Mediate differences of opinions. • Pull ideas together, showing their relationship to one another. • Summarize, and record on chart paper, if appropriate, the major views of the group.

--- Page 82 ---
MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide of 92 Classroom Set -Up The most effective classroom set -up is to arrange the room into table groups that seat four to six students each. This allows students to complete the small group exe rcises comfortably. If this arrangement is not possible, you may have to move desks and chairs into small groups to conduct these activities. Using Chart Paper Chart paper lets you capture meaningful information generated by discussion and display it for all students to see. When using chart paper: • Prepare chart paper in advance. • Prepare titles beforehand if students will provide responses. • Write with large, clear, bold letters, using 20 words per page as your guide. • Use words or short phrases to indica te key ideas. • Check your spelling. • Write, turn to the audience and then talk; don’t talk while writing. • Don’t obstruct students’ view of the chart. • Leave the bottom quarter of the paper blank so all of the content can be seen by those in the back of the ro om. • Tear off chart paper you want the group to be able to refer to throughout the course, and post it on the walls around the classroom. Using Handouts Like other types of materials, handouts help vary the pace of training sessions by giving students a different focus. Reinforce the connection between handouts and course content by introducing and reviewing them. When using handouts: • Prepare the appropriate number of copies ahead of time. • Make sure your handout is concise and designed for easy reading. • Use colored paper to make locating the handouts easier if they ’ll be referred to frequently during the course. • Make sure you distribute handouts to each student before beginning to discuss their content. • Don’t distribute handout s as you are speaking; students will focus on the materials rather than what you are saying. Using Visual Aids These tips for using visual aids will help you to be an effective presenter: • Keep visual aids out of sight until you are ready to use them. • Stand to the side of your visua l aid.

--- Page 83 ---
MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide of 92 • Talk to and face the audience, not the visual aid. • Don’t block your face with the visual aid. • Maintain eye contact with your audience. • Make sure your audience has the time to fully read and understand the visual aid before removing it and moving to the next one . • Know where the visual aid goes when you’re finished using it. • Switch the projector off when not in use; its noise and light can be distracting. It’s helpful to practice using visual aids before delivering the actual presentation. All visual aids should be free of grammatical errors and clutter. When presenting visual aids, describe the content and add a few anecdotes or meaningful details. Visual aids should not be read verbatim. Consider the Three Learning Styles While Teaching Experts know that most people learn best in one of three ways: • Visual : Those who learn best by seeing how things are done. • Use visual aids, such as handouts, slides, written instructions, charts and demonstrations. • Stand to the side, talk to and face the audience , allow the audience time to fully read and understand. • Prepare charts in advance, using large, clear, bold letters. Write, turn to the audience, and then talk. • Design handouts for easy reading, and use colored paper to make locating handouts easier. • Auditory : Those who learn best by listening or hearing instructions. • They are affective learners, that is, they tend to be more intuitive than rational. Therefore, they have to feel the learning experience. • They like to get involved with others and share i deas and information. • They like thinking out loud about what they are learning. • Use exercises that allow them to share their experiences with each other. Lectures and audio tapes are also useful for auditory learners. • Tactile/Kinesthetic : Those who lear n best by doing. • They like to experiment. • They dislike conventional educational approaches. • They get bored with lectures, presentations or anything that doesn’t allow them to be physically active. • They learn best from hands -on training and physically ac tive exercises. Things to Avoid During a Presentation You can lose the interest of students by doing any of the following: • Failing to prepare • Reading verbatim from notes or a scrip t • Teaching without student involvement

--- Page 84 ---
MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide of 92 • Diverging from course objectives • Avoiding eye contact • Using confusing visual aids • Behaving in a condescending or superior manner • Using jargon or language that ’s either too simple or complex for participant s • Lacking empathy for participant s’ needs • Using offensive or critical humor • Making pr omises you can’t deliver Questions for Self -Reflection Here are some potential challenges you may face. How would you deal with them? • You have made promises you cannot deliver • You are asked a question and you do not know the answer • Fewer or more people show up than anticipated • Someone is sleeping • Someone brought a baby who constantly cries • No one responds to your questions • One person monopolizes the discussion

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide of 92 Accommodating Students with Disabilities Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 On July 26, 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) became law. The law is designed to protect the civil rights of people with disabilities. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by guaranteeing equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities in public accommodations, commercial facilities, employment, transportation, state and local government services, and telecommunications. The ADA is built on the principles of equal opportunity, full participation, independent living and economic self - sufficiency. It reflects the disability community ’s determination to participate fully in the life of their community like other citizens and to have choice and control over their own futures. It ’s the most comprehensive policy statement ever made in law in the United States about how the nation should address individuals with disabilities . As a civil rights law, the ADA is similar to other civil rights acts that protect individuals from being discriminated against based on arbitrary criteria such as race, color, religion, age, national origin and sex. For other groups with civil rights protection, the problem has generally been discrimination through policies that limit their participation. For people with disabilities, discrimination often also takes the form of inaccessible facilities that make it impossible for them to gain access to or participate in “standard” activities. For example, stairs leading to the only entrance into a building prohibit entry by someone who uses a wheelchair. Sim ilarly, texts and handouts provided only on paper and in standard- size typeface are inaccessible to someone who is blind or has low vision. In these cases, the ADA requires changes to buildings or locations, and modifications to the way products or services are provided. Making the modules useful and understandable for everyone, regardless of whether or not they have a disability, is perhaps the best reason of all for making the courses accessible. Low- and moderate -income individuals, especially those with little or no banking experience, often don’t have the tools necessary to save and manage money. This lack of a basic understanding of how money works in our society may keep them from achieving financial independence. These individuals also include a significant number of persons with lifelong disabilities, as well as older individuals who acquire disabilities as they age. Some may have undiagnosed or hidden learning disabilities. Requests for Accommodations You may want to consider using a registratio n form with a space where individuals can indicate whether they need any accommodations and, if so, what types of accommodations may be required. You may also want to ask if students require materials in alternate formats. People with disabilities are nev er required to self -identify as having a disability – even if the disability is obvious. Therefore, the registration form should not ask the individual to specifically identify the type of disability. That information is not necessary for you to know, and asking for it could be viewed as a type of discrimination.

--- Page 86 ---
MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide of 92 However, providing a space on the registration form to request accommodations is neutral and welcoming. It’s also a good idea for you to ask all of the students for a way to contact them, by phone and by email, so that you can communicate with people individually if you have questions about any part of the registration form. Put the request for contact information in the body of the registration form – not in the place where you ask if accommodati ons are needed. How to Make Classes Accessible to Students with Disabilities There are many things that both you and the sponsoring agency can do to make the modules accessible to people with a wide range of disabilities. An overview of actions that can be taken to ensure accessibility follows. Nondiscrimination Qualified individuals with disabilities cannot be denied participation simply because of their disability. You can limit participation in your course to individuals who meet some general criteria – such as being over the age of 62 or unemployed – but if an individual qualifies on those grounds, she or he may not be denied participation because of a disability. Physical Access When deciding where to hold the class, look for a location that is acc essible for people who use wheelchairs or scooters or who have other difficulties walking or climbing stairs. People with mobility limitations need to be able to get into the building without using steps or crossing over a high object. If the main entrance is not accessible, a sign should be posted there indicating the location of the closest accessible entrance. Classes should be held on the upper floors of a building only if they can be reached by an elevator. The building should also have at least one “u nisex” accessible restroom. Other physical access issues to consider in determining the location of the classrooms are clearly marked accessible parking spaces located close to the accessible entrance, Braille signage on the elevator call buttons and on the buttons inside the elevators , and raised letters and Braille signage identifying the restrooms. The elevators should also have chimes or a recorded voice indicating the different floors. In the classroom itself, check to be sure that there is at least 3 2 inches of clear space in the aisles and along the edges of the seating area. This is how much space someone using a wheelchair needs to move freely around the room. If you are using individual desks and chairs and someone who uses a wheelchair enters the room, ask that person if you should move one of the desks or if she or he prefers to transfer from the wheelchair to the desk chair. Always ask; never assume. People with a disability know what works best for them. Similarly, if the room is arranged like a classroom with long tables and individual chairs, it’s always a good idea to remove one or two of the chairs from the ends of rows in different areas of the room before the class starts, so that individuals using wheelchairs or scooters can have a choice of seating arrangements – the same way that others in the class have a choice about where they want to sit. Effective Communication Some individuals have disabilities that affect their ability to communicate – for example, people who are blind or have l ow vision or people who are deaf or hearing impaired. Other disabilities that affect communication include cognitive or learning disabilities that may impact the ability to read. People who have cognitive disabilities or learning disabilities may have diff iculty reading written material.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide of 92 Under the ADA, both private and public entities are required to communicate effectively with individuals with disabilities. The obligation to communicate effectively applies to the presentation and exchange of information in all forms, including sound, print, graphics and speech. The law says that people with communication disabilities are entitled to appropriate “aids and services where necessary to ensure effective communications.” With respect to the Money Smart cours es, these aids and services could include: • Assisting someone with cognitive or learning disabilities by reading aloud the pre - and post -course tests; or • Helping someone with a disability write their answers to the tests or complete other Money Smart forms ; or • Making sure not to turn your back on someone who is lip reading; or • Wearing a lapel microphone or using a handheld microphone to amplify what is being said for persons who use hearing aids or auxiliary listening devices; or • Making sure that any videos used in class are captioned for pe ople who are deaf or hard of hearing and that written material presented on screen is read aloud, either by the narrator on the video or by the course instructor. Sometimes communication assistance can include providing a sign language interpreter, upon request, if doing so does not result in an undue burden. Undue burden is defined in the ADA as “significant difficulty or expense.” However, even if providing a sign language interpreter or some other type of communication assistance is an undue burden, you still are expected, if at all feasible, to provide some other type of assistance, such as a copy of the Instructor Guide, so that a person who is deaf or hard of hearing can follow along as the class is taught. Some peo ple with visual disabilities have difficulty reading standard -size text or viewing materials projected on the overhead screen. Copies of the slides for each module can be printed out and given to these individuals to use as you present the course content. Similarly, handouts used during the course can sometimes be difficult to handle for people who have difficulty using their hands and fingers. Other people may have difficulty hearing what you are saying. If individuals can read lips, allow them to sit in the front where they can have an unobstructed view of your face. If you are using an overhead projector, make sure that you continue to face the students as you cover the major points. Keep your Instructor Manual open to the individual slides, or, better s till, print out a copy of the overhead materials so that you can read the text on the slides without turning your head away from the person who has the hearing impairment. When there is class discussion or when someone asks a question, repeat what has been said so that the person lip reading can be part of the discussion. Some individuals with significant speech disabilities use an augmentative communication device that uses a computer to produce synthesized speech. When they want to ask a question or cont ribute to the class discussion, they use a keyboard to key in what they want to say. Since keying in the content can take a few moments, you can acknowledge their intention to speak, saying something like, “Yes, Mr. Jones, we’ll get to you as soon as you a re ready,” and then making certain that you do go back to him as soon as the keying in is completed. (Most keyboards make a small beep as each word or phrase is keyed in.) However, during an interaction between the person with the disability and another individual, etiquette demands that you wait respectfully until the comments are keyed in and played.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide of 92 Guidelines for Talking About Disabilities Here are some guidelines that will help you communicate with your students who have disabilities in ways that won’t offend them: • Do not refer to a person's disability unless it is relevant. • Use “disability” rather than “handicap” to refer to a person’s disability , if indeed you need to refer to it . It’s okay to say that a person is handicapped by obstacles, such as architectural barriers or the attitudes of ignorant or insensitive people. Never use “ cripple/crippled ” in any reference to disability. • When referring to a person’s disability, use “people first” language . In other words, when necessary, say “person with a disability ” rather than “ a disabled person” . Since “disabled ” is an adjective, it ’s important to avoid ridiculous and improper constructions such as “ disabled group” or “disabled transportation.’ Instead, build phrases using the word “ disability. ” For ex ample, “ disability activist, ” or “disability community,” are correct and not contradictions to the “ people first ” ideas. • Never refer to people with disabilities as “the disabled, the blind, the epileptics, a quadriplegic,” etc. Descriptive terms should be used as adjectives, not as nouns. • Never use the word “retarded” or the phrase “mental retardation”. You can use “intellectual disability” or “cognitive impairment”. • Avoid negative or sensational descriptions of a person’s disability. Don’t say “suffers fro m,” “a victim of,” or “afflicted with. ” Don’t refer to people with disabilities as “ patients ” unless they are receiving treatment in a medical facility. Never say “invalid.” Treat people with disabilities with r espect and acceptance. • Don’t portray people w ith disabilities as overly courageous, brave, special or superhuman. This implies that it’s unusual for people with disabilities to have talents or skills. • Don't use “normal” to describe people who don't have disabilities. It is better to say “people without disabilities ” if necessary to make comparisons. • Never say “wheelchair -bound” or “confined to a wheelchair.” . • Never assume that a person with a communication disorder (speech impediment, hearing loss, motor impairment) also has a cognitive disability . 10 Commandments of Etiquette for Interacting with People with Disabilities When talking with a person with a disability, speak directly to that person rather than through a companion or sign language interpreter. When introduced to a person with a disabi lity, it is appropriate to offer to shake hands. People with limited hand use or who wear an artificial limb can usually shake hands. (Shaking hands with the left hand is an acceptable greeting.) When meeting a person who is visually impaired, always identify yourself and others who may be with you. When conversing in a group, remember to identify the person to whom you are speaking. Don’t be afraid to ask questions when you're unsure of what to do. If you offer assistance, wait until the offer is accepted. Then listen to or ask for instructions. Treat adults as adults. Address people who have disabilities by their first names only when extending the same familiarity to all others. Never patronize people who use wheelchairs by patting them on the head or shoulder. Leaning on or hanging on to a person’ s wheelchair is similar to leaning on hanging on to a person and is generally considered annoying. The chair is part of the personal body space of the person who uses it.

MSSB Train -the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide of 92 Listen attentively when you're talking with a person who has difficulty speaking. Be patient and wait for the person to finish, rather than correcting or speaking for the person. If necessary, ask short questions that require short answers, a nod or shake of the head. Never pretend to unders tand if you are having difficulty doing so. Instead, repeat what you have understood and allow the person to respond. The response will clue you in and guide your understanding. When speaking with a person who uses a wheelchair or a person who uses crutches, place yourself at eye level in front of the person to facilitate the conversation. To get the attention of a person who is deaf, tap the person on the shoulder or wave your hand. Look directly at the person and speak clearly, slowly, and expressively to determine if the person can read your lips. Not all people who are deaf can read lips. For those who read lips, be sensitive to their needs by placing yourself so that you face the light source, and keep hands, cigarettes and food away from your mouth w hen speaking. Relax. Don't be embarrassed if you happen to use accepted, common expressions such as “See you later,” or “Did you hear about that?” that seem to relate to a person's disability.
