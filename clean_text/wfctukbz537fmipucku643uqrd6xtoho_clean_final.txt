Wheat Competitor/Buyer News – French grains agency cut its EU 2010 soft wheat production estimate this week by 1.2 MMT to 133 MMT. India revised its bumper wheat crop estimate higher to 80.28 MMT. Indian government approved 400 TMT of Indian wheat to be exported to Bangladesh. Iraq purchased another 250 TMT of R ussian and Australian wheat this week, bypassing U.S. origin due to price. Here is USDA’s first look at our global competitors in MY 2010/11 … Major Wheat Competitors MY 20 10/11 Production % change MY 20 10/11 Exports % change U.S. 55.6 MMT - 8% 25.0 MMT - 7% EU-27 145.1 2MMT + 4% 18.0 MMT - 18% Canada 24.5 MMT - 8% 17.5 MMT + 6% Australia 22 MMT - 2% 14.5 MMT + 7% Argentina 12 MMT + 25% 4.0 MMT - 48% Russia 58 MMT - 6% 17.5 MMT + 3% Ukraine 19.5 MMT - 7% 6.00 MMT - 50% CORN – U.S. corn export sales were below trade exepectations at 819.1 TMT, down 56% from the previous week and 41% from the prior 4 -week average . Expor t sales for new marketing year 2010/11 totaled 120.9 TMT. Corn export shipments last week totaled 1.03 M MT, up 21 % from the previous week and 2% from the prior 4 -week average. USDA’s first S&D report for MY 2010/11 - CORN – May 11 - For MY 0 9/10 which ends Aug. 31, USDA lowered 2009 production (based on final ND crop survey) by 21 million bu to 13.11 billion bu; raised domestic ethanol usage by 100 million bu to 4.4 billion bu ; raised U.S. exports by 50 million bu to 1. 95 billion bu ; and lowered U.S. ending stocks by 1 61 million bu to 1. 738 billion bu. This was below the average pre -report trade estimate and supportive to corn futures. For New Marketing Year 20 11, USDA pegged beginning stocks at 1. 738 billion bu, 2010 production at another record high of 37 billion bu ( up 2% due to a nearly 3% jump in harvested acres to 81.8 million and above trend line yi elds of 163.5 bpa). Domestic feed usage was pegged at 5.35 billion bu (down 25 million bu due), domestic ethanol usage at 4.6 billion bu (up 200 million bu), exports at 2.0 billion bu (up 50 million bu) and U.S. ending stocks at 1.818 billion bu ( up 80 mil lion bu or 5%). This ending stocks projection was 83 million bu below the average pre -report trade estimate of 1. 901 billion bu. Average farm gate price for U.S. corn was pegged at $3. 20-$3.80/bu , compared to $ 3.50-$3.70 in 200 9/10. World corn production was pegged at 835 MMT, up 3 MMT from the current year, while world ending stocks are projected to jump 5 % to 1 54.2 MMT . Corn Competitor/Buyer News – COFCO (Chinese corn buying agency) confirmed it had purchased an additional 6 cargoes of U.S. corn this week – in line with USDA announcement today that China had purchased 239 TMT of U.S. corn for shipment in MY 2010 and 130 TMT to be shipped in MY 2011. The US Grains Council is estimating that China has actually purchased up to 15 cargoes which implies at least another 350 -500 TMT. This is a significant development because it not only represents a resurgence in export demand but also less competition as China has been a net corn exporter in recent years. The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange raised its Argen tine corn production estimate this week to 7 MMT from a previous forecast of 21.4 MMT. Here is USDA’s first look at our global competitors in MY 20 10/11 …

Short covering helped wheat post a modest gain on Tuesday despite a firmer dollar and a bearish S&D report which delivered a higher than e xpected wheat ending stocks estimate for the coming year. Wheat retreated on Wednesday after an early surge under profit -taking pressure . Wheat finished sharply lower today (Thursday) in the face of little fresh supportive news and a higher dollar which tr iggered fund selling. The bottom -line for wheat – remains fundamentally weak which was reinforced by USDA’s bigger than expected domestic and global carryover estimates for the new marketing year 2011 ; wheat will continue to need a steady infusion of inve stment money ( for now that means a combination of short covering and fresh fund buying) to sustain a rally. Fortunately the index funds continue to think wheat is an attractive investment and are maintaining a sizeable long position . Wheat market closes o n Thursday, 5 /13/10… July 2010 Weekly Summary Sept 2010 Weekly Summary Chicago $4.79 Down $.31 ½ $4.96 Down $.30 ¼ Kansas City $4.96 ¾ Down $.24 ¼ $5.08 ½ Down $.24 Minneapolis DNS $5.18 ¼ Down $.23 ¼ $5.28 ¾ Down $.23 ¾ CORN – Corn began the week modestly lower in mostly positioning ahead of Tuesday’s S&D report with losses limited by cooler and wetter conditions this week which were expected to slow planting in some areas. Wee kend frosts reportedly burned back some corn leaves but damage was limited. Corn posted solid gains on Tuesday, boosted by a bullish S&D report which showed lower than expected ending stocks for both Marketing Years 2010 and 2011, based on an improving demand. Corn continued to push marginally higher on Wednesday news that China continued to buy U.S. corn, but gains were limited by a higher dollar, lower energies and increased cash sales. Corn finished lower today (Thursday) under pressure from favorable c rop/weather outlook for the coming week. The bottom -line for corn – corn posted modest gains this week despite pressure from weak outside markets which suggests that corn has more supportive fundamental and technical factors working in its favor ; however an early planting pace in the U.S. along with a jump in acres means a big crop is coming so the upside will need some help from outside markets and/or an unexpected jump in demand from China? Ethanol? July 2010 corn contract closed Thursday, 5/13/10, at $3. 73, up $.01 for the week and the Sept 2010 contact closed at $3. 79 ¾, up $.01 ¼ for the week. Other Major Factors to Watch -  Crude Oil – Crude oil continued under pressure this week as global economic worries re -emerged, particularly focused on the potential long -term impacts from sovereign debt. On the bullish side, projec tions for Chinese oil demand were raised this week to 6.8% increase from last year, up from a previous forecast of 6.2%. Wednesday ’s weekly petroleum report showed stocks continu ing to build … weekly c rude oil stocks increased 1.9 million bbls, compared to an expected build of 1. 3 million bbls; distillates increased 1.4 million bbls, compared to an expected build of 1.15 million bbls; but gasoline stocks showed a bullish draw of 2.8 million bbls, compared to an ex pected build of 4 million bbls.  U.S. w eather /crop watch – Last weekend saw frost across parts of Michigan, northern Ohio, northern Indiana, northern Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, northern and eastern Iowa, northeastern Missouri, northwestern Nebraska and the Dakotas, but most areas avoided a hard freeze and crop damage. However soil temps in many of these areas are now too low for newly seeded corn crops to germinate and emerge. This week saw a couple storm systems move through the PNW and Central U.S., slowing planting in some areas but dri er conditions were expected Friday through mid next week when another storm system was favored for the Northwestern and Central Corn Belt s. The HRW Plains saw good rains this week as well, but some areas of southwestern Kansas and southeastern Colorado m ight have been bypassed. Some areas were expecting c ool temperatures again this week, potentially causing some concerns with frost damage to jointing wheat in the Nebraska panhandle. The 6 -10 and 8-14 day outlook shows warmer and drier conditions, allowing spring wheat and corn crops to get off to a strong start .  El Nino is declared dead but the question now is whether a neutral pattern will persist OR will a La Nina pattern form by late summer, bringing drier than normal conditions to North and South Ame rica and wetter conditions to Australia?  International weather / crop watch – some areas of concern to keep an eye on… about 75% of the Former Soviet Union’s spring grain region remains excessively dry along with Australia’s western region which accounts f or 40% of its production. Meanwhile the Canadian wheat and barley crops are off to a slow start but recent moisture has helped boost top soil moisture after a very dry winter.  Canada – Favorable precipi tation has improved to p soil moisture needed for crop germination and establishment ; however the planting pace remains very slow - estimated to be only 10% completed.

 Europe – Heavy rains continue to benefit vegetative to reproductive winter crops. Spain experienced dry chilly conditions with some light fr ost damage in their barley crop.  Former Soviet Union – The western region - Ukraine and southern Russia –experienced unseasonably dry and warm conditions reducing soil moisture for jointing winter grains but promoting rapid spring/summer crop planting. War m dry conditions persisted in eastern regions. Sources indicate that as much as 75% of the spring grain region remains excessively dry, causing concerns about 2010 production potential.  Middle East – Heavy rains maintained prospects for reproductive to filling winter grains in Iraq and Iran.  Northern Africa – Light showers and near normal temps were favorable for filling winter grains although r ains continued to bypass sou thern Morocco.  China – Warmer weather aided development of both winter and summer crops across North China Plains, except N. Manchuri a where cool weather continues to slow planting and emergence of corn. Cool wet conditions continued in NE China , slowing winter wheat development and delay ing corn planting .  Argentina / Brazil – Argentina saw mostly dry conditions aiding corn harvest and winter grain planting. Southern Brazil received shower benefitting winter grain areas but the north remains mostly dry.  Australia – East/central regions are mostly dry favoring winter grain plant ing; s outheast region continued to receive beneficial moisture that has boosted top soil ahead of winter grain planting; the western region has remain ed mostly dry in recent weeks although the region was starting to see a few showers late this week and mor e extensive coverage is forecast for next week. Precipitation is badly needed to improve planting and emergence of winter grain s.
