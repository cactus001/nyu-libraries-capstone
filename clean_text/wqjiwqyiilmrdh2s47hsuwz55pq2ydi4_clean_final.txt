6 Automobile Body Incineration The information presented in this section has been reviewed but not updated since it was originally prepared because no recent data were found and it is rarely practiced today. Auto bodies arelikely to be shredded or crushed and used as scrap metal in secondary metal production operations, whichare discussed in Chapter 12 (Metallurgical Industry). 6.1 Process Description Auto incinerators consist of a single primary combustion chamber in which one or several partially stripped cars are burned. (Tires are removed.) Approximately 30 to 40 minutes is required toburn two bodies simultaneously. 2As many as 50 cars per day can be burned in this batch-type operation, depending on the capacity of the incinerator. Continuous operations in which cars are placed on aconveyor belt and passed through a tunnel-type incinerator have capacities of more than 50 cars per8-hour day. 6.2 Emissions And Controls 1 Both the degree of combustion as determined by the incinerator design and the amount of combustible material left on the car greatly affect emissions. Temperatures on the order of 650°C(1200°F) are reached during auto body incineration. 2This relatively low combustion temperature is a result of the large incinerator volume needed to contain the bodies as compared with the small quantity ofcombustible material. The use of overfire air jets in the primary combustion chamber increasescombustion efficiency by providing air and increased turbulence. In an attempt to reduce the various air pollutants produced by this method of burning, some auto incinerators are equipped with emission control devices. Afterburners and low-voltage electrostaticprecipators have been used to reduce particulate emissions; the former also reduces some of the gaseousemissions. 3,4When afterburners are used to control emissions, the temperature in the secondary combustion chamber should be at least 815°C (1500°F). Lower temperatures result in higher emissions.Emission factors for auto body incinerators are presented in Table 2.6-1. Particulate matter is likely to bemostly in the PM-10 range, but no data are available to support this hypothesis. Although no data areavailable, emissions of HCl are expected due to the increased use of chlorinated plastic materials inautomobiles. 10/92 (Reformatted 1/95) Solid Waste Disposal 2.6-1
