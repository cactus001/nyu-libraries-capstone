LaThuile Italy / David Finley , Fermilab / March 2007 Slide 7Some uses of Massive LAr Detectors • One use (of particular interest at Fermilab): – An excellent electron neutrino detector in a neutrino beam – Although the neutrino beam itself may only be ~10 microseconds long, the electrons will take ~2 milliseconds to drift to the TPC sense wires – If it can be demonstrated that the cosmic ray background can be handled it may be sensible to locate the detector near the surface (under a few meters of overburden). • Another use: – A detector under (at least ~50 meters of) dirt/rock cover to reduce cosmic ray background – This allows for nucleon decay, supernovae neutrino watches … and it can still be put in a neutrino beam.

LaThuile Italy / David Finley , Fermilab / March 2007 Slide 8Some Features of Massive LAr Detectors • Features of modular approach: – It avoids various problems with large dimension objects – It does not “put all your eggs in one basket”– It allows for a staged turn on of data taking • Light collection is another feature – Provides a trigger for natural processes such as nucleon decay and supernovae … and is very useful for sorting out background tracks in dete ctors in neutrino beams • Feature of long drift: Purity – ICARUS has shown it can be done on 300ton scale – Now it must be done better to be useful for massive scale

LaThuile Italy / David Finley , Fermilab / March 2007 Slide 24Purity Demonstration: 1 • Demonstrate that the purity requ ired by a large liquid argon TPC detector can be achieved without evacuation , and estimate the associated costs. • A credible demonstration must use, as much as possible, the same materials and techniques as expected to be used for a massive detector (e.g., 5kton). Thus, the design of the detector must be sufficiently understood. • The purity demonstration itself does not need a functioning TPC, but it does need to include the TPC materials arranged as in an experiment, and prepared in the same manner as in an experiment. • The present focus is to propose using a 150ton LNG tank constructed by an LNG contractor. – 150tons is scaled down from 5ktons by a factor of 30 – appropriately modified to accommodate a TPC– appropriately cleaned– use appropriately clean techniques to insert the cellular design TPC

LaThuile Italy / David Finley , Fermilab / March 2007 Slide 25Purity Demonstration: 2 • Three steps starting from air in the tank: – Warm argon gas used as a piston • purge oxygen to 50ppm or less • vertical velocity chosen to control diffusion and to be the same as to be used in a 5kton detector – Recirculation of warm argon gas • recirculated through filter scaled down from 5kton • remove water and oxygen, goal is 500ppb• i. e., achieve purity similar to that achieved by ICARUS with evacuation –L i q u i d p u r i f i c a t i o n system similar to ICARUS • Final purity expected to be determined by contaminants from tank walls, TPC materials, flow restrictions due to presence of TPC, leaks, etc.

LaThuile Italy / David Finley , Fermilab / March 2007 Slide 28Cellular Design: An Alternate Wire Layout (A Better Idea, perhaps) In the previous design with angled wires, attached to the tank top, bottom, and sides, there will be so me wires that do not reach all the way to the top. Hence they cannot easily be read out (without electronics immersed in the liquid, for example). Each set of wire planes has 3 planes to detect electrons drifting in from the left, and 3 planes for electrons drifting in from the right. For each plane in the left triplet, there is a corresponding plane, with the same DC potential, in the right triplet. Why not … Connect the short wires on the left, that did not reach the top, to the set of short wires on the right that start not at the tank bottom, but higher up on the wall. Voila: Complete coverage .

LaThuile Italy / David Finley , Fermilab / March 2007 Slide 31Cellular TPC Interpret the previous cross sect ion as that of a panel that forms a “cell” just 3 m wide. The panel is tall enough to re ach the top of the Argon pool. Since a single wire wraps around the cell from the left side to right side, this introduces pa ttern recognition complications. What do we gain ? Panels are made off-site an d shipped (by truck or cargo plane) to the detector site Panels are made while the tank is being built3. Panels are fully tested and cold-shocked4. Panel installation is fast and low-risk
