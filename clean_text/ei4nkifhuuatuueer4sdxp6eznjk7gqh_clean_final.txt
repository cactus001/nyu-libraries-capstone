Washington, DC - Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) was named one of the 2008 Small Business Stars by the National Small Business Association (NSBA) earlier this week. The NSBA chose four House members as Small Business Stars based on their strong dedication to the small business community and their leadership on issues important to small businesses. "I'm honored to be recognized by the National Small Business Association during my first term in Congress," Braley said. "I'm proud that my first bill to pass in the House was one to help small businesses compete. Small businesses are the backbone of Iowa's economy, and I will continue working to ensure that small businesses have the resources they need to grow." Last year, Braley introduced and passed the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act, which would help small businesses compete for government contracts. Braley also introduced and passed the Plain Language Act, which would make government documents easier to understand. Braley is Chairman of the House Small Business Subcommittee on Contracting and Technology.
