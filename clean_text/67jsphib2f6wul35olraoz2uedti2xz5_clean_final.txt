2I. Murra y, a drive r in the Tra nsportation Unit of the De partment, c laims that Benne t sexually harassed him. According to the complaint,“in February 2002, during [Mur ray’s] first week of employment at [the Department][h e] had a conversation with Monica Bennet, Supervisor, in which Supervisor B ennet e xpresse d neg ative per ceptions of men a nd general animosity towards men.” Complaint 2. W hen Murr ay repor ted B ennet’ s comments he wa s immediately reassigne d so that he no long er reporte d to her. The reafter, how ever, Murra y had sever al unpleasa nt contacts a nd experience s with Benne t. For e xample, in April 2002, Murra y was a ssigne d a task by Bennet and wa s told that the task could be complete d at a late r time. When, Murray was unable to complete the task immediately, however, “Bennet issued Murray a written wa rning for insubordination.” I d. On another occa sion, although Mur ray had bee n approve d leave , Bennet neve rtheless “ wrote Mur ray up” for taking leave without approval. On y et another occa sion, Benne t made g raphic sexual comments to Murray when he was standing near three other male employees. According to M urray, Bennet used sexually explic it language whe n she desc ribed he r interpr etation of the de finition of the term “pimp juice” which was wr itten down the leg of his pants. Be nnet then “pr oceeded to assault [Murray ] during the incident, stroking [his] leg, hip, and buttocks reg ion as she spoke w ith [Murra y] in a sexual and seductive ma nner.” Id at 4. According to Murray , he re ported these incidents to persons in authority at the Depa rtment and wr ote a letter to the May or’s Of fice, but nothing wa s done. I nstead B ennet wa s allowed to do var ious things which Murr ay char ges we re a form of r etaliation for his ha ving made a complaint ag ainst her.

3II. A. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies The district moves to dismiss this case on the grounds that Murray has failed to allege that he has e xhausted his administrative re medies. Reciting familiar leg al principles, the D istrict correctly points out that a non-federal employee complaining of a violation of Title VII mus t first file an a dminist rative c harge with the EEOC a nd allow the ag ency enoug h time to act on the charge. Only after the EEO C has notified the cla imant of its decision to dismi ss the char ge , or its inabili ty to timely file a c ivil action, can the c laimant bring a lawsuit himself. If a Title VI I plaintiff fa ils to allege that he has e xhausted his administrative re medies, the proper course is to dism iss the plaintiff’s claim without prejudice . 2006 WL 1825796 (D.D.C). Here, Murray neither has alleged that he exhausted his administrative remedies nor, in response to the instant moti on, asser ted that he ha s done so. Acc ording ly, Murra y’s complaint against the District is dismi ssed without prejudice . B. Vicar ious liabili ty of B ennet Title I I prohibits acts of discrimination by an “e mploy er” and make s a cle ar distinction betwee n “per sons” and “ employ ers.” 42 U.S.C.§ 2000e-2(a ). The sig nificanc e of this distinction for Murr ay is that he is unable to maintain a Title VI I action ag ainst Be nnet in her individual capacity. Gary v Long , 59 F3d 1391, 1399( D.C. Cir.), cer t. denied, 516 U.S. 1011,133 L .Ed. 2 493, 116 S.Ct . 569 (1995).
