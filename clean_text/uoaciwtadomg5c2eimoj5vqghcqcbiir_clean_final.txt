I-12 OVERVIEW The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has identified more than 80 Federal programs that provide cash or noncash assistance (including medical care) directed primarily to persons with limited income, as determined either through need-based eligibility criteria or targeting provisions (Congressional Research Service, 2006). These programs do not include social insurance, such as Social Security and Medicare. These need-based or targeted program s in fiscal year (FY) 2004 cost an estimated $583 billion: $427 billion in Federal funds and $156 billion in State and local funds. More than half (55 percent) of this spending supported medical care, although programs providing medical care comprised only 8 of the more than 80 programs. Excluding the cost of medical care, need-based assistance programs cost an estimated $261 billion in FY2004 ($232 billion in Federal funds and $28 billion in State and local funds). Expressed in constant FY2004 dollars, to tal need-based spending increased by $21.5 billion (3.8 percent) from the 2003 level. However, this increase was dominated by a $19 billion increase in spending for medical assistance. Real spending for all other (nonmedical) forms of need-based assistance increased by

--- Page 1 ---
I-2 slightly more than $2 billion from FY2003 to FY2004, or by less than 1 percent. Real spending increases from FY2003 to FY2004, by form of benefit, included: food benefits ($3.3 billion); cash aid ($2.4 billion); and housing ($0.6 billion). Real spending decreases included: education benefits ($2.3 billion); jobs and training ($0.9 billion); services ($0.6 billion); and energy aid ($0.2 billion). Spending for “human capital” programs (those providing education or employment and training activities) accounted for 6.2 percent of all dollars spent in FY2004 on persons with limited income, compared with 19.2 percen t for cash assistance and 55.3 percent for medical care. As a percentage of nonm edical spending only, “human capital” programs accounted for 13.9 percent, compared with 42.9 percent for cash assistance. The composition of need-based spending differed by type of benefit, with the Federal Government sharing the cost of medical care with States and localities to a much greater extent than for other forms of need-based assistance. Specifically, the Federal Government paid 60 percent of the total cost of need-based medical care in FY2004, but paid 89 percent of the cost of nonmedical benefits. Medical care consumed nearly 82 percent of all State and local need-based spending in FY2004, but accounted for less than 46 percent of Federal need-based spending in that year. PARTICIPATION IN NEED-BASED PROGRAMS An unduplicated count of beneficiaries in need-based programs is not available. During the 2002-2004 period, enrollment in TANF and food stamps remained far below the peak levels of 1994-1995 (although food stamp enrollment rose from the 2000-2002 period), while Medicaid enrollment set a record high. Average monthly numbers of recipients for selected programs in FY2004 were: Food stamps, 24.9 million; Supplemental Secu rity Income (SSI), 7.1 million; and TANF, 4.7 million. EITC payments went to an estimated 19.2 million tax filers and 56.1 million persons received Medicaid services in FY2004 (Congressional Research Service, 2006). Census Bureau data indicate that 5.8 million families with children were poor in 2004 before receiving cash aid from TANF, General Assistance (GA) or the EITC (compared with 5.1 million in 2002 and with 6.7 million in 1996, the last full year of th e pre-TANF welfare program) (Census, 2006a). The Census Bureau examined participation in major means-tested government programs in 2004 (Census, 2006b). It found that 25 million poor persons (two out of three persons with pre-tax money income below the poverty threshold) lived in a household that received some form of means-tested assistance that year. More than one-half of the poverty population (54 percent) was in a Medicaid-recipient household. More than one-third of the poor population (36.2 percent) lived in a household that received food stamps; for means-tested cash assistance, the proportion was 20.4 percent; and for subsidi zed or public housing, 16.1 percent. Out of the total U.S. population (all income levels), the Census Bureau reported that 4 percent lived in a household that received some form of major means-tested

I-3 aid in 2004 (Medicaid, 20.4 percent; means- tested cash assistance, 6.4 percent; food stamps, 7.5 percent; and public or subsidized housing, 3.7 percent). TRENDS IN SPENDING The CRS data series provides annual spending figures for 32 fiscal years (1968, 1973, and 1975-2004), spanning a 36-year period of time. Total expenditures on cash and noncash need-based programs (including medical care measured in constant 2004 dollars, 1 grew at an annual rate of 5.4 percent between 1968 and 2004. However, the growth pattern was uneven. Real spending almost tripled in the first 10 years, declined in some years (1979, 1982, 1996, and 1997), and in the last 7 years rose at an annual rate of 3.7 percent. Total per capita need-based spending grew in real terms (constant FY2004 dolla rs) from $442 in FY1968 to a peak of $1,989 in FY2004. When these trends are examined by type of benefit, the analysis is dramatically different for medical spending versus nonmedical. In constant FY2004 dollars, spending for medical care grew at an average annual growth rate of 2 percent between 1968 and 2004. At the same time, real spending for nonmedical forms of need-based assistance grew at an average annual rate of 4.1 percent. Real spending for medical car e increased in every year except 1982 and 1996; spending for nonmedical care declined in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1987, and again in each of 1995 through 2000. Total per capita spending for need-based medical care grew from $132 in FY1968 to $1,100 in FY2004, while per capita spending for nonmedical forms of need-based assistance grew from $310 to $889. 1 Current dollars were translated into FY2004 constant value dollars by use of the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI-U).

Measured in constant 2004 dollars, Federal spending fo r all need-based benefits climbed from $62.8 billion in fiscal year 1968 to $427.1 billion in fiscal year 2004, an increase of 580 percent. As the table shows, cash aid was the leading form of Federal need-based spending until 1980, when it was overtaken in value by medical benefits. Two years later, in 1982, Federal spending d eclined for all forms of need-based aid except subsidized housing (because outlays reflected earlier commitments) and

--- Page 4 ---
I-5 education benefits. In most subsequent years, aggregate real Federal spending for need-based assistance steadily increased, except in 1986, 1996, and 1997. Looking at medical assistance only, Federal spending grew from $15.1 billion in FY1968 to $194.8 billion in FY2004, for an increase of 1,190 percent. Federal spending for all other forms of need-based aid rose from $47.4 billion in FY1968 to $232.3 billion in FY2004, for an increase of 390 percent. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS Table I-3 shows that State and local spending for need-based benefits, measured in FY2004 dollars, climbed from $25.9 billion in fiscal year 1968 to $156.2 billion in FY2004, an increase of 502 percent. Cash aid was overtaken by medical benefits as the dominant form of State and local need-based spending in State and local spending rose steadily in all years after 1979, except for 1993, 1996 and 2003. Looking at medical assistance only, State and local spending grew from $11.4 billion in FY1968 to $127.8 billion in FY2004, for an increase of 1,025 percent. State and local spending for all other forms of need-based aid rose from $14.6 billion in FY1968 to $28.5 billion, for an increase of 195 percent. TOTAL SPENDING Table I-4 shows total (Federal plus State and local) spending on need-based benefits in FY2004 dollars. Total spending rose from $88.8 billion in FY1968 to $583.3 billion in FY2004; as noted earlier, this was an increase of 557 percent. Aggregate spending rose in all years except 1979, 1982, 1996, and 1997. Real spending for medical benefits reached a new historic peak in fiscal year 2004. For other forms of benefits, however, peak spending took place in earlier years: jobs and training, 1978; energy, 1981; cash aid, 1995; food aid, 1994; housing benefits, 1996; education, 2003; and services, 2003. Looking at medical assistance only, total spending increased from $26.5 billi on in FY1968 to $322.6 billion in FY2004, for an increase of 1,119 percent. As noted earlier, total spending for all other forms of need-based aid rose from $62.3 billion in FY1968 to $260.7 billion in FY2004, for an increase of 318 percent. SHARE OF FEDERAL BUDGET USED FOR NEED-BASED BENEFITS The share of the Federal budget used for need-based benefits averaged 13 percent from 1975 to 1979, dropped to 12 percent in the 1980s, and since 1994 has equaled or exceeded 17 percent in each year. In 2001 it rose above 18 percent, and in 2004 was 18.6 percent.
