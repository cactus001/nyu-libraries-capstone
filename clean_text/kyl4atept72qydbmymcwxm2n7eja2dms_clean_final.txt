Comptroller Gmenral of the Ualt.4 States Wnh} elmton, D.C, 20648 Decision Matter of MUil-Base Industries, Inc. File: B-269949 Date: January 23, 1995 DECISION MlU-Base Industries, Inc. protests the award of a contract to A.I.W, Alton by the. Defense General Supply Center, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), under solicitation No. SP0440-94-R-1128. MU-Base challenges the determination that A.I.W. Alton is a responsible contractor. We dismiss the protest. A determination that a bidder or 6f.eror is capable of perforning a contract is based, in large measure, on subjective Judgments which gederally are not susceptible to'reasoned review, Whether the'awaidee had the ability and intention of complying with the requirements Is slnipl'y a matter for thedcontracting officer, in the exercise of her discretionary business Jildgthent, to consider in making the respai&f.it.. detetrdna tion. An agency's atftiuiative determinztion of a contracto ds respofsibiliy:Y illnot be reviewed by our Office absent a showing of possible 1ud or bad faith' on the part of proclirement officials, or that definitive responsibity cuiteri& in the solicitation may haye been misap'plied. 4 C.F.R. § 21.3(m)(5); MngFiru Co.,- B'-2'36587,2, Feb. 12, 1990, 90-1 CPD 1 177, WhUe MUl- Base alleges that a more thorough investigation or pte-award survey would have shown that A.I.W. Alton was not responsible, thai, even if true. does not establish that the agency may have acted fraudulUntly or in bad faith. It Is simply' up to the agency, which must bear the burden of deficient contract performance, to decide what is necessary in order to determine if a bidder or offeror Is capable of performing the contract. DLA's approach--which did not include a pre-award survey-therefore is a permissible one and provides no basis for our review of this muatter. Ronald Berger Associate General Counsel
