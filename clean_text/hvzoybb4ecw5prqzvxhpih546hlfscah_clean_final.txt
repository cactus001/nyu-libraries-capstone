USWRP Goals relating to hurricane landfall forecasting  To reduce landfall track and intensity forecast errors by 20%.  To increase warning lead-time to and beyond 24 hours with 95% confidence without increasing the present 3-to -1 over warning.  To make skillful (compared to persistence) forecasts of gale- and hurricane-force radii out to 48 hours with 95% confidence.  To extend quantitative precipitation forecasts out to 3 days and enhance skill of day-3 predictions to improve inland flooding forecasts.

JHT: The Process • Call for Proposals – drafted and disseminated (bi-annually) • Principal Investigators apply for funding through NOAA • 7 member Steering Committee rates all proposals • Funded projects are tested during 1 or 2 hurricane seasons in conjunction with NHC/EMC points of contact • At the project’s end, each are evaluated by NHC/EMC staff • Implementation of successful projects are then carried out by NHC/EMC staff/PIs
