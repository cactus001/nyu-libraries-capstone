viii Foreword The purpose of this manual is to provide guida nce on the development and implementation of a cross-connection control (CCC) pr ogram that will comply with the drinking water regulations, Chapter 246-290-490 Wash ington Administrative Code. This manual was prepar ed for Group A public water systems with le ss than 1,000 connections. Although the elements of a CCC program for small, medi um, and large water systems are essentially the same, a sma ll water system program may often be streamlined to: • Suit the lower health risk posed by a pr edominantly residential customer base; and • Reduce the purveyor's program administra tion, and thus, oper ating costs. This manual is divided into the following general areas: • Chapters 1 through 5 provide an ove rview of cross-connection control; • Chapter 6 outlines the deci sions to be made when starting a CCC program; • Chapter 7 addresses day-to-day program operation; • Chapter 8 contains the CCC regulations and related referenc e materials; and • The appendices provide refere nce materials, including sa mple written pr ogram plans. This manual may be viewed and downloaded from Washington State Department of Health Office of Drinking Water website: http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/dw For purveyors without Internet acces s, a CD of the manual is availa ble upon request from the Office of Drinking Water.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 1 Chapter 1. Purpose The purpose of this gu idance manual is to: • Explain the need for a cross-co nnection control (CCC) program; • Summarize Washington State Department of Health (DOH) regulatory requirements for developing and implementing a CCC program; • Outline the options ava ilable for complying with CCC regulations; and • Provide information to assist purveyors with the day-to-d ay implementa tion of a CCC program. This manual is designed to prov ide guidance and resource informat ion on cross-connection control to DOH-certified cross-connection control specialis ts, CCC program managers , public water system managers, water system governing bodies, pub lic water system lega l counsel, and Local Administrative Authorities (building/plumbing o fficials). The manual was developed for Group A public water systems with le ss than 1,000 connections. For small water systems that co ntract with a DOH-certified cross-connection control specialist (CCS) for development of a program, this manual can be used as a re source to help ensure that the contractor’s program includes all the elem ents discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. Throughout this manual, the terms must, shall , and required are used to indicat e a Washington State regulatory requirement. The terms should or recommend are used to indicate recommended procedures, schedules, and/or criteria.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 2 Chapter 2. Introduction 1 Overview of Cross-Connection Control A cross connection is defined as any actual or potential ph ysical connection be tween a public water system or the consumer's water syst em and any source of non-potable liquid, solid, or gas that could contaminate the potable water supply by backfl ow. Cross connections exist in all plumbing systems. Cross connections may also exist in the purveyor’s water system facilities. There are numerous well-documented cases where drinking water has been contaminated via unprotected cross connections. These cases have caused illness, injury, and in some cases, death, to consumers served by the system. The task of eliminating all cross connections is enormous. However, all purveyors can implement CCC programs that reasonably redu ce the risk of contamination to their systems. For a drinking water (potable water) supply to become contamin ated via a cross connectio n, three things need to happen simultaneously : The potable water supply piping must be un protected (or improperly protected) from a cross connection; A physical cross connection must be made between the potable wate r supply piping and a contaminant source; and Backflow conditions must occur. Backflow is the flow of water (or othe r solid, liquid, or gas from any source) back into the potable water supply. Backflow may be due to either: • Backsiphonage; or • Backpressure. 2 Causes of Backfl ow: Backsiphonage Backsiphonage is backflow caused by a negative pressu re (vacuum or partial vacuum) in the supply piping. Backsiphonage occurs when system pressu re is reduced below atmo spheric pressure. The effect is similar to sipping water through a straw. The following scenario ill ustrates how backsiphonage backflow conditions could oc cur in a public water system: • A public water system main is shut off to repair a leak. The water main is at the base of a hill.

--- Page 15 ---
_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 2 • The water main is at a lower elevation than th e homes on the hill. This creates a situation where water in the plumbing in the homes on the hill can drain into the public water system main. • When a customer at the bottom of the hill uses water, a siphon is cr eated at households at the top of the hill and water drains out of their plumbing systems. • At one household at the top of the hill, a gard en hose is being used to fill a child's wading pool. The hose is submerged in the pool. S ee Illustration 1. • When the backflow conditions occur, th e non-potable water from the wading pool is siphoned through the cross conn ection (submerged hose) in to the household plumbing and then into the water main. • The water from the wading pool contaminates the water main. • When water service is restored, contaminated water is delivered to customers served by the public water system. See Illustration 1. Illustration 1 Backsiphonage Backflow Hazard

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 2 2.3 Causes of Backfl ow: Backpressure Backpressure is backflow caused by pres sure in the customer's plum bing being greater than the pressure in the water supply piping . The higher pressure in the customer's pl umbing may be from a booster pump, heating boiler, etc. The following scenar io illustrates how backpressure backflow could occur in a water system: The fire department withdraws water from a hydrant. This reduces the pressu re in the public water system main from 50 pounds per square inch (psi) to 20 psi. A customer served by the public water system installed a lawn irri gation system. The customer’s irrigation system is supplied with water from a pond. The pump supplying the irrigation system operates at 30 psi. To en sure a supply for the irri gation system when the pond is dry, the customer inst alled a standby connec tion to the household plumbing (potable water piping). On the day of the fire fl ow situation, the nor mally closed valve between the household plumbing and irrigation piping is accidentally left open. Backflow wouldn’t normally occur at this customer’s connection, be cause the pressure in the public water system is gr eater than the pressure supplied by the irrigation pump. However, during the fire flow si tuation, the pressure from the irrigation pump is greater than the pressure in the water ma in. Water from the pond is pumped into the household plumbing, and then into th e public water system main . See Illustration 2. When the fire flow ends, pr essure in the public water system water main increases, and contaminated water is delivered to customers served by the system. See Illustration 2.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 2 Illustration 2 Backpressure Backflow Hazard 4 Methods of Backflow Prevention Backflow can be prevented in two wa ys, either throug h installation of: An approved air gap (AG) th at provides a physical separation between the contaminant and the drinking water supply; or Mechanical devices or assemblies that prevent ba ckflow from occurring. Air gaps (AGs) are commonly used to prevent back flow in household plumbing systems. Examples of AGs can be found in typica l household kitchens and bathr ooms. The physical separation between the kitchen faucet and kitchen sink rim is an approved AG. Si milarly, the physical separations between the bathroom faucets and rims of the sinks an d bathtubs are ap proved AGs. Current plumbing codes requ ire all sinks and bathtubs sold in th e United States to have “built in” approved AGs (designed for abov e the rim faucets) to prevent contamination of the household plumbing. In addition to AGs, there are several methods of preventing backflow by mechanical means. These range from simple single check valves to elaborate approved backflow prevention assemblies. All mechanical devices and assemblie s will prevent backflow to some degree when properly installed and maintained. However, not all mechanical devices and assemblies are created equal. Thus, not all mechanical devi ces and assemblies provide equivalent backflow protection.

--- Page 18 ---
_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 2 In fact, backflow preventers can be differentiated by a number of characteristics: Backflow application conditions; Degree of hazard; Design; Approval requirements; and Use for premises isolation. These characteristics are important to consider wh en deciding which type of backflow preventer to use to protect the public water system from contamination. The discussion below provides further detail. Regarding backflow application conditions , some devices and assemblies are designed to prevent backsiphonage backflow only. These ar e not effective in preventing backflow under backpressure conditions. Others are designed to prevent both backsiphonage and backpressure backflow. When selecting a backflow preventer to protect the public water system, the purveyor must make sure that the preventer is suitable for the backflow application conditions likely to occur for a particular connection (or fixture). Backflow preventers must also be commensurate with the degree of health hazard (high vs. low) posed by the customer’s plumbing system (or fixtur e) to the public water system. For example, some backflow preventers (i.e., assemblies) are manufactured to a very high standard, and thus, are more reliable in preventing backflow than devices manufactured to a lower standard. The more reliable assemblies must be used to pr event backflow in high hazard cross-connection situations. Regarding backflow preventer design , an important difference between various types of backflow preventers is whether th e design allows them to be tested and repaired while in-line. The purpose of the testing is to determine wh ether they are properly functioning to prevent backflow. Preventers that are not testable are called devices , whereas assemblies are preventers designed for in-line testing and repair. Assemb lies include isolating valves and test cocks. Regarding approval status , in Washington, backflow preventers that protect public water systems from contamination via cross co nnections must appear on the Backflow Prevention Assemblies Approved for Installation in Washington published by DOH. Yet, not all backflow preventers appear on the approved list. Th e list identifies only those asse mblies that have successfully completed rigorous laboratory and field tests conducte d by the University of Southern California’s Foundation for Cross-Connection Co ntrol and Hydraulic Rese arch. It is important for purveyors to ensure that all assemblies relied upon to protect the public water system ap pear on the above named list.

--- Page 19 ---
_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 2 The last difference between the various types of back flow preventers is whether they can be used to isolate the customer’s plumbing from the public wate r system distribution system. This concept is called premises isolation . Premises isolation asse mblies are usually located at the meter or property line. Some assemblies ca n be used for premises isolation, whereas others are used to prevent backflow at fixtures only. The concept of installi ng a backflow preventer at a particular fixture, such as a boiler, is called fixture protection . When selecting a backflow preventer for a specific situation, it is important to consider whether the preventer is to be used for premises isolation or fixture protection. Note: Washington Admini strative Code (WAC) 24 6-290-490(4) mandates premises isolation for hi gh hazard premises. The following list identifi es mechanical backflow preventers available on the market and their respective acronyms. The lis t identifies non-testable devices first and then id entifies testable assemblies . Devices a. Residential Meter Check / Single-Check Valve (CV) b. Dual-Check Backflow Preventer (DCV) c. Dual-Check with Atmospheric Vent (DCAV) d. Hose Bibb Vac uum Breaker (HBVB) e. Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker (AVB) Assemblies a. Spill-Resistant Vacuum Breaker Assembly (SVBA) b. Pressure Vacuum Breaker Assembly (PVBA) c. Double-Check Valve Assembly (DCVA) d. Double-Check Detector Assembly (DCDA) e. Reduced-Pressure Backflow Assembly (RPBA) f. Reduced-Pressure Det ector Assembly (RPDA) Note: The term "detector " in the above assemblies list refers to a small water meter installed in a by-pass arrangement for detection of water use. These are most often us ed for fire sprinkler installations.

--- Page 20 ---
_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 2 For protection of a public water system from contamination, DOH recognizes as acceptable methods of backflow prevention approved : Air gaps (AG); Reduced-pressure backflow assemblies (RPBA); Reduced-pressure detect or assemblies (RPDA); Double-check valve assemblies (DCVA); Double-check detector assemblies (DCDA); Pressure vacuum breaker assemblies (PVBA); Spill-resistant vacuum breaker assemblies (SVBA); and Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB). As mentioned previously, WAC 246-290-490 (4) requires premis es isolation for high-hazard premises. These premises must be isolated fr om the public water system by an approved AG or RPBA. Other assemblies, such as DCVAs, may be used for premises isolation for lower hazard situations. Table 1 shows which backflow preventers are suitable for various combinations of backflow application conditions and health hazards that purv eyors may encounter. For premises that are not considered high hazar d, the purveyor may rely on assemblies and/or devices installed within the customer’s plumbing system to protect the public water system. Note: The latter is allo wed, because the back flow assemblies and/or devi ces installed within the customer's plumbing system reduce the health risk to a level where an ap proved assembly is not required at the meter to protect th e public water system. Devices may be used where an approved assembly is not required.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 3 Chapter 3. State and Federal Regulations and Jurisdictions 1 Overview of Federal and Sta te Drinking Water Regulations The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) passed by Congress in 1974 authori zed the development of national regulations to ensure safe drinking water for consumers serv ed by public water systems. The 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act and subs equent amendments (through 2002) do not specifically address the topi c of cross-connection control. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is currently c onsidering development of federal CCC rules. Thus, federal CCC rules may be promulgated sometime in the future. Current federal drinki ng water rules do not specifically require the purveyor to have a cross- connection control program. Confusion about cross-connection control has arisen, due to the belief by some purveyors that, under the SDWA, the "purveyor is re sponsible for water quality to the last free-flowing tap." This confusion may have resulted from some federal rule s that require purveyors to monitor certain water quality parameters (i.e., lead and copper levels) in samples collected at the customer's tap. However, under the SDWA, purvey ors are only responsible for th e water quality delivered to customers at the meter. The purveyor is not responsible for contaminants added to the water by circumstances under the control of the cu stomer (i.e., beyond the meter). Under federal rules, the purveyor is only responsible for the water quality delivered to the customer’s meter. Under the SDWA, the federal g overnment may grant state go vernments "primacy" for the administration and enforcement of the federal drinking water regulatio ns. States with primacy must adopt drinking water regulatio ns that are at least as stringent as the federal drinking water rules. Washington is a primacy state.

--- Page 23 ---
_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 3 Besides adopting the federal drin king water rules, primacy states may adopt additional (or more stringent) drinking water regulations as long as they are not in conflic t with the SDWA and/or federal rules. In Washington, CCC requirements are state-imposed. Simila rly, lower levels of government (e.g., counties an d cities) within the stat e, with the authority of the state, may impose additional (or more stringent) regulations as lo ng as they are not in conflict with the state regulations. Both federal and state g overnments regulate the public health aspects of drinking water “to protect the health, safety, or welfare of the users of water.” These regulatory enti ties “govern the manufacturers and distributors of water” (e.g., wa ter utilities, bottled wate r plants, etc.). Regulations apply to the entity that owns (contr ols) the facilities for the manufacture and/or distribution of water. Th e higher level of governme nt (the State) regulates government entities (e.g., a city or water district) that ow n water utilities. Figure 1 illustrates the hierar chical relationship in the regulatory authority of the federal and state leve ls of government with respect to public water systems.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 3 In Washington State, the laws (statutes) enacted by the legi slature are published in the Revised Code of Washington (RCW). Th e RCWs establish general statutory authority. Subordinate to the RCWs, state agencies or boards, such as the State Board of Health adopt administrative rules through the Washington Ad ministrative Code (WAC). The WACs provide details consistent with the RCWs. In addition to administrative rules, state agencies may issue guidance documents and/or other reference materials on ho w to comply with the RCWs a nd WACs. RCWs and WACs are enforceable by the State, whereas guidelines are not enforceable. Chapter 43 of the Revise d Code of Washington a ssigns to DOH the respon sibility to "Review and approve plans for public water system design, engineering, operation maintenance, financing, and emergency response, as required under State Bo ard of Health rules. " The RCW defines a public water system as “any system, excluding a system serv ing only one single-family residence and a system with four or fewer connec tions all of which serve residen ces on the same farm, providing piped water for human consumption, including any collection, treatment, storage, or distribution facilities under control of the purveyor and used primarily in connection with the system." This definition is consiste nt with the federal SDWA defin ition of a public water system. The definition of public water system goes to th e heart of the regulatory authority of DOH and the purveyors it regulates. For most purveyors, control ends at the water me ter to the customer's premises. The meter woul d be located within a public street right-of-way or within a utility easement. Public water systems where the owner controls (owns) the collection through distribution facilities and the plumbing system would be considered exceptions. These c ould include both non- transient (e.g., schools) and tr ansient (e.g., gambling casino) no n-community syst ems as well as some community systems. WAC 246-290 (Group A Drinking Water Regulations) applies only to the purveyor and not to the purveyor’s customers. 2 Jurisdictions of Washington Sta te Department of Health and Other State Agencies Relating to Cross-Connection Control The state legislature may assign the administration and enforcement of statutes and regulations to different departments (agencies) within state gove rnment. In Washington, several state departments have responsibilities for the admi nistration and/or enfo rcement of CCC -related regulations. These agencies incl ude, but are not ne cessarily limited to: • Washington State Departme nt of Health (DOH);

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 3 • Washington State Buildi ng Code Council (SBBC); • Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I); • Washington State Department of Agriculture; and • Washington State Department of Ecology. The following discussion provides basic information ab out the respective juri sdictions of DOH, the SBCC, and L&I. In ad dition to DOH, the SBCC and L&I have the most potential to impact purveyors. Figure 2 identifies th ese agencies and their respective cross-connection related program responsibilities.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 3 3.2.1 Washington State De partment of Health Regu lates Cross-Connection Control for Public Water Systems As mentioned above, DOH is on e of several agencies with re gulations pertai ning to cross- connection control. DOH Office of Drinking Water administers and enforces drinking water regulations for public water syst ems as set forth in Chapter 246- 290 WAC. The mission of the Office of Drinking Water is to protect the health of the people of Washington State by ensuring safe and reliable drin king water. The requirement for public wate r systems to develop and implem ent CCC programs as set forth in WAC 246-290-490 is consistent w ith the mission of the Office of Drinking Water. Except for certain types of public water syst ems where the consumptio n of water is solely within the property owned by the purveyor, the jurisd iction of WAC 246-290-490 ends at the purveyor's water meter. 2.2 Other State Agencies with Plumbing-Related Cross-Connection Control Responsibilities The primary regulation of plumbing and plumber certification falls under the jurisdiction of two different agencies. Th ese agencies are the: • Washington State Building Code Council (SBCC); and • Washington State Department of La bor and Industries (L&I). The SBCC adopts the Uniform Plumbing Code (U PC) with state amendments specific to Washington (under RCW 19.27). The UPC applies within the propert y lines of the customer's premises. Labor and Industries enforces plumber certification re quirements (under RCW 106). The plumber certification requirements a pply within buildings only. Information on the full text of these statutes is av ailable through the following website: http://www.access.wa.gov/ Further information abou t the respective jurisd ictions of these agencies is provided below. WAC 246-290 applies to the collection, treatment, storage and distribution facilities under the purveyor’s control . RCW 19.27 (Uniform Plumbing Code) applies within the property lines of the customer’s premises . RCW 18.106 (requirement for certified plumbers) applies within buildings only.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 3 Washington State Building Code Council Washington State Building Code Council (SBCC) establishes the minimum requirements for the design and installation of plumbi ng in Washington thro ugh adoption of the Un iform Plumbing Code (often referred to as the UPC). The UPC is applicable statewide. As mentioned above, the UPC applies within the property lines of the customer’s premises . The UPC in effect in Washington includes amendments spec ific to Washington. These includ e a number of CCC amendments. The various departments of state government are not supposed to adopt co ntradictory regulations, including regulations on cross-co nnection control. Thus, during the most recent major revision process of the CCC regulations for Group A public wa ter systems, DOH worked closely with the SBCC to ensure greater consistency between WAC 246-290-490 and th e UPC (as amended for Washington). To ensure this consistency, DOH has continued to work cl osely with the SBCC on subsequent revisions to the UPC. In fact, starting with the 1997 Uniform Plumbing C ode, the SBCC has adopt ed a number of CCC amendments to maintain or enhance consistency with WA C 246-290-490. Information on Washington State’s amendments to the UPC can be foun d on the SBCC website. Their web address is: http://www.sbcc.wa.gov/ Although the SBCC is responsibl e for adoption of the UPC, Local Administrative Au thorities (i.e., local building and/or plumbing offi cials) administer and enforce the UPC. Customers (i.e., owners of potable water plumbing) must co mply with the UPC in effect at the time of installation, whether or not the Local Administrative Au thority inspects the plumbing. Note: RCW 19.27 does not provid e authority for purveyors to regul ate plumbing. In fact, most purveyors have no auth ority, and thus, no resp onsibility, beyond the mete r for the customer's compliance with the UPC. The only exception to this would be systems where the purveyor owns the water supply throu gh distribution facilities and the plumbing. Washington State Department of Labor and Industries Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) require s persons engage d in the craft of plumbing to be certified. Th e craft of plumbing in cludes installing, re pairing and replacing plumbing and applies within buildings only . Some plumbing activities require a journeyman’s plumber certificate, whereas other plumbing activities, such as backflow assembly repair, require only a specialty plumber certificate. The plumber certification requir ements may impact some DOH-cer tified Backflow Assembly Testers (BATs) working in a pu rveyor’s service area. WAC 246 -290-490 and the UPC (WAC 51- 3) both require DOH-certified BATs to conduct backflow prev ention assembly (BPA) testing. RCW 18.106 requires certified jo urneyman plumbers to install backflow prevention assemblies within buildings.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 3 In 2001, RCW 18.106 was amen ded and a new specialty plumbe r certification for backflow assembly maintenance an d repair was created. Effective January 1, 2003, BATs that repair backflow prevention assemblies within buildings must hold a valid special ty plumber certificate issued by L&I. Further information on the plum bing certification laws and regulations can be obtained by accessing the following website: http://www.lni.wa.gov/scs/plumbing/ Summary In summary, a DOH-certified BAT must test any assembly that the purveyor relies upon to protect the public water system. However, only a journe yman plumber or a DOH-cer tified tester holding a current specialty plumbing certification may repair th e assembly if it is located within a building. Purveyors may wish to recommend that any customer with one or more in-premises assemblies hire a DOH-certified BAT that also ho lds a specialty plumbing certifi cate (in case the customer’s assembly needs to be repaired).

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 3 3.3 History of Cross-Connection Co ntrol Regulations in Washington Chapter 246-290 WAC is the pr imary document currently used by DOH to administer the RCWs that address public water systems and the protectio n of drinking water. Si nce 1970, public water systems in Washington have been required to de velop CCC programs to prot ect their systems from contamination. In fact, the 1978 cross-connection regulations (WAC 248-54-820) included essentially all the progra m requirements of the current WAC 246-290-490. Specifically, WAC 248- 54-820 included the following statement: "A continuing and aggressive program of cross-connection in vestigation, su rveillance and control shall be implemented accordi ng to good CCC practice such as Accepted Procedure and Practice in Cross- Connection Control Manual - Pac ific Northwest Section - American Waterworks Association, Second Edition ." The current WAC 246-290-490 differ s from previous regulations by: • Clarifying the jurisdiction of the water purve yor versus Local Administrative Authority (e.g., local building and plum bing officials) with regards to cross-connection control; • Listing and providing details on the minimum elements of a CCC program, rather than merely referencing the CCC manual published by the Pacifi c Northwest Section of the American Water Works Asso ciation (PNWS-AWWA); and • Identifying specific categories of high hazar d premises for which pr emises isolation is mandated. Details on the current CCC regula tions are provided in Chapter 4. A copy of WAC 246-290-490 is provided in Chapter 8.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 4 Chapter 4. Cross-Connection Cont rol Regulations for Public Water Systems in Washington State This chapter contains detailed information about the CCC require ments set forth in WAC 246-290- A copy of th e WAC (including CCC-relate d definitions from WAC 2 46-290-010) is included in Chapter 8. 1 Applicability All Group A community and non- community public water system s must comply with the CCC requirements of WAC 246-290-490. 2 Overview of Regulations WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyors to develop and implement CCC programs to protect their systems from contamination via cr oss connections. The specific purpose of a CCC program is to protect public health by helping to ensure the quality of water delivered to customers. This is accomplished by protecting the collection, treatment, storag e and distribution facilities under the control of the purveyor from contamination vi a cross connections. Regarding program development, WAC 246-290-4 90 requires purveyors to include a written description of the CCC program in the purveyor’s Water System Plan (required in WAC 246-290- 100) or Small Water System Management Program (required in WAC 246- 290-105). If you are unsure whether your system must develop a Water System Plan or Small Water System Management Program , consult WAC 246-290-100 and 246-2 90-105 respectively and/or your DOH regional engineer. In addition to the written program plan, the regulations specifically require purveyors to implement their CCC programs. This is because imp lementation is the key to protecting the health of consumers served by the water system . Implementation activities incl ude, but are not limited to: • Hazard surveys; • Installation of backflow preventers to protect the public water system; • Establishing a record-keeping system; • Tracking assembly test reports; and • Public education.

--- Page 31 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 4 Note: No public health protection is obtain ed when a system develops but fails to implement its cross-connection control program! The WAC gives purveyors the option to implement their cross-connection programs, or any part, directly or by means of a contract with another agency or party acceptable to DOH. Regarding program development and implementa tion, the general CCC program requirements established by WAC 246-290-490: Require purveyors to use good engineering and public health protection practices. Give purveyors the option to use as guidan ce the most recently publis hed editions of the following publications (in a ddition to DOH publications): a. Manual of Cross-Connection Control , published by the University of Southern California Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research; and b. Cross-Connection Control Manual, Accepted Procedure and Practice , published by the Pacific Northwest Section, Am erican Water Works Association. Give purveyors the option to establish CCC pr ogram requirements that are more stringent than the requirements specified in the WAC. Under WAC 246-290-49 0, purveyors must ensure that cross connections between the distribution system and a consumer's water system are eliminated or controlled. In most cases, eliminating cross connections is almost impossible. Thus, control of cross connections is the more common approach used to protect public water systems from cont amination. Under the WAC, control of cross connections must be accomplis hed by the installation of approved backflow preventers commensurate with the degree of hazard. The WAC offers purveyors flexibility in CCC program implementati on. Under the WAC, purveyors have the option to implement two di fferent types of progra ms. Purveyors must implement either: Premises Isol ation Program , where all backflow preventio n assemblies that protect the public water system are located at the custome r’s meter to isolate th e customer’s plumbing system from the public water system distribution system; or Combination program , where premises isolation backflow preventers are installed for high hazard facilities, and for other ty pes of facilities, backflow preven ters are installed for fixture protection (or area isolation) within the customer’s premises.

--- Page 32 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 4 Regardless of the type of pr ogram implemented, WAC 246-290- 490 requires all purveyors to comply with the mandatory premis es isolation requirements for hi gh hazard facilities of the type listed on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490. Thus, purveyors that implement combination programs must ensure that all high hazard f acilities they serve are isolated fr om the public water system with an approved backflow preventer commensurate wi th the degree of hazard (RPBA or AG). Where mandatory isolation is no t required under the WAC, purv eyors may rely on in-premises protection in lieu of premises isolation. Purveyors implemen ting combination programs often choose this option for n on-high hazard premises with limited internal cross-connection hazards. This option is usually less costly for the customer, since the asse mblies used for fixture protection are smaller than assemblies used for premises isolation. In situations where the purveyor relies upon fixtur e protection to protect th e public water system, the WAC requires purveyors to ensure that the level of protection provided by the in-premises assemblies is equivalent to the level of protectio n that would be provided by a premises isolation assembly. The WAC specifies a nu mber of conditions that must be met to ensure the equivalent protection. In-premises backflow preventers relied upon by the purveyor to protect the public water system must: • Be commensurate with the degree of hazard; • Appear on the list of asse mblies approved by DOH; and • Be installed, inspected , tested, maintained, and repaired in acco rdance with the same requirements that premises isolatio n backflow preventers must meet. In addition to the above conditions , the WAC requires purveyors to keep the same ty pe of records on in-premises backflow preventers as for the premis es isolation assemblies. Last of all, where the purveyor relies on in-premises preventers to pr otect the public water system, the purveyor must have access to the consumer’s premis es to conduct an initial hazard su rvey and periodic resurveys. In summary, under WAC 246-290-490, purveyors are only requi red to maintain records on the assemblies that are relied upon to protect the public water sy stem from contamination. Thus, for connections with premises isolatio n assemblies, the purve yor must maintain records on the premises isolation assembly only. For connections without premises isolation, the purveyor must maintain records on all in-premises assembli es that are relied upon to prot ect the public water system from contamination.

--- Page 33 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 4 To protect their systems from contamination, pur veyors must take “corrective action” when they become aware of unprotected cross connections and/or customers fail to comply with the purveyor’s CCC requirements. Specifically WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyors to take appropriate corrective actions when: Cross connection exists and is not controll ed commensurate with the degree of hazard; and/or Customer fails to comply with the purveyor's requirements for installation, inspection, testing, maintenance or repair of approved backflow preventers. Under the WAC, purveyors have flexibility in what corrective action to take to protect their systems from contamination. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to the purveyor: Denying or discontinuing water servi ce to the non-complying customer; Requiring the customer to install an appr oved backflow preventer commensurate with the degree of hazard; or Installing an approved backflow preventer for premises isolation. WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyors to coordinate with the Local Administrative Authority (e.g., building or plumbing o fficial) on CCC issues. Similarl y, the Uniform Plumbing Code amended for Washington requires Lo cal Administrative Authorities to coordinate with purveyors on CCC issues. Coordination can rang e from information sharing to implementation of joint programs. Under WAC 246-290- 490, purveyors must docu ment the level of coordination with the Local Administrative Authorities, incl uding the delineation of CCC respons ibilities, in the required written CCC program plan descri bed above. Although recommended, written agreements with the Local Administrative Authority are not required under WAC 246- 290-490. As part of the coordination efforts, the cross-connection re gulations require purveyors to notify the Local Administrative Authority when denying or discontin uing water service to a customer. Backflow results in the unintended return of used water , i.e., water that has left the control of the purveyor, into the distribution sy stem. However, some customers may have heating and/or cooling systems that are designed to intentionally return water to the purveyor’s distribution system. The WAC requires purveyors to prohibit the intentiona l return of used water to their distribution systems. This is becaus e used water has left th e control of the purveyor , is of unknown quality (may contain contaminants) and ma y be at a significantly different temperature than the purveyor’s water supply. Customers with these types of hea ting or cooling systems must dispose of the water in some other manner in lieu of returni ng it to the purveyor’s distribution system.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 4 3 Minimum Elements To be acceptable to DOH, the purveyor’s CCC pr ogram must include the minimum elements specified in WAC 246-290-490( 3). There are 10 minimum program elements listed in the WAC. The requirements for each of the minimum el ements are provided below. Guidance for implementing each of the minimum elements is provided in Chapter 7 of this manual. Element 1: Establish Legal Authority The purveyor must adopt a local ordinance, resolution , code, bylaw, or other written legal instrument that: Establishes the purveyor's legal au thority to implemen t a CCC program; Describes the operating polic ies and technical provisions of the purveyor's CCC program; and Describes the corrective actions used to ensure that consumer s comply with the purveyor's CCC requirements. Guidance for implementing each of these elements is provided in Chapter 7. Element 2: Procedures/Sched ules for Hazard Evaluations The purveyor must develop and implement procedures and sche dules for evaluating new and existing service connections to assess the degree of hazard posed by the consumer's premises to the purveyor's distribution system and notify the consumer w ithin a reasonable tim e frame of the hazard evaluation results. At minimum, th e program shall m eet the following: For new connections made on or after the effectiv e date of the DOH CCC regulations (i.e., April, 1999), procedures shall en sure that an initial evaluation is conducted before service is provided; For existing connections made prior to the effect ive date of the DOH CCC regulations (April, 1999), procedures shall ensure that an initial evaluatio n is conducted in accordance with a schedule acce ptable to DOH; and

Element 3: Procedures /Schedules to Eliminate/ Control Cross Connections The purveyor must develop an d implement procedures and schedules to ensure that: Cross connections are elim inated whenever possible; Cross connections are cont rolled by installation of ap proved backflow preventers commensurate with the degree of hazard (whe n the cross connections can’t be eliminated); and Approved backflow preventers are installed in accordance wi th the requirem ents of WAC 246-290-490(6). Element 4: Provide Qualified Personnel The purveyor must ensure that personnel, includ ing at least one person certified as a CCS, are provided to develop and im plement the CCC program. Element 5: Procedures/Schedules for Ba ckflow Preventer Inspection and Testing The purveyor must de velop and implement procedures to ensu re that approved backflow preventers are inspected and/or tested (as applicable ) in accordance with WAC 246-290-490(7). Element 6: Assembly Testing Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) The purveyor must develop and implement a BPA testing quality assurance/quality control program including, but not limited to, documentation of tester certification and test kit calibration, test report contents, and time fra mes for submitting comple ted test reports. Element 7: Backflow Incident Response Plan The purveyor must develop and implement (when appropriate) pr ocedures for responding to backflow incidents. Element 8: Pu blic Education Purveyors must include information on cross-co nnection control in thei r existing programs for educating consumers about water system operations. Such programs may include periodic bill inserts, public service announce ments, pamphlet distribution, no tification of new consumers and consumer confidence reports.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 5 Chapter 5. Reasons for Cro ss-Connection Control Programs 1 Health Aspects The first and foremost reason fo r developing and implementing a CCC program is to protect the health of consumers se rved by the public wa ter system. This is accomplished by preventing contamination of the public water system via cross connections. The purveyor of a public water system has the re sponsibility to deliver wate r to its consumers that meets all health standards in th e Safe Drinking Water Act and th e Washington State Drinking Water Regulations for Group A systems (Chapter 246-290 WAC). The wa ter should also be desirable from an aesthetic standpo int to reduce the likelihood of consum ers turning to an unapproved water supply. Both the drinking water regulat ions (Chapter 246-290 WAC) an d the DOH Water System Design Standards contain many requirements that help ensu re a safe water supply for consumers served by public water systems. Thes e requirements include: • Source protection requirements (watershed control, wellhead protection); • Treatment design and performance st andards (filtration, chlorination); • Distribution system design and construction (c overed reservoirs, pressure standards); and • Proper operations (certified personnel, wate r quality monitoring, cross-connection control). The greatest health risk to consum ers served by public water system s lies in the in troduction of a contaminant into the public water system. By design, the wa ter distribution system is an efficient means of transporting drinking water to consumers served by the system. However, the distribution system can also become the conduit for the spre ad of a contaminant to a large population. Once introduced into the distribut ion system, a contaminant can move as a “slug.” This type of situation may result in extremely high concentrations in the drinking water. In other situations, the contaminant may become diluted quickly. If this occurs, lower concentra tions of the contaminant will be present in the drinking water. Withou t extensive knowledge of flows in a distribution system, such as those provided by a hydraulic modeling program, purveyors will have a difficult time predicting what will happ en once a contaminan t enters the water distribution system.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 5 There are three categories of co ntaminants of importance to purve yors from a CCC standpoint. These are: Microbiological contaminants ; Chemical contaminants; and Physical contaminants. The following sections discuss the various types of contaminants of concern and their effects on the health of consumers and other aspects of a wate r system. Figure 3 illustrat es the three hazard types and provides examples of each. Figure 3 Types Of Hazard 1.1 Microbiological Contaminants In cross-connection control, waterborne dise ases are the primary public health concern (e.g., cholera, typhoid, giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis). Microbiological organisms that may cause waterborne disease include: b acteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasitic helminths (worms). The risk of a waterborne disease transmitted thro ugh the public water supp ly is a major concern because of the: • Large population that may be exposed to the diseas e in a short timeframe; • Inability to immediately detect contamination (i n fact, the first indicator may be the outbreak of disease); and Physical Compressed Air Steam Hot Water Chemical Pesticides Organics Inorganics Microbiological Giardia Cryptosporidium Potential Hazard

--- Page 40 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 5 • Difficulty in tracing the contaminant source (e.g., Giardia cysts may enter the distribution system from a reservoir or through a cross connection wi th an auxilia ry supply). Contributing to the problem of assessing the relativ e risk to public health of a microbiological contaminant is the issue of infectious dose . The severity of the health effect experienced by an individual consuming drinking water containing a disease-causing microorganism varies by the: Type of organism; Quantity ingested; and Strength of the person 's immune system. Individuals with underdeveloped or weakened immu ne systems, such as in fants, the elderly, and persons receiving treatment for can cer, are more vulnerable to wate rborne diseases than persons with fully functioning immune systems. All microbiological contaminants in drinking water are not necessarily disease-causing organisms. However, their presence in the pu blic water distribution system may be an indirect concern to the purveyor. For example, any coliform bacteria detected through the purve yor's monitoring program will require mitigation measures. These measur es include re-sampling an d possible further action such as flushing, disinfection and issuance of a boil water advisory. In addition, some microbiological contaminants may cause taste and odor problems or cause an increased chlorine demand. In assessing the problem of bacter ia entering the distribution syst em, the following system-specific issues should be consid ered (at a minimum): Source water quality. The quality of the s ource water, if poor, may enhance bacterial growth and re-growth in the dist ribution system. For example, sources with high levels of organics will provide a food source for bacteria that may enter the distri bution system due to a backflow incident. Other quality concerns include water with hi gh turbidity, sulfide bacteria, iron and manganese, etc., that provide a biofilm (slime) or biomass (sediment) in water mains to harbor bacteria. Condition of distribution system piping . The condition of distri bution system piping, if poor, may aid bacterial growth and re-growth in the distribu tion system. For example, corrosive water may cause tuberculation formati on on old, unlined cast iron and steel water mains. The tubercles provide a rough surfa ce that shelters bacteria from chlorine.

--- Page 41 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 5 Status of disinfection . Some purveyors use groundwater as a source of supply and do not chlorinate. The ability and willingness of the purv eyor to carry a chlori ne residual in the distribution system directly impacts bacterial survival and growth within the distribution system. Purveyors that do no t routinely chlorinate their sy stems should be prepared (have the necessary means and a plan of action) to apply emerge ncy disinfection to address unexpected microbiological contamination. Concerns about microbiological contamination may be somewhat different from system to system, since each system is unique. 1.2 Chemical Contaminants With chemical contaminants, the issue of toxi c dose must be consid ered just like with microbiological contaminants. Every chemical will have some effect on th e person being exposed. The severity of the health effect experienced by an individual co nsuming drinking water containing a chemical contaminant depends on the type of ch emical, amount of chemical in the water and the duration of exposure. With chemical contaminants , the severity of health effects increases with dose, i.e., the higher the dose, the more significant the health effect s. Similarly, longer exposures result in more signifi cant health effects. Acute toxic conditions from chemical contaminan ts are of most concern in cross-connection control. Similar to microbiological contaminants, the health effect to an individual consuming a toxic chemical varies by the: Type of chemical; Quantity ingested; and Immune system of the person exposed. For most people, the ingestion of drinking water with a high copper level will likely cause nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and/or headache. However, in a small portion of th e population, i.e., those individuals with an allergy to copper, the health effects can be far worse (c ausing death). Some chemicals may normally have low levels of toxicity to humans. However, when these chemicals are introduced into the water system via cross connections , they may react to form more toxic chemicals. This occurs when the chemi cals introduced via back flow combine with the chemicals intentionally added by the purveyor to treat the water su pply. Chemical contaminants may also react with the pi ping material in the plum bing or distribution system to leach toxic metals into the water. Other ch emicals, such as gasoline, may damage piping materials (e.g., permeation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe) and lead to structural fail ure of the pipe.

--- Page 42 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 5 Some chemical contaminants may adhere strongly to the distribution piping walls and/or plumbing. Once a backflow incident has introd uced chemicals with th is characteristic into the water system, it is extremely difficult and/or virt ually impossible to completely clean/remove the contaminant from the system. There have been well-documented backflow incide nts where the purveyor’s only viable remedy was to repla ce the water main affected by the chemical contaminant. Concerns about chemical contamination may be so mewhat different from sy stem to system, since each system is unique. 1.3 Physical Hazards In addition to microbiological and chemical contam inants, purveyors need to be aware that physical contaminants can also be introduced into the wa ter supply via cross connections. Most physical hazards are also chemical hazards. Examples of "pure" physical hazards are compressed air, hot water and steam. Hot water and/or steam, when pres ent in the potable water supply, may result in the burning of the skin, ey es, etc., of consum ers served by the water system. Gas is another type of phy sical hazard. The public health risks posed by a ga s, such as propane, are of an entirely different dimensio n and magnitude compared to the risks posed by hot water and/or steam. In addition to t oxic effects, propane gas ma y cause an e xplosion. Thus, when conducting hazard eval uations, purveyors need to be aware of potential physical hazards as well as microb iological and chemical hazards. Ju st like the other types of cross- connection hazards, physical hazard s may cause injuries an d even death in cons umers served by the system. 2 Multiple Barrier Concept Protection Afforded Throug h the Purveyor’s Programs Public health protection of drinking water emphasizes prevention of contamination and disease. This preventative approach is based on the multiple barrier concept to public health protection. With this concept, purveyors cr eate multiple barriers or “roadblo cks” between di sease- causing organisms (and other contaminants) and public wate r system consumers. With the multiple barrier concept, the greater the number of barriers, the greater the public h ealth protection a fforded. Most programs implemented by purveyor s, including CCC programs, are barriers in the multiple barrier concept to public health protection. The major barriers established fo r public water systems include: • Protecting Sources of Supply. Source protection programs are designed to prevent microbiological, chemical, and physical contam inants from entering the water supply. Source protection is accomplished through im plementation of watershed control (surface water sources) and/or wellhead protection programs (wells).

--- Page 43 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 5 • Providing Treatment. Treatme nt processes, such as filtration an d primary disinfection, remove, reduce, and/or inactivate contaminan ts (naturally-occurring and human-related) from the raw water. Treatmen t is provided to comply with the maximum contaminant level (MCL) and treatment technique requirements established by the drinking water regulations. • Secondary Disinfection. Secondary disinfection is used to maintain a disinfectant residual in the distribution system to co ntrol microbiological water qualit y (e.g., bacterial re-growth). • Storage. Storage reservoirs provide covered storage and prevent microbiological contamination of the treated water through openi ngs in the reservoir (e.g., screened vents, hatch seals are provided). • Distribution System Design. Purveyors comply with the desi gn, installation and material standards, and provide minimum operating pressu res (e.g., greater than 20 psi during fire flow conditions) to prevent contaminants from entering the distribution system. • Cross-Connection Control Prog rams. These programs help protect the public water system from becoming contaminated via cross connections. Purveyors require premises isolation with approved backflow preventers to prevent contaminants from entering the system from high hazard premises. • Water Quality Monitoring . Monitoring programs provide a means of surveillance of the public water system to detect microbiological and/or chemical contaminants in the water supply. • Operation by Qualif ied Personnel. Purveyors provide DOH-certified treatment plant operators, distribution system managers, and CCS s to ensure proper operation of the water system (all facilities under control of the purveyor). • Emergency Planning. Purveyors establish emergency procedures for correcting problems detected in water quality mon itoring, caused by natural disasters, or created by backflow incidents. Public Health Protection Afforded Through the Plumbing Code and Plumber Certification Law On the customer's premises, th e Uniform Plumbing Code establishes minimum plumbing design, installation and operating requirement s. The purpose of the code is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the occupa nts of buildings. The major elem ents in the plumbing code are: • Supply. Owners must ensure that ther e is an adequate supply of piped potable water for the plumbing system. • Distribution. Owners must install approved material s and follow design requirements to ensure minimum pressure at fixtures.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 5 • Cross-Connection Control. Owners must provide approved backflow preventers at fixtures to prevent contaminants from enteri ng the plumbing system (and drinking water). In addition to the plumbing code, in Washingt on, there are also laws and regulations that require certified individuals to provide plumbing services within buildings. According to the plumber certification laws and regulations , plumbing is to be installed and repaired by certified plumbers (with some exceptions). The public health protection requirements establ ished by federal and state officials are very conservative. They include a high safety fact or for both system desi gn (reliability) and for acceptable levels of contaminants. For example, regulation of chemical contaminants may be based on a possible adverse health effect from the long-term (e.g., 30 years) daily consumption of two liters of water containing a chemical at a level above the maximum contaminant level (MCL). Many of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act requirements address possible long-term health effects of contaminants to consumers. However, contamination of water distribution systems through backflow often results in immediate adverse health effects (illness or death of one or more persons) and/or financial losses . Although cross-connection control is only one of the multiple barriers to protec t water quality, it is one of the most important barrie rs to protect the health of consumers served by a public water system. Some governing bodies que stion the need for purveyors to de velop and implement CCC programs. Some council and board members feel that CCC programs ar e a waste of time and money. However, cross-connectio n control programs are an integral barrier in the multiple barrier concept to public health protection. In fact, without a CCC program, the purveyor’s distribution system may become the weak link in the multiple barrier approach to disease prevention. It is illogical for purveyors to sp end large amounts of money on capital improvements for source water treatment plants, water qua lity monitoring programs, etc., if the distribution system is vulnerable to contaminati on via cross connections. Also, for overall risk and liability management, the benefits of implementing CCC programs are more favorable for purveyors than incurring costs for incident investig ation, cleanup, and settlement of claims. Without a cross-connection control program, the purveyor’s distribution sy stem may become the weak link in the multiple barrier approach to disease prevention.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 5 3 Legal Aspects Once contamination occurs, one or more persons may suffer a loss . The history of backflow incidents reveals that the loss ca n range from a minor financial loss (e.g., the cost of flushing a plumbing system) to the death of one or more persons and a significant financial loss. Whenever there is a backflow incident, on e must assume that litigation w ill follow . The litigation may be based on a violat ion of regulations, a tort actio n, and/or a breach of contract. The purveyor's cross-connection control program must be designed to reasonably reduce the risk of contamination of the public water system and should be designed to reduce the purveyor's exposure to legal liability. In general, the purveyor's liability may flow from the follow ing sources: • Having a statutory/regulatory obligation and failing to follow it (i.e., breach of the law); • Failing to develop a "reasonable" CCC pr ogram and/or failing to take follow-up enforcement action, once the purveyor has specific knowledge of a hazard (i.e., negligence); • Supplying a customer with contaminated water that causes the custom er to suffer a loss (e.g., breach of contract/product liability); • Imposing unreasonable requirements on the cust omer (e.g., requiring an RPBA on all services); • Extending a CCC program beyond the purveyor's jurisd iction (e.g., insp ecting plumbing and enforcing the Uniform Plumbing Code); and • Misrepresenting the actions of the purveyor (i.e., making an implied contract). The purveyor’s liab ility may include: Fine or imprisonment for a breach of a statute; and/or

--- Page 46 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 5 Payment of monetary damages, including: a. Court costs; b. Fees of opposing lawyer; c. Compensatory damages; and d. Punitive damages. The following is an exampl e of a statute pertaining to the purve yor's potential liability (criminal): Section RCW 70.54.02 0 Furnishing Impure Water - Penalty "Every owner, agent, manager, operator or ot her person having charge of any waterworks furnishing water for public use, who shall k nowingly permit any act or omit any duty or precaution by reason whereof th e purity of healthfulness of th e water supplied shall become impaired, shall be guilty of a gross mi sdemeanor." [1909 c 249 {291;RRS} 2543] Other statutes pertain to the pur veyor’s liability for payment of pe nalties for violation of laws or rules regulating public water systems. Unde r Section RCW 70.119A.0 30, DOH has statutory authority to impose penalties for violations of laws or rules (regulating publ ic water systems) that are determined to be a public health emergency. Under this RCW, purveyo rs may be penalized up to $10,000 per day per violation. In addition to the public health emergency pe nalty provision, Section RCW 70.119.040 grants DOH general authority to impose penalties for violation of laws or rules re gulating public water systems. Purveyors may be penalized up to $5,000 per day per violat ion. Purveyors shou ld note that when monetary damages are computed, every violation is co nsidered a separate offense, and in the case of continuing violations, every day’s continuance is a separa te and distinct violation. To reduce the exposure to lia bility, the purveyor should implement a CCC program that: Complies with regulatory requirements set fo rth in the drinking wa ter regulations (WAC 246-290-490); Follows the "standards " of the water industry for the app lication of backflow assemblies; Includes the installation of approved backflow preven tion assemblies; Includes the installation of backflow assemblies and devices in accordan ce with industry standards;

--- Page 47 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 5 Includes the testing of back flow assemblies by a method and at a frequency stipulated in regulations and recommended by industry standards; Includes the testing of backflow assemblies by certified testers (the certification establishes a minimum level of training of the personnel testing assemblies); and Includes procedures for inve stigating backflow incidents and restoring water quality after an incident occurs. Recognizing that contamination will occur, the pu rveyor’s exposure to liability can be reduced by transferring as much responsibilit y, and hence, the liab ility, to others. Th is may be done by: • Requiring isolation of the customer's prem ises by an approved backflow assembly commensurate with the degree of hazard, since the greates t exposure to liability for the purveyor is in the transm ission of a contaminant to its customers; and • Entering into a service contr act (written agreement) with th e customer to provide water service (the agreement spells out the obligations of the purveyor and customer). A written "service contract" provides the purveyor with the best form of enforcement authority, because the customer agrees to the standards imposed by the purveyor, and any enforcement action by the purveyor may be based on the customer's breach of contract. In the absence of specific contract terms to limit liability, all parties invo lved in cross-connection control will have some degree of implied responsibility. Each party is assumed to exercise "reasonable" conduct to prevent contamination of th e drinking water. If a case involving damages from contamination came before the courts, assessing liability may be reduced to a question of whether the defendant: Knew (or ought to have known) about the dangerou s condition; and Took reasonable steps within his/her control to prevent contamination of the water system. All purveyors have a contract with their custom ers. Contracts can be in writing (service agreements) or implied (nothing in writing). In either case, the purveyor agrees to provide safe, reliable drinking water, and the cust omer agrees to pa y for the water.

--- Page 48 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 5 As stated previously, the purveyor's jurisdicti on ends at the meter. Thus, the purveyor does not have a right to enter upon the customer's property , require a customer to inst all, test, or maintain a BPA, etc., except through the te rms and conditions established by the purveyor for providing water services, i.e., in the service agreement. If the agre ement is not in writing an d/or is not signed by the customer, the purveyor and cust omer may disagree on the obligations of each party. WAC 246-290-490 establishes the obligation of the purveyor to protect the public water system from contamination via cross conn ections. However the WAC does not directly or by implication, establish an obligation of the purveyor's customer to protect the public water system. For example, where mandatory premises isolation is require d under Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490, the purveyor is obligated to have an assembly installed on the service. The WAC does not address who must install the assembly. Thus, if the customer refuses to inst all the assembly, th e purveyor must install the assembly an d may have to bear the cost as sociated with the installation. Examples of standard written service contracts for new and existing cust omers are provided in Appendix D. The purveyor's attorn ey should be involved in estab lishing all forms of contracts. It is less expensive for purveyors to pay attorney fees for advice on how to avoid a lawsuit than to pay fees to defend in a lawsuit. The purveyor’s attorney should develop or approve all customer service agreements used by the purveyor.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 Chapter 6. Starting a Program 1 Overview Since 1970, the drinking water regulations in Washi ngton have included the requirement for purveyors to develop a CCC progra m. Yet, a 1994 DOH survey of water systems indicated that a majority of small water systems had not started a program. More rece nt data for 2001 indicates that even some of the largest community systems in Washington: • Had no written CCC program plans; • Had written programs that di d not contain all of the mini mum elements required in WAC 246-290-490(3); and/or • Were not implementing their programs. It should be noted that the minimum elements currently liste d in the CCC regulations first became effective in April 1999. However, the basic elements of a cross-co nnection program, as outlined in water industry reference manu als (e.g., Pacific Northwest S ection – American Water Works Association Cross-Connection Control Manual ), have not changed significantly since the early 1970s. Currently, four basic types of programs can be found in Wash ington. These are: Combination Programs These are CCC programs in wh ich the purveyor relies upon both premises isolation assemblies and in-premises assemblies to protect the distribution system. The purveyor requires premises isolation for premises of the type on the DOH mandatory list (Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490) and may ch oose to supplement Table 9 of WAC 246- 290-490 by adding other selected customer categories. For non-high hazard premises, the purveyor relies upon backflow protection at se lected points of use (high hazard fixtures) within the customer’s premises . With this type of program , the purveyor makes the risk assessment. Combination programs are the pr edominant type of program implemented by large community water sy stems in Washington. Premises Isolation Programs These are CCC programs in which the purveyo r relies solely upon pr emises isolation. All assemblies protecting the distribution sy stem are located at the meter (or at an alternate location acceptable to the purveyo r) to isolate the customer’s entire water (plumbing) system from the purveyor’s distribution system.

--- Page 51 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 For example, in this type of program , in addition to Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 premises, all residential customers with special plumbing and all commercial customers are “isolated” at the meter with a DCVA or RPBA. Joint Purveyor and Local Administrative Authority Programs These are programs that rely upon premises is olation for high-hazard premises (Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 list) and in-premises assemblies and de vices at selected points of use for other types of premises. The risk assessment is made through a join t program between the purveyor and Local Administrative Authority (local building/plumbing official). This type of program is most ofte n selected by municipal systems. Non-Community System Programs In these types of programs, protection from cr oss connections is affo rded by compliance with both the Uniform Plumbing Code and WAC 246-290 . This type of program is applicable where the purveyor owns the potable water system from the source of supply to the last tap. An example would be an elementary school supplied by its own well, storage tanks, treatment system, etc. Each type of cross-connec tion program identified above has signifi cantly different costs, risks, and liability implications to th e purveyor. The selectio n of the type of CCC pr ogram to implement is a major policy decision for the purveyor. Senior management, in consu ltation with th e purveyor’s attorney, should make the policy decision regarding program type. 2 Program Decisions The following list identifi es the fundamental policy decisions th e purveyor needs to make regarding the development and implementati on of a CCC program. Once made , the policies may be changed in the future. However, some policy changes are mo re difficult to make than others, once a program has been initially implemented. The major policy decisions are: Program Type (e.g., premises isolation only); Extent of Coordination (with Local Administrative Authority); Corrective Action; Service Agreements;

--- Page 52 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 Location & Ownership of Pr emises Isolation Assemblies; Cross-Connection Specialist Options; Testing of Assembly Options; and Cost Recovery. Each of these decisions will be di scussed in detail belo w. At the end of eac h section, a table is provided for the purveyor to re cord the policy decision made. 2.1 Types of Programs A CCC program may be based upon either: • Premises isolation pr otection only; or • A combination of premises isolat ion and in-premises protection. Premises isolation means a method of protec ting a public water system (i.e., the purveyor's system) by installation of DOH-approved AGs or backflow prevention assembli es installed at or near the service connection (or alternate lo cation acceptable to th e purveyor) to isolate the customer's water system from the purveyor's distribution system. For high hazard premises, premises isolation is accomplished by installation of an approved AG or DOH-appro ved RPBA on the service. For all CCC program types, manda tory premises isolation is required for high health hazard premises (hospitals, medical clinics, etc.). Table 9 of WAC 246-29 0-490 lists a number of categories of premises wher e an AG or RPBA is requi red for premises isolation. It should be noted that the high-hazard premises table in the WAC is not all-inclusive, and other types of premises considered to pose a high health hazard also require mandatory isolation with an AG or RPBA. Examples of other high hazard premises would include: airlin e manufacturing plants, paper mills, and military bases. Table 2 is a copy of the hi gh-hazard premises list from the WAC. If the customer's property use corr esponds to the risk assessment for the category (e.g., medical clinic), premises isola tion is mandatory. The only excep tion is where a customer's business practices and activities don’t matc h the category, i.e., the business name or description is misleading. For example, a “medical clinic” may only include psychologists. The health hazard posed by an office of psychologists is not the sa me as a typical medical clinic with physicians, laboratories doing blood work , cultures, providing diagnostic services such as x-rays, etc. In cases where the customer’s business pract ices aren’t consistent with the hazards normally associated with that category of business, the purveyor may grant an exception to mandatory premises isolation.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 Under WAC 246-290-49 0, the purveyor has an ob ligation to protect the pu blic water system from contamination. The purveyor's customers and the Local Administrative Authority (plumbing inspector/ health inspect or) have the obligation to prevent contamination of the potable water system within the property lines of the customer’s premises. When establishing a cross-connection contro l program, the purveyor must first determine what level of overall risk and potential liab ility is acceptable. Whenever the purveyor relies on in-premises backflow preventers, the purveyor accepts in creased risk and liab ility over premises isolation due to: • The potential for the plum bing system to be ch anged by the customer without the purveyor’s knowledge and/or approval of the Local Administrativ e Authority; and • The potential for the customer to fail to test, mainta in, and repair the ba ckflow preventers the purveyor relies on to protec t the public water system. Purveyors should consider all customers served by th e public water system to pose a health risk for contamination of the water distribu tion system. The health risk incr eases with the co mplexity of the customer's plumbing system, uses of water (i.e., on-site activities, processes), etc. No plumbing system should be considered free of cross connections. Howe ver, for many plumbing systems (e.g., residential homes) , with the normal cross-connect ion protection afforded through compliance with the Uniform Plumbing Code, th e risk of contamination to the purveyor’s distribution system is typically relatively low. Premises Isolation Programs For a premises isolation program , an assessment must be made of the degree of hazard posed by the customer to the public water system. Based on this asse ssment, if the degree of hazard is such that the purveyor believes premises isolation is needed, an approved backfl ow prevention assembly commensurate with the degree of hazard must be instal led on the service connection. A periodic re-evaluation of customers must be c onducted to confirm that the premises isolation decision initially made is still valid. If not, the appropriate backflow assemb ly must be installed on the service. This could be an installation where no assembly was previously required or an upgrade to an RPBA from a previously required DCVA (for a change in the customer's water use). The minimum premises isolatio n program would consist of: Identifying all custom ers of the high health hazard type su ch as those categories listed in Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490; and Ensuring the inst allation of the requ ired RPBA or AG.

--- Page 55 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 The minimum premises isolation program offers th e purveyor the minimum le vel of public health protection and liab ility management. For this reason, a premises isolation program normally includes an expanded list of categori es requiring premises isolation. An expanded list of premises isolation categories may be based upon a cust omer category system of classification for assessing health risk. For ex ample, a DCVA may be required as the minimum premises isolation for all shoppi ng malls. The purveyor's risk assessment then reduces to determining if there are any categories of tenants (e.g ., dental or medical clin ic) in the shopping mall that require the premises isolatio n requirement to be increased to an RPBA (e.g., the mall could include a medical clinic). When considering addition s to Table 9 of WAC 246- 290-490, purveyors need to be aware that the expanded list does not need to be limited to shop ping malls. It could also include all commercial customers. Purveyors could define commercial customers as all cu stomers other than single family and duplex residential customers. Under this appr oach, all tall buildings, apartments, etc., would be included in a general risk category requiring at least a DCVA for prem ises isolation. Combination Programs (Reliance on Premises Isolation and In-Premises Assemblies) In a combination program, the purveyor may rely on in-premi ses backflow assemblies (at the plumbing fixture) for all non high-hazard connec tions (i.e., where prem ises isolation is not mandated). The need to assess the degree of hazar d posed by the custom er on the distribution system does not change. However, the purveyor must determin e what individual plumbing hazards (fixtures) must be isolated with approved backflow assemblies to provide protection (equivalent to premises isolation) for the distribution system. Part of the in-premises risk assessment should in clude the potential for plumbing to be changed without the purveyor's knowledge. For example, strip malls with fr equent changes in tenants pose an increased risk to the public water system. For example, a cl othing retail store could be replaced by a camera store with a photo la b without the purveyor's knowledge. This would increase the risk to the purveyor's system. The purveyor would need to conduct re latively frequent re-surveys of the mall to ensure that new cross co nnections are detected, or add the mall to the supplemental list of customers requiring premises isolation. Part of the overall hazard assessme nt should also include an assess ment of the complexity of the building’s plumbing. As the complexity of the piping increase s, the risk of not identifying a cross connection increases.

--- Page 56 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 Tall buildings or buildings built on a hill above the street (water main elevation) also increase the risk of backflow into the purve yor's system from backpressure. For example, a small drop in the purveyor's system pressure may allow backflow to occur. For these re asons, WAC 246-290-490 gives purveyors the authority to require premises isolation on premises th at have characteristics such as: Complex plumbing arrangements or plumbing potentially subj ect to frequent changes that make it impractical to assess whet her cross-connectio n hazards exist; A repeat history of cros s connections being established or reestablished; or Cross-connection hazards that are unavoidable or not correctable , such as, but not limited to tall buildings. It should be noted that the in-p remises protection provided by the customer in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code may not be commensurate with the purveyor's asse ssed degree of hazard. This is often the case with old buildings. Once the customer complies with the Uniform Plumbing Code in effect at the time of construction, th e customer is “vested.” The Local Administrative Authority can’t require changes/up grades (e.g., ad dition of an RPBA) to the existing plumbing system, unless the building is sign ificantly remodeled. Thus, the Uniform Plumbing Code basically “grandfathers” the plumbing system s of existing buildings , and their owners ar e essentially exempt from requirements imposed by later versions of th e Uniform Plumbing Code. The purveyor can’t require the cu stomer to make plumbing chan ges, since enforcement of the Uniform Plumbing Code falls under the jurisdic tion of the Local Administrative Authority. However, the purveyor may offer the customer the option to volunt arily make a plumbing change (e.g., install a b ackflow assembly at a fixture) in lieu of installi ng a larger, more expensive backflow assembly on the servic e. The advantages to the customer are: • Possibly lower cost of installation (two 3/4-in ch assemblies within a building may cost less than a one 1-inch asse mbly located outside the premises in a vault or above ground enclosure); and • Greater health protection for the occupants of th e building, since the a ssembly on the service only protects the neighboring customers served by the public water system and not the occupants of the building. The disadvantage to the cu stomer is that the cost of testin g and maintaining multiple in-premises assemblies may be greater than th e cost associated with the singl e-premises isolation assembly. Thus, the customer's long-term testing and maintenance costs for the in-premises backflow assemblies may outweigh the initia l savings in purcha se price and inst allation costs.

--- Page 57 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 WAC 246-290-490 requires th e purveyor to protect the distribution system from contamination via cross connections. If the customer doesn’t agree to install a premises isolation assembly or equivalent in -premises protection at the fixture, the purveyor must install a premises isolation assembly on the cu stomer’s service. The above sections have discussed two major type s of cross-connection programs that purveyors can implement to comply with WAC 246-290-490. Table 3 (below) summari zes the major advantages and disadvantages of a premises isolation program vs. a combination program. Table 3 Type of Program Options Type of Program Premises Isolation Only Combination Program Major Advantages Lowers the purveyor’s costs and workload by reducing the number of assemblies to be monitored and the time spent on re-surveys. Reduces customer’s costs by eliminating an additional, possibly large, assembly on the service. Major Disadvantages Increases customer’s risk. Increases pressure loss in customer’s system. Increases customer’s cost. Increases the purveyor’s risk, due to unreported plumbing changes and undetected/unprotected cross connections. Increases purveyor’s workload and cost for administration. Purveyors can use the following table to document the policy decision made regarding what type of CCC program to implement.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 2.2 Extent of Coordination WAC 246-290-490 requ ires purveyors to coordinate with the Local Administrative Authority on CCC matters. Similarly, the Un iform Plumbing Code (as amended for Washington) requires the Local Administrative Authority to coordinate with th e purveyor on CCC matter s. The level of coordination with the Local Admi nistrative Authority may vary. Coordination options include: • A simple exchange of information (minimum effort); • Interacting (cooperating) with the Local Administrative Authority; or • Operating a combined (joint) purv eyor/Local Authority program. Each of these will be discus sed in more detail below. Exchange of Information Program For an exchange of information level of coordination , the purveyor should: Notify the Local Administrativ e Authority (local building offi cial/plumbing inspector) of the purveyor's CCC program type (e.g., pr emises isolation) and policies; Request to be notified by the Local Administrative Auth ority of all permits for new premises and for permits for pl umbing changes to existing pr emises served by the public water system; and Notify the Local Administrativ e Authority of any enforcement action in which water service is discontinued and of any backflow incidents known by the purveyor to have contaminated the public water system or the customer’s plumbing system. Note: Purveyors that in itially select the information exchange option can always upgrade the level of coordination to an interaction type of coordination in the future. WAC 246-290-490 does not requir e purveyors to enter into written agreements with Local Administrative Authorities. However, written agreements are strongly recommended for purveyors who decide to implement joint programs.

--- Page 59 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 The level of coordination must be described in the pur veyor's written CCC program plan. A sample program plan is provided in Appendix A. Interaction Level of Coordination For an interaction level of coordination (cooperation) with the Local Administrati ve Authority, the purveyor may: • Conduct joint surveys/inspections of the customer's premises; and • Share assembly location and testing information. An interaction level of coordina tion is only feasible where the Local Administrative Authority’s: • Staff is knowledgeable about/has expertise in cross-connection control; and • Staff resources are adequate to participate. Combined/Joint Program Level of Coordination Purveyors that wish to implement a combined/joint program with the Local Administrative Authority should establish: • Which agency (purveyor vs. Lo cal Administrative Authority) w ill be in overall charge (take the lead) of the jo int CCC program; • With the Local Administrative Authority, a written ag reement that clear ly delineates the authority and responsibility of each agency with regards to cross-connection control; and • A list of the tasks to be performed by each agency (i .e., the purveyor and Local Administrative Authority). For example, the purveyor agrees to maintain the database of all assemblies (i.e., premis es isolation assemblies and fixture protection assemblies) and their test results, etc. The Local Administra tive Authority conducts all plan reviews. Combined (joint) programs work best in situations where both the purveyor and Local Administrative Author ity fall under the same governmental entity (i.e., city or town).

--- Page 60 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 In joint programs, it is comm on for purveyors to delegate responsibilities to the Local Administrative Authority. Simila rly, in joint programs, purveyor s often accept responsibilities from the Local Administrative Authority. In both cases, th ese responsibilities are of ten not within the jurisdiction of the purveyor or the Local Administrative Authority respectively. Special care should be taken to consider th e purveyor’s potential liability when the written agreement is drafted. Table 4 shows the recomm ended extent of coordination based on system size and/or situation. Table 4 Coordination with Local Admi nistrative Authority Options Extent of Coordination – Recommended Application Information Exchange Interactio n Combined (Joint) Programs Most suitable for small water systems. Practical only where Local Administrative Authority has resources. Normally recommended where both the Purveyor and Local Administrative Authority fall under the jurisdiction of the same governmental entity (i.e., city or town). Written Agreements Although not requir ed in the WAC, purveyors wanting to implement joint programs are encouraged to develop written agreemen ts with their Local Admi nistrative Authorities. There are a number of topics that should be co nsidered when the water purveyor and Local Administrative Authority deve lop a written agreemen t to implement a jo int program. At a minimum, the written agreement should: Define the purpose of the joint program; Identify the partie s to the agreement; Define terms used in the ag reement (e.g., health hazard); Cite the regulations that th e combined program is based up on (e.g., WAC 246-290, UPC); Cite the authority (e .g., ordinance or council vote) to enter in to a written agreement and implement a combined program;

The requirements of a joint program must be consistent with the cross-connection control requirements of the individual purveyor and Local Administrative Authorities. The purveyor can use the following table to document the decision made regarding the extent of coordination with the Local Administrative Authority. Decision - Extent of Coordination (check one) Information Exchange Interaction Combined/Joint Program 2.3 Relationship to Customer Another major policy decision for the purveyor is how to formalize the business relationship between the purveyor and the customers. This ap plies to more than th e CCC program issues. Whether the purveyor is a private individual, a hom eowner’s association or a level of government (e.g., water district), good busine ss practices should be followed. Service agreements are one tool th at purveyors can use to formalize the business relationship with their customers. The purpose of a service agreement is to make clear to the customer the: • Legally binding conditions of service; and • Remedy afforded to the purveyor for th e customer's breach of contract.

--- Page 63 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 At a minimum, a service agreement should: Be in writing and signed by the customer or authorized agent of the customer; Be short, but explicit (in that the customer agrees to the service policy of the purveyor including the CCC requirements); Clearly state the corrective act ion the purveyor will take, when the custom er fails to comply with the agreement; and Include by attachment the purveyor 's written service po licy and standards. Every customer obtains wa ter service by agreement. The agreement may be verbal or written. Initially the agreement (contra ct) may be in the form of the customer requesti ng to purchase a water service connection, his payment of the connect ion fee, and the purveyor installing the service and meter. Thereafter, the ag reement may continue in the form of the customer's paym ent of the water bill. At the time of customer's appli cation for service, the purveyor had a policy (terms) for providing service. The terms may have be en limited to the customer's pa yment of a monthly bill. Any detailed policy (contract conditions) may not have b een communicated to th e customer. The policy may not have expressly covered cross connections. At the time of the applicat ion for service, or subseque ntly, the purveyor may: • Review the customer's plumbing plans and/or conduct a cross-connect ion survey to assess the hazard posed to the purveyor's system; • Request, as a result of the h azard assessment from the plan review and/or survey, the installation of premises isola tion or in-premises backflow as semblies to protect the water distribution system; or • Accept the protection afforded by existing backflow preventers. If the purveyor chose not to conduct a plan review and/or hazard su rvey, by default, the purveyor accepted the protectio n afforded by the existi ng backflow preventers (e.g., provided under the Uniform Plumbing Code). Historically, when requesting a cu stomer to install backflow pr eventer, purveyors commonly: • Notified the customer in writi ng of the results of a CCC pl an review and/or survey; • Specified the required backflow preventers; and

--- Page 64 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 • Notified the customer of the requirement for testing upon installation and thereafter annually, etc. This written request to comply with the purveyor's conditions for service was accepted by the customer through the act of instal ling the backflow preventers. The purveyor then relied upon the cu stomer's installation, testing, main tenance, and repair of the in- premises or premises isolation approved backfl ow preventers and other in-premises backflow devices to protect the public water system. This agreement between the pu rveyor and customer was reaffirmed each year with the re quest to the customer to have th e approved assemb lies tested by a DOH-certified BAT. The customer may not have been informed of the purveyor's service policy to: Discontinue water service, if the customer failed to comply wi th the requiremen t for testing, maintenance, etc., (unless the custom er is issued a second notice); Require the customer to install a backflow preventer for premises is olation on the service pipe; or Install a backflow preventer for premises is olation on the customer’s service line, if the customer failed to do so when requested by the purveyors. If the above scenario is curren tly applicable to the system, it is recommended that the purveyor request that existing customers sign a written se rvice agreement. If the purveyor chooses not to pursue this independently, the firs t opportunity to require the cust omer to sign a service agreement should be taken advantage of. The opportunity may arise with: Request for a new or additional connection; Change in ownership of premises; and/or Change of water use on the premises (e.g ., through building ex pansion, change from residential to commercial customer category, etc.). Unless the service agreement is r ecorded with the title to the property, the ne w owner of a building is normally not aware of the terms of the service agreement with the purveyor. The purveyor needs to reaffirm this information with the "new customer.”

--- Page 65 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 For existing customers without service agreements , the purveyor may in corporate the written service agreement into the notice to the customer to test assemblies or submit a hazard survey. The letter could include the following statements: • In the past, the purveyor requested the insta llation of one or more backflow assemblies within the customer's pr emises to protect the water distribution system; • By the customer's compliance with the purveyor’s request, the purveyor agreed not to require the installation of a back flow assembly on the service; • This benefits the customer by providing protection for both th e customer's plumbing system (and family) and the wa ter distribution system; • To continue with this arrangement, the custom er must have the assemblies tested by a DOH- certified BAT and maintained, repaired, or replaced as ne eded to assure performance; • By completing and returning the a ttached assembly test report form, the customer agrees to continue the agreement to provide in-premise s protection (rather than have the purveyor install an assembly on the customer’s wate r service and invoice the customer for the installation cost, annual maintenance cost); and • The customer may chose to install an assembly on his service pipe in lieu of the in-premises assemblies; however, such insta llation will not reli eve the customer of his responsibility to comply with the requirements of the Unifor m Plumbing Code enforced by the Local Administrative Authority. The letter and accompanyi ng assembly test form will likely document the initial agreement now forgotten by the customer , lost by the purveyor, etc. Sample written service agreements are included in Appendix D. All agreements should be prepared by or approved as to form by the purveyor's attorney. Table 5 summarizes the ma jor advantages and disadvantages of having written service agreements.

Purveyors can use the following table to docume nt whether their busine ss relationship with customers will be formalized th rough written service agreements. Decision - Relationship with Customers Written service agreement/cont ract signed by customer Ordinance/resolution; implied se rvice agreement with customer 2.4 Enforcement of Correcti ve Actions [Element 1] Per WAC 246-290-490 (3), when establishing authority to impl ement a CCC program, purveyors must describe the corrective actio n used to ensure th at consumers comply with the purveyor’s CCC requirements. For reliance on in -premises assemblies and/or premises isolation assemblies owned by the customer, the purveyor must make provisi ons for corrective action to be taken if the customer: Fails to test or maintain the assemblies; or Makes a change to the plumbing syst em that necessitates the installation of additional assemblies and/or different types of assemblies. Prior to April 1999, th e cross-connection regulations incl uded the following requirement: "When an existing cross connection poses a poten tial health or system hazard, the purveyor shall shut off water service to the premises, until the cross conn ection had been eliminated or controlled by the installa tion of a proper backflow prevention assembly."

--- Page 67 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 The current WAC (effective April, 1999) states: “The purveyor shall take appropriate corrective action within its authority if: A cross connection exists that is not cont rolled commensurate to the degree of hazard assessed by the purveyor; or A consumer fails to comply with th e purveyor's requirements regarding the installation, inspection, testing, maintenance, or repair of an approved backflow preventer required by this chapter.” The current WAC continue s with the following: “The purveyor's correctiv e action may include, bu t is not limited to: Denying or discontinuing water service to a consumer's premises until the cross- connection hazard is eliminated or contro lled to the satisfactio n of the purveyor; Requiring the consumer to install an appr oved backflow preventer for premises isolation commensurate with the degree of hazard; or The purveyor installing an approved backflow preventer fo r premises isolation commensurate with the degree of hazard." WAC 246-290-490 states that a purveyor denying or discontinuing water service to a customer's premises for "corrective action" shall notify the Local Administrative Authority ( not Washington State Department Of Health ) prior to taking action, ex cept in the event of an emergency. The failure of a customer to comp ly with purveyor's requirement fo r inspection, tes ting, etc., may constitute a potential health hazard, but not an actual health hazard. A backfl ow assembly that fails the annual test may continue to stop backflow. However, it may do so with less of a safety factor. The purveyor has the right to discontinue water service to a customer to protect the water distribution system. However, the unreasonable ex ercise of this right ma y expose the purveyor to liability. The shut off of a water service may cause: A significant financia l loss to the customer;

--- Page 68 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 Backsiphonage conditions that may result in a backflow inci dent within the customer's premises; and A public health hazard to employees and/or residents of the premises (e.g., apartment building) from a backflow incident; the lack of water supply for domestic use, fire sprinkler systems, kidney dialysis , etc; and the lack of operating sanitary facilities (e.g., toilets). As a corrective action, if the purve yor shuts off water service to a customer, based on an assessment of health risk, the purveyor has th e burden of proof that the actio ns were reasonable. There are certain situations, i.e., public health emergenc ies, where the shut-off of water to a specific connection is needed to protect the public water system from contamination. Examples would include unprotected cross connections to sewage and when a backflow incident is occurring or has just occurred. For situations other than the public health em ergencies cited above, rather than face the burden of proof, the purveyor may wish to take an alternate corre ctive action, i.e., installing a backflow assembly on the service . Alternatively, the purveyor may wish to establish with the customer service agreements (contracts) that pr ovide a legal protection for corrective action. The purveyor's servic e policy should include provisions for recovering all of the purveyor's costs associated with the corrective action. Table 6 summarizes the advantag es and disadvantages of the tw o main corrective action options available to purveyors. Many purveyors include bot h types of corrective actions in their programs, but limit the use of water shut-o ff to emergency type situations.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 Table 6 Primary Enforcement Options Type of Cor rective Action Shut Off Water Service Install Premises Isolation Assembly* Major Advantages Provides the most immediate protection of purveyor’s system. Purveyor ensures protection of system. Least exposure to legal liability. Avoids public health issues relating to lack of water supply. Major Disadvantages Increased exposure to liability for damages from shut-off of water. Additional cost of premises isolation assembly. Purveyor must bear cost or collect from customer, or must rely on customer–owned assembly for premises isolation. * Purveyors choosing this type of corrective action have the option to install and own the premises isolation assembly themselves, or to have the customer install and own the assembly. Purveyors may use the following ta ble to document their decisions regarding enforcement of their CCC programs. As discussed above, purveyors can in clude both types of corrective actions in their written program plans and identify the one that will be the most commonly used means of enforcing the program (i.e., purveyor in stalled backflow preventer). Decision - Enforcement Action Rely upon shut-off of water Rely upon purveyor-installed premis es isolation backflow preventers 2.5 Initial Assessment and Periodic Re-Assessment of Hazard [Element 2] WAC 246-290-490 requires the purv eyor to ensure that a CCS: • Assesses the degree of hazard po sed by the consumer’s water system upon the purveyor’s distribution system; and • Determines the appropriate meth od of backflow protection.

--- Page 70 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 Thus, after the basic foundation of the program has been accomplished, the implementation of an on-going CCC program starts with the assessme nt of the level of hazard posed by various connections served by the system . More than any other aspect of a CCC program, the training, expertise and experience of a DOH-c ertified CCS is called upon to properly accomplis h this task. The initial assessment of a service connection or premises refers to either the: Assessment conducted prior to service being initiated for a new service connection; or First time an assessment is performed for an existing service connection. After the initial assessment, the CCC regulations require periodic re-assessment of the service connection to evaluate the appropriateness of th e existing level of cros s-connection protection. To comply with these regulatory requirements, the following options are ava ilable to the purveyor: The purveyor's certified CCS (on staff or contractor) makes the initial assessment of degree of hazard and periodic re-evaluations; or Each customer is required to hire a privat e CCS (contractor) to co nduct the hazard survey and submit a report to the purveyor. Option 2 offers the major advantag e to the purveyor of tr ansferring the cost of the initial evaluation and re-evaluation of commercial customers (and other customers with complex plumbing) from the purveyor to the customer. With Option 2, the purveyor's certified CCS shou ld review the hazard ev aluation report submitted by the customer's CCS. The purveyor's CCS review may be done as part of the periodic program review (e.g., once per year), provided the system ’s CCC Program Manager is given general review guidelines on reviewing reports from customers. Table 7 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the two hazard assessment options.

Regardless of the type of program implemented (premises isolation vs. a combinatio n program), the purveyor must decide on the issues of ownership and installation location for all premises isolation backflow preventers. The general options available to the purveyor are premises isolation backflow preventer owned by the: Purveyor and installed with the meter on th e public right-of-way (R OW) or in a utility easement along side the public ROW; or

Immediately downstream of the meter; or b. Downstream of the meter, before the se rvice line enters the building or in the mechanical room where the service line ju st enters the buildin g, with no connections between the meter and the backflow preventer. Illustrations 4-6 show three ownership/location co mbinations for premises isolation assemblies. Premises isolation is define d as ... "the installation of approved AGs or approved backflow prevention assemblies at or near the service connection ( or alternate location acceptable to the purveyor) to isolate the consumer's water system from the purveyor's distribution system.”

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 Illustration 6 Customer-Owned Premises Isolation Assembly Installed at an "Alternate Location" Acceptable to Purveyor* * No connections between the meter and premises isolation assembly, unless the connection is specifically approved by the purveyor. Purveyors face an increased risk when they accept a customer-installed premises isolation assembly at a location other than immediately do wnstream of the purveyor's meter (i.e., at the property line). The risk comes from the potential for connections to be made to the customer's service pipe without the purveyor's knowledge. A common "alternate locati on" is the mechanical room of a building where the BPA is protected from freezing. This may offer a major cost savings for the customer over construc tion of an insulated, heated enclosure for a BPA immediately downstream of the meter. However, with this arrangement, the customer receives the benefit, while the purveyor accepts the increased risk. The major advantage to the purveyor's ownership of premises isolation assemb lies is the increase in the reliability of the assemblies that protect the public water system. The increased re liability results from the fact that the purveyor pur chases, installs, tests, maintains, and repairs the assemblies. The major advantage to the pur veyor of the customer ow ning the assembly is av oiding the responsibility (and cost) for purchase, installation, maintenance, repairs, or replacemen t and the accompanying potential liability for assembly fail ure.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 2.7 Cross-Connection Specialist Options [Element 4] WAC 246-290-490 (3) requires pers onnel, including at least one person certified as a cross- connection specialist (CCS) to be provided to develop and implement the CCC program. The options available to comply wi th the CCS requirement are: Purveyor's staff member obtains CCS certification; Purveyor contracts with another water utilit y or agency (e .g., the Local Administrative Authority, satellite management agency, etc.) to use the services of their CCS; or Purveyor contracts with an in dependent CCS to provide services. RCW 70.119 governs DOH’s certif ication of CCSs and BATs. Th e involvement of a CCS to "develop and implement" a program varies with the type of program. For example, in a premises isolation program that follows a policy of re quiring backflow assemb lies only for customers included in Table 9 of WAC 246- 290-490 (mandatory list), the ne ed for the services of a CCS would be minimal. Table 9 of this manual summarizes the advant ages and disadv antages of the three CCS options availa ble to the purveyor. Table 9 Cross-Connection Control Sp ecialist (CCS) Options to Implement Purveyor's Program Purveyor’s Program – CCS Options Purveyor’s Staff Member Certified Contract with Another Utility or Agency Contract with Consultant CCS Major Advantages CCS is readily available.

Thus, re gardless of the type of program implemented (premises isolation vs. a combination program), the purveyor must establish a policy for the testing of assemblies relied upon by the purveyor to protect the distribution system. The general options are: Purveyor's backflow a ssembly tester (BAT), on staff or a contractor, tests al l assemblies; or Purveyor requires the customer to hire a BAT. The purveyor shall ensure that a DOH-certified BAT tests approved backflow prevention assemblies (relied upon by the purveyor) for proper operation. [WAC 246-290-490 (7)] Having the purveyor's BAT (staff or contract or) perform the tests has the advantage of: Increased reliability (quality control over testing) and th us, decreased pot ential liability (backflow incident); Less administrative cost for the purveyor (notificat ion letters, quality a ssurance, etc.); and Good public relations, because the customer is not responsible for the task.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 Testing by the purveyor's staff or contractor BAT has the disadvantages of the purveyor incurring: Possible liability for an assembly failure; and Increased costs for staff. In programs where the pur veyor requires the customer to hire a BAT, the purvey or should provide the customer with a list of loca l contractor BATs (see Section 7 for details) that have met the purveyor’s criteria to test. Alth ough not currently ava ilable, a public listi ng of certified BATs should be available fr om DOH in the future. Table 10 summarizes the advant ages and disadvantages of the two BAT options available to purveyors.

The cost of the program should be identified in th e purveyor's operating budget. To reduce and/or recover the cost of the CCC program, the purveyor may: Assess the general administrative cost of th e cross-connection program to all customers, or to one class of customers (e.g., all commercial cu stomers) through use of: a. Commodity or consumption charges (e.g., $/gallon); b. Meter charges (e.g., $/month), based on the size of meter; or c. A supplemental backflow assembly charge (e.g., $/month), ba sed on the size of assembly. Require each customer to dir ectly bear the costs of the haza rd surveys and costs associated with the purchase, installation, testing, and maintenance of any backflow assemblies by requiring each customer: a. With a commercial account, to hire a CCS to conduct the initial and subsequent surveys to assess the health hazard; b. To purchase, install, main tain, repair, and/or replace any backflow assemblies required as a result of th e hazard survey; and c. With backflow assemblies to hire a BAT for assembly testing.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 3 Programs for Non-Community Systems Per Chapter 246-290 WAC, there are two types of Group A non-community water systems. These are: Non-transient non-community systems; and Transient non-community systems. The WAC defines these type s of systems as follows: A non-transient non-comm unity system (NTNC) is a public water system that provides service opportunity to 25 or more of the same nonresidential people for one hundred eighty or more days within a calendar year (e.g., school, motel with more than 25 employees on site); and A transient non-community system (TNC) is a public water system that serves: a. 25 or more different people each day for si xty or more days within a calendar year; b. 25 or more of the same people each day fo r sixty or more days, but less than one hundred eighty days, within a calendar year; or c. One thousand or more people for two or more consecutive days within a calendar year (e.g., county fair). A common characteristic of many no n-community systems is that th ey occupy a single parcel of land under one ownership. As such, the public wa ter system includes all facilities from the source of supply to the tap. For non-community systems, the jurisdictions of DOH and the Local Administrative Authority overlap. Thus, the owner of a non- community system must comply with the requirements of both jurisdictions. In other words, non-community sy stems must comply with both the drinking water regulations (Chapter 246-290 WAC) and the Unif orm Plumbing Code. Wher e there is a conflict between requirements, the system owner must comply with the more stringent of the two requirements, or comply with both requirements. Non-community system purveyors that are develo ping CCC programs should apply the drinking water system regulations to t hose facilities that are normally operated by a community water system. In other words, the drin king water regulations should be applied to the infrastructure from the source of supply to the servic e connection to the build ing(s). The primary focus of the drinking water regulations is that the sour ce of supply and the distribution facilities (t ransmission mains) are not contaminated via unprot ected cross connections.

--- Page 84 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 6 Similarly, the Uniform Plumbing C ode should be applied to the fixtures within the building(s) and any irrigation systems on the premises. The prim ary focus of the Uniform Plumbing Code is to ensure that the plumbing system (within the buildi ng or buildings) doesn’t become contaminated via unprotected cross connections. Depending on the number and type of buildings served, the CCC pol icy of a non-community system may be to provide: Source protection, if a single building or wate r user is supplied (e.g., provide a DCVA at the well house that supplies a restaurant); Area or building isolation (particularly if a Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 premises is served); and/or Equivalent in-building protection through inst allation of backflow preventers at hazardous fixtures per the Uniform Plumbing Code. An example of a written program plan for a non-community system is provided in Appendix B.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Chapter 7. Implementing a C ross-Connection Control Program 1 General Administration The general administration tasks for a CCC program are the same for both sm all and larger public water systems. The primary diff erence is in the amount of admini strative work associated with implementation of the program. For small water sy stems with primarily residential customers, the administration of a CCC program should only result in a small, added workload to the system’s existing workload. Fo r these systems, someone other than a DOH-certified CCS may carry out many of the administrative tasks asso ciated with the CC C program. . 1.1 Overall Management WAC 246-290-490(3)(e) states that "personnel, including at least one person certified as a cross- connection specialist (CCS)..." shall be provided to develop and implement the CCC program. The WAC also states in 246-290- 490(2)(c) that the purveyor may implement the CCC program directly or by means of a contract with another agency or party acceptable to DOH. This language was specifically included to give sm all water systems that serve primarily residential customers the option to contract out for the serv ices of a CCS. Options for empl oying the CCS were discussed in Section 6.2.6. The purveyor should designate one individual, i.e., the CCC Program Manager, to provide the overall management of the CCC program. The purveyor should de legate to the Program Manager the authority and responsibility to orga nize and implement the CCC program. For larger systems, the CCC Program Manager is typically the DOH-certified CCS in responsible charge of the CCC program. Small water system CCC Program Ma nagers must ha ve a general knowledge of cross-connection control, but they do not necessarily need to be certified as CCSs. For small systems, administration of the CCC program typically requires only limited, periodic work for the CCS . Thus, the services of a full-time CCS are not likely to be needed by a small water syst em (nor is full- time involvement always practical). Small water system CCC Program Ma nagers that are not currently certified CCSs should complete some CCC training. This will he lp them to become more knowle dgeable about the public health aspects of cross-connection contro l, the regulatory requirements for public water systems and basic industry practices. This knowledge should help uncertified Pr ogram Managers with the day-to-day implementation of the CCC program. Several third party training organizations offer CCC courses in Washington. These courses range from inexpensive one-day Basi c CCC classes for Small Water Sy stems to more expensive, weeklong CCS certification classes. More information is available on training in Appendix F.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Small system CCC Program Managers interested in pursu ing CCS certificatio n should note that scholarships might be available. The CCC Committee of the PN WS-AWWA offers CCS scholarships for syst ems serving 2500 connections or less. See Appendix F for further information. For a small water system, th e CCC Program Manager may be: • The owner of the system (private system); • An elected representative (water association or district); or • An employee, contract manager, or satellite mana gement agency. The Cross-Connection Control Program Manage r will be responsible for the day-to-day contact with customers, the ge neral public, state and local government, etc., on cross- connection control matters. To ensure that th is contact person is ke pt well informed, all CCC Program administration tasks should be un der their supervision. For example: • All correspondence should be routed throug h the Program Manager (the Program Manager should sign the correspondence or at least receive a copy); and • All plans, plan review reports, cross-connection hazard survey reports, as sembly test reports, etc., should be routed th rough the Program Manager. When technical CCC prog ram issues arise, sma ll water system CCC Prog ram Managers who are not certified CCSs should defer to the recommendations and advice of the contract CCS. Program Managers who have concerns about or don’t agre e with the contract CC S’s recommendations can contact DOH for regulatory interp retation questions and/or seek th e advice of another experienced CCS. Non-CCS Program Managers shou ld not over-ride th e recommendations of their contract CCSs. 1.2 Purveyor's Poli cy Statement/Ordinance Once developed, the CCC program po licy (policy statement, ordinance and/or resolution) should be incorporated into the purveyor 's system Management and Oper ations Manual. Purveyors can inform their customers about the CCC program policy by: • Distributing the policy to new customers with the application for water service (e.g., as an attachment to the service agreement); and • Including a policy summary statement in the annual Co nsumer Confidence Report.

--- Page 88 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 The annual Consumer Co nfidence Report can be a cost-effective tool for public education on the purveyor's conditions for service, including the customer's obligation to protect the distribution system from contamination through cross connections. 1.3 Personnel All water system employees (staff and/or contr act manager/operator) should have a general knowledge of cross-connection cont rol. The CCS involved in the development and implementation of the program will likely be the most knowledgeable about the principles and practices of cross- connection control. However, all other water sy stem staff members, from time-to-time, may be involved in CCC issues because: • Customers may ask general questions of office and/or field staff; • Office staff will process th e paper work relate d to the CCC program (survey records, correspondence, DOH annual su mmary report forms, etc.); • Field staff may encounter backflow condition s (e.g., main break causes backsiphonage conditions, meter reader may noti ce meter running backwards) or may need to respond to a backflow incident; and • Field staff may spot a new “uncontrolled” (i .e., no backflow preventer) cross connection (e.g., customer may have installed a lawn spri nkler system without noti fying the purveyor or obtaining a plumbing permit from the Local Administrative Authority). General CCC training fo r staff may be ob tained through: Workshops sponsored and/or provided by DOH or technical associations, such as the Pacific Northwest Section - American Water Wo rks Association (PNW S-AWWA), Spokane Region Cross-Connection Control Committee (SRC4), the Western Washington Cross- Connection Prevention Professionals Group (The Group), and the American Backflow Prevention Associ ation (ABPA); and Operator training manuals, such as Small Water System Operation and Maintenance , prepared by California Stat e University, Sacramento.

--- Page 89 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 For the CCS employed by the purveyor (on sta ff or by contract), sp ecialized training is recommended and current CCS certification is required . The initial specializ ed training may be a three to five day "specialist" course. The CCS must hold a cu rrent Cross-Connection Specialist certification issued by DOH. To be eligible to sit for the CCS exam, an applicant must have a high school diploma and have six months experience (not necessarily in cross-connection control) working for a public water system . The Cross-Connection Control Resource Information section in Appendix F provides information about training resources and CCS certification courses. DOH requires contract operators to be certified CCSs and Water Distribution Managers. To obtain a list of contract operators check the DOH Office of Drinking Water website at: http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/dw Completion of a three to five-d ay CCS course and certification by DOH ensures a minimum level of knowledge in cross-connec tion control. However, CCS certific ation does not provide any assurance of experience or expertise. When employing a CCS to develo p and/or implement the cross- connection control program (eit her on staff, inter-agency agreement, or contract CCS), purveyors should follow procedures normally used for selecting a contra ctor or consultant. Purveyors should try to get proposals from at least two (preferably three) contract CCSs . When soliciting proposals from contract CCSs, at a minimum, purv eyors should request: • Documentation of current CCS certification, and the date of initi al CCS certification; • A resume of applicable training, certification, and work experience w ith specific emphasis on experience in program development and im plementation to meet the most recently published CCC regulations; • A list of public water systems the CCS is currently under contra ct with and/or systems they have provided CCC progra m services to within the past five years and a description of the services provided to each system; • The names of at least three public water systems the CCS has worked for within the previous three to five years (to contact as references); • Information on the scope of serv ices the CCS is willin g to provide (the scope should include all tasks specified in WAC 246-290-490); and • A sample of the CCS’s written work, i.e., a sample CCC program plan, Annual Summary Report (ASR), other report, etc. (to evaluate the quality of their work).

--- Page 90 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Purveyors should ca refully check references to obtain in formation about the quality of service provided by the contract cross- connection control specialist. When checking references purveyors should be sure to ask whether any problems were encountered during the contract and whether the system would hire the CCS again. Purveyors should avoid cross-connection control specialists who advocate an in -premises protection only strate gy, since this approach doesn’t provide adequate public health protection and do esn’t comply with the current cross-connection control regulations. It is recommended that pu rveyors only hire CCSs who: • Are familiar with the intent of the most recently published CC C regulations and any revisions being prop osed and who work closely w ith DOH CCC program staff; • Develop complete written program plans (i.e., that comply with all the minimum elements in the regulations); • Return purveyor technical assi stance phone calls wi thin a reasonable timeframe and during business hours; and • Ensure that original CCC records are kept by the water system. If the feedback from references is positive, purveyors may wi sh to request a samp le contract from the CCS. The contract sh ould clearly identify the specific task s to be performed by the CCS, the timeframe for completion of each task and include a provision fo r the water system to seek a remedy for any work that is unsatisfactory to the purveyor (at no additional cost). The contract should also specify that the written program plan will comply with the requirements of the most recently published CCC regulations . In addition, the contract should specify that all work performed by the CCS w ill be in accordance with the most recently publ ished CCC regulations. Small systems contracting out the development of a written program are advised to include language in the contract that allows them to withhold final payment pending DOH’s review and acceptance of the written pr ogram. Final payment should not be made, un til DOH has indicated to the purveyor that the written CCC prog ram meets the current regulat ory requirements and is considered acceptable. Taking the above steps is analogous to an insura nce policy for a small sy stem and should help prevent a small system from be ing taken advantage of by unscr upulous CCSs. DOH is aware of one small system in Washington that paid $15,000 to a contract CCS for development of a written CCC program plan and other services. Shortly afte r the system made the final payment, DOH sent out notices that the new regulations had been adop ted. The program developed for the small system didn’t begin to comply with the new regulations . The contract only specified that the program would meet the regulations cu rrently in effect, so the sy stem had no recourse.

--- Page 91 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 In this case, the CCS under c ontract never told the purveyor that the CCC regulations were undergoing extensive revision. Yet, DOH had not ified all CCSs in Washin gton of the upcoming changes and invited them to partic ipate in the regulation revisions process. The CCS also did not inform the purveyor that the ne w regulations specified the minimum elements of a written program. If, prior to making final payment, the small syst em purveyor had contacte d DOH and asked for an informal review of the program developed by the contract CCS, th is unfortunate situation might have been avoided. Small water systems might want to consider contracting wi th a cross-connection control specialist who also is a certified back flow assembly tester (i.e., BAT). Although not required, the additional certificatio n would be advantageous to the system, since the BAT could test all purveyor-owned assemblies. For most small systems, a cross-connection control specialist (CCS) is needed for a relatively small number of hours of work . Thus, the hourly fee should not be a major f actor in selecting a CCS. Instead, purveyors should select a CCS based upon training, experience, and past performance. WAC 246-290-490 specifies a number of program tasks that must be performed by a DOH-certified CCS. These tasks include: Development and implementation of the CCC program; Hazard assessments and determination of the appropriate backflow protection; Granting of exceptions to the mandatory prem ises isolation requirements and completion of forms to document the reason for granting th e exception; Inspection of backflow preven ter installations to en sure that backflow protection provided is commensurate with th e degree of hazard; Inspection of AG installations for compliance with the AG definition; and Inspection of backflow as semblies for correct instal lation and approval status.

--- Page 92 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Although not currently required, it is recommended that the purveyo r’s CCS also complete and sign the ASR forms. For sma ll water systems with a CCS under contract, if comp letion of the forms is not within the scope of work provided by the CCS, at a mini mum the CCS should: • Provide the CCC Program Manager with the in formation and inventor y data needed to complete the ASR forms; • Review the forms for accuracy; and • Sign them on behalf of the water system. Table 13 provides an example of the typical ta sks and division of re sponsibilities between the Program Manager and the CCS for a small water system.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 1.4 Water Service Agreements The types of water service agreemen ts and their respective benefits are discussed in Section 6.2.2. Whatever the form of service agre ement, the Program Manager and CCS should be involved in the: • Development of the water service agreement; and • Administration of the agreement (e.g., enforcement actions). For new customers , the Program Manager should ensure that the custom er signs an application for water service (i.e., the service agreement). For existing customers , two options are available. The Program Manager may either: Request that the customer sign an agreement; or Reaffirm the terms of service by asking the cu stomer to sign an agre ement as a condition of retaining his existing backfl ow prevention assemblies for fi xture protection in lieu of installing premises is olation assemblies. Appendix D includes copies of standard servi ce agreements for new an d existing customers. 1.5 Backflow Assembly Installation Standards Per WAC 246-290-490, a ll backflow prevention as semblies that protect th e public water system from contamination must be appr oved by DOH. In addition, the WA C requires these assemblies to be installed in a manner that will facilitate their proper operation, maintenance, inspection, and in- line testing. Assemblies must also be installed in compliance with safety regulations and all applicable building and plumbing code regulations. The purveyor is re sponsible for ensuring that backflow preventer installations comply with safety regulations, codes, etc., for the back flow preventers it owns. These requirements were established, because an improper installation decreases the assembly’s reliability of preventing backflow. This is due to the fact that: • An unsafe or inaccessible loca tion reduces the likelihood of an assembly being inspected, tested and maintained;

--- Page 95 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 • Improper assembly orientation may prevent proper operation; • Installation in a hazardous environment may allow contaminants to enter the assembly through test cocks, relief va lve ports, or air inlets, and/or may cause corrosion damage; and • Freezing temperatures or high temperatures may damage the assembly. Where the purveyor is also part of a Local Administrative Authority (tow n or city), any installation problem noted by the purveyor (i.e., water utility) is deemed to be known by th e plumbing inspector, whether or not there is communication between the two departments. Manufacturers provide recommendations for the prope r installation of their assemblies, and it is important to consult the manufact urer's instructions prior to th e installation of any assembly. However, the water purveyor or other approval authorities ma y have established installation requirements that differ from the manufacturer's recommendations. In fact, the manufacturer's recommendations may be in conflict with DOH and/or the purveyor's requirements. In all cases, the more stringent installation requirements of DOH and the water purveyor take precedence over the manufacturer ’s recommendations. The Washington State Department of Health Backflow Prevention Assemblie s Approved for Installation in Washington shows the appr oved orientation for the installation of each ap proved assembly (e .g., flow upward, horizontal, vertical, or alternate orientation) by make, model, and size of assembly. Systems that need to establish installation standards for their pr ogram plans can co nsult technical publications, regional CCC groups and/or larger purveyors in their area for detailed assembly installation information. Recommen ded installation standards are prov ided in technical publications such as the: • Manual of Cross-Connection Control , published by the University of Southern California - Foundation for Cro ss-Connection Control & Hydraulic Research (USC-FCCCHR); and

--- Page 96 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 • Cross-Connection Control Manual, Accepted Procedure and Practice , published by the Pacific Northwest Section, American Water Works Association. Most water utilities in Washingt on with established progra ms reference the PNWS-AWWA publication. Another source of installation in formation is the regi onal CCC groups within Washington. The Western Washington Group has developed brochures showing the installation requirements for each type of assembly used fo r premises isolation. The purveyor of a smal l water system may adopt installa tion standards by referencing: • The above noted manuals; • The standard plans issued by a nearby (large) utility; • The standard plans issued by a re gional CCC group in Washington; or • Standard plans issued by the purveyor. Examples of standard installation draw ings are included in Appendix D. 2 Implementation of Program Program implementation starts w ith the adoption of CCC policy (ord inance, by-law, or other legal instrument). This is fo llowed by development of a written program plan to carry out the policy and to meet the requirements of WAC 246-290-490. The written descri ption of the program must be included in the purveyor's Water System Plan or Small Water System Management Program, whichever is applicable. WAC 246-290-490 (3)(b) sets fort h the required elements of th e CCC program. The minimum elements are summarized in sect ion 4.3 of this manu al. The major implementation elements are discussed in this section. The purveyor reduces ex posure to liability by complying with the cr oss-connection control regulations for Group A sy stems and following the "standards" of the cross-connection control industry.

--- Page 97 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 2.1 Schedule of In itial Risk Assessment The purveyor must establish procedures and schedules for assessing the cross-connection hazard (health risk) of all new and existi ng customers. The procedure for hazard assessment depends on the type of pr ogram adopted, i.e., premises isolati on versus a combination program that also relies on in-premises assemblies. The disc ussion on program types was provided in Section 2.1. New Customers The hazard assessment for a ll new connections should have begun in April of 1999. This was the effective date of the new regula tions. According to the WAC, f or new customers, the hazard assessment must be done before service is provided . The assessment may be done by: • Category classification (medical clinic); • Customer questionnaire (fire sprinkler system); and/or • CCS plan review and field cr oss-connection hazard survey. Existing Customers For existing customers, the purveyor must prepare a sc hedule acceptable to DOH for: • The initial hazard assessment; and • Periodic re-assessment. An absolute deadline has not been establishe d by DOH for completion of the initial hazard assessment. The hazard assessment procedures for new and existing customers are essentially the same. However, the h azard assessment schedules for these two categories of customers will differ. The hazard assessment schedule for ex isting customers is a key elemen t in the purveyor's written program. The assessment schedules directly affect the an nual administration and operation costs of the purveyor’s CCC program. The schedules also have a major bearing on the pu rveyor's exposure to the risk of contamination an d potential liability for damage s from a backflow incident.

--- Page 98 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Hazard assessments should be done on a priority basis. A higher priority should be given to high health hazard categories of premises (e.g., hospitals, medical clinics, car washes, etc., of the type listed on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490). Setting Priorities All purveyors need to set prior ities for hazard assessmen ts, due to limited resources. However, purveyors with combination program s need to even be more careful in prio ritizing their hazard assessments. This is because a significantly greater effort is re quired to survey the non-high hazard customer’s premises to determ ine if backflow preventers at fixtures provide protection commensurate with the degree of hazard and equivalent to premises isolation. For combination programs that rely on premises is olation and in-premises pr otection, priority for hazard assessments should be as follows (lis ted from high to low priority): High Priority: Customers of the type listed on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 as a high health hazard requiring premises isolation by an AG or RPBA (mandatory premises isolation); Medium Priority: Customers included in the purveyor's supplemental list for mandatory premises isolation; and Low Priority: The remaining customers. Initial Hazard Assessment Schedule Table 14 lays out a reasonable hazard assessment schedule fo r a small water system. The timeframes listed under the schedu le column start from the initia tion of the water system’s CCC program.

--- Page 99 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Table 14 Hazard Assessment Schedule Hazard Assessment Task Schedule from Cross- Connection Control Program Start-Up Establish policy Within 6 months Identify high hazard facilities (Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490) for mandatory premises isolation Within 9 months Identify supplemental facilities for premises isolation (e.g., all commercial customers) Within 12 months Identify residential customers with “special plumbing or activities” on their property Within 15 months Purveyor may use their bi lling records, business license inform ation, and/or the telephone book "Yellow Pages" to identify potential commercial, industrial, and other non-single family residential customers. This list ca n be used to make a rough appraisal of the number of co nnections in each non-residential hazard categor y. For small towns and cities, the local busine ss licensing agency is often a very good source of information fo r identifying non-residential customers. Once the rough appraisal is made, the next step is to determine if a customer actually "fits" the hazard category . The purveyor’s CCS must make final hazard assessment decisions. Exceptions As mentioned previously, some customers that initially appear to fall into a high health hazard category requiring mandatory premis es isolation may actua lly pose only a moderate or low hazard to the public water system. For example, a build ing described as a medical clinic may contain only psychologists, and thus, would not fall into a high health hazar d category requiring premises isolation by an RPBA. However, if a tenant changed to a ph ysician or veterina rian, the building would require an RPBA for premises isolation. Other examples of premis es that initially appear to fall in to the high hazard category but pose a lower hazard are: • A “bottling plant” that only stores the fi nished product; and

--- Page 100 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 • A commercial dry cleaners or laun dromat that is used only to co llect or deliver clothes (i.e., the cleaning facility is located elsewhere). For these type facilities, the purveyor has the po licy choice to either: Require premises isolation from the start, based on the potential for a change in tenants/use; or Grant an exception to premis es isolation and frequently re -assess the hazar d to detect a change in tenants/use. Purveyors don’t have to obtain DOH concur rence to grant an exception to mandatory premises isolation for a high-hazar d category of customer of the type listed in Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490, where the customer's water use does not ”match” the high-hazard assessment. However, the purveyor's CCS must document the justification for waiving premises isolation by completing an Exceptions Report Form. Purveyors must submit Exception Report Forms to DOH with the ASR (see Sectio n 7.6). All exceptions granted by th e purveyor to the mandatory premises isolation list must be reported to DOH. Customer Notification Once the initial hazard asse ssment is complete, purv eyors must notify their customers of the results. The WAC states that the purveyor must notify th e customer, within a reas onable timeframe, to inform them of the assessment re sults and the requiremen ts for backflow prevention to protect the purveyor's system. To allow fo r purveyor flexibility, DOH has not established an absolute timeframe for issuing the assess ment notification for backflow preventer installation. However, to better protec t public health and for risk and liability manage ment, it is prudent for purveyors to notify customers as soon as possible of their: • Hazard assessment results; and • Responsibility to prevent c ontaminants from entering th eir potable water systems and the purveyor's distribution system. Table 15 presents a schedule that can be used by a small water system fo r notifying customers of hazard assessment results. The sc hedule starts from the date of completion of the hazard assessment.

--- Page 101 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Table 15 Hazard Notification Schedule Hazard Notification Ca tegory Schedule from Completion of Hazard Assessment* Customers assessed as a high health hazard (Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 facilities) Within 3 months Customers assessed as requiring premises isolation (supplemental to Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 fac ilities) Within 6 months All other customers wh ere purveyor chooses to rely upon in-premises backflow assemblies Within 6 months * This schedule is considered to meet th e “reasonable time frame” requirements of the WAC. Under Washington Law, it is a gross misdemeanor for any owner or operator to knowingly permit, or by omission allow, the co ntamination of a water system (see Section 5.3 for RCW wording). 2.2 Schedule for P eriodic Re-Assessment Per the WAC, the purveyor must periodically re-assess the cross-connection hazard posed by all connections served by the system. However, the purveyor’s rea ssessment efforts can focus on customers other than those with premises isolation AGs or RPBAs , as long as annual test reports are satisfactory for the premis es isolation backflow preventers. Customers with premises isolation AGs or RPBAs already have installed the maximu m backflow protection . How often should hazard reassessm ents be done? The frequency of periodic hazard re-assessments should be based on th e potential risk the customer poses to the purveyor's water system. Due to resource limitations, most systems will need to phase the scheduling of hazard re- assessments. Customers that po se the greatest risk to the wa ter system (i.e., non-residential customers) should have their hazard reassessments scheduled first. Once th e higher risk customers have been addressed, assessments for lower risk (i.e., residential) customers can be scheduled.

--- Page 102 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Priorities (listed from highest to lowest) for schedu ling re-assessments sh ould be given to: Non-residential customers: a. Without premises isolation DCVAs, i.e., where in -premises backflow preventers protect the public water system from c ontamination (e.g., industrial building that is likely to have changes in the plumbing); b. With premises isolation DCVAs, where changes in tenants or plumbing could raise the risk to high hazard (e.g., strip malls where a building occupa ncy could change to include a medical clinic); and Residential customers (the water use questionnaire can be used for re-a ssessments). Per the WAC, a re-assessment is also required whenever there is a change in the use of the premises. This is because a change in use often results in a change in the ha zard posed to the water system. Hazard assessment changes may trigger: • A requirement for a premises isolation back flow preventer, wher e no preventer was previously required or where the purveyor relied on in-premise s preventers; or • An upgrade to a more reliable preventer (i .e., DCVA to RPBA), where a less reliable preventer was previously required. Table 16 lays out a reasonable hazard re-assessment schedule fo r a small water system. The schedule starts from the date of the initial hazard assessment. Table 16 Hazard Re-Assessment Schedule Hazard Re-Assessment Task Schedule Customers assessed as a high health hazard (Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 facilities) and protected by a premises isolation AG or RPBA Not required as long as annual test results are satisfactory Customers assessed as requiring premises isolation (supplemental to Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 fac ilities) Within 2 years if DCVA installed Customers where in-premises backflow assemblies are relied upon by purveyor Within 2 years All residential customers where purveyor relies upon compliance with Uniform Plumbing CodeWithin 2-3 years (questionnaire)

--- Page 103 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 2.3 Schedule for Back flow Prevention Assemblies Installation Once the initial hazard asse ssment is complete and the customer has been not ified, the WAC states that the purveyor shall develop and implement procedures for: • Eliminating cross connections; or • Controlling cross connections by installation of approv ed backflow preventers commensurate with the degree of hazard in situations where cross connect ions cannot be eliminated. Cross connections are eliminated by removal of points of use of water (e.g., plumbing fi xtures) or removing sources of contaminants (e.g., abandoning a private well according to Washington State Department of Ecology specifications). It is not possible to elim inate all cross connections on the customer's premises. A hazard assessment determines if the custom er's cross connections are "controlled" to the satisfaction of the purveyor. If contro l is not satisfactory , the purveyor must: Install an approved backflow preventer for premises isolation; Get the customer to install an approved ba ckflow preventer for premises isolation; or Get the customer to install in-premises approv ed backflow preventers (for fixture protection or area isolation) that provide equivalent (to premises isolation) protection for the purveyor's system. Whichever is the case, the purvey or must establish a schedule for the installation of the backflow preventer(s). To gi ve flexibility to purveyors, DOH has not established an absolute de adline for the installation of backflow prevente rs once a hazard assessment for an existing customer has been done. However, for public health protection and liability manage ment reasons, backflow preventers should be installed as soon as possible after the need for a preventer is identified.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 For liability management reasons, it is in the purveyor's best interest to have assemblies installed as soon as possible. The installation of backflow preven tion assemblies may be a significant cost to the purveyor and/or customer. For new customers , the cost of a backflow prevente r for premises isolation or in- premises alternatives will constitu te a very small amount compared with the overall project budget if they are required at the time of construction. Thus, the requirement for the installation of a BPA before service is provided is not an undue burd en to the customer. For existing customers and/or the purveyor, the cost of insta lling backflow preven ters as a retrofit may be significant compared with the customer's annual operating budg et. Except where an immediate high health hazard has been identified, it is reas onable to work with the customer and to allow them enough time to fund the installation of backflow prev ention assemblies required by the purveyor. Table 17 provides a schedule that lays out “a r easonable timeframe” for an existing customer of a small water system to install a backflow assembly or assemblies. The timeframes presented start from the date the custom er was notified of th e hazard assessment.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 2.4 Communication with Customers The CCC Program Manager should be responsible for all initial communication with customers. The initial communicat ion should include: • Notification of the water system’s policy (or ch ange in policy) to establish a CCC program; • Public education mate rials describing the need fo r cross-connection control; and • Hazard assessment information, i. e., either the distribution of water use questionnaires or the scheduling of a cross-co nnection hazard survey. The purveyor's CCS may handle subsequent communication wi th customers regarding the CCC program. Sample letters, public education materials, and forms are provid ed in Appendix D. Additional resource materials may be found in the PN WS-AWWA manuals and US C Manual listed in Appendix F. 2.5 Requirements of Existing Customers Under WAC 246-290-490, purveyors must protect the public water system from the cross- connection hazards posed by its customers. Unless the purveyo r has specific knowledge to the contrary, for existing customers, the purveyor must assume that: • All customers were in compliance with the plumbi ng code in effect at th e time the certificate of occupancy was issued for their premises; and • No significant plumbing changes have occurred (i.e., that would require a new plumbing permit) since the cer tificate was issued. The Local Administrative Authority, i.e., plumbing inspect or, has jurisdiction over matters of public health and safety within the property lines of the customer’s premises. The customer's plumbing is considered to be "reasonably" sa fe, if it complies with the heal th-related parts of the Uniform Plumbing Code. However, unlike the drinking water regulations, th e customer is "vested" with respect to the Uniform Plumbing Code. Thus, Local Administrative Authoriti es can’t require a change in the customer’s plumbing system to bring the plumbing into complia nce with the most recently a dopted code, unless the Local Administrative Authority has spec ific knowledge of a health or safety hazard. Also, the Local Administrative Authority doesn’t have the authority to make ra ndom plumbing inspections, once certificates of occupancy have been issued.

--- Page 108 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Despite efforts by the Local Ad ministrative Authorities to ensure complianc e with the Uniform Plumbing Code, experience has shown that some customers make plumbing changes without the proper permits and thus, their plumbing doesn’t comply with the plumbing code in effect at the time of construction. Also, the plum bing of many other existing cu stomer premises may not comply with the most recently adopted plumbing code. If the purveyor requires a backflow preventer for premises isolation (i.e., purveyor installs or requires customer to install), prior to installation: The purveyor should notify the customer: a. Of the reason for the backflow prevente r installation (e.g., gene ral policy for a meter check; to isolate an existing lawn irrigation system); and b. That the backflow preventer will prevent thermal expansion from being relieved through the distribution main, and thus, the customer should ensure that his plumbing has adequate safety protection (e.g., pressure temperature relief valve on the hot water tank, and an expansion tank). The purveyor should notify the Local Admi nistrative Authority (LAA) (plumbing inspector) of any backflow preventer and/or meter check to be installed by the purveyor, so that the LAA may inspect the customer's premises for thermal expansion protection. 2.6 Cross Connections in Purveyor's System An essential component of the purveyor's CCC progra m is to provide protection from cross connections at purveyor -owned facilities. Th ese facilities include: • Office and mainte nance buildings; • Water treatment plants; and • Water distribution mains. Office and maintenance facilities should be evaluated us ing the same criteria used for assessing a customer's premises. For fac ilities constructed on parcels of land owned by the purveyor, the purveyor must also comply with the Uniform Plumbing Code requi rements enforced by the Local Administrative Authority (plumbing inspector). If the purveyor is an agency of a city, town, or count y, municipal facilities su ch as water and sewage treatment plants, parks, commun ity centers, government buildin gs, and shops must also be evaluated for cross-connection control.

--- Page 109 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 There are a number of common cros s connections typically found in purveyor-owned facilities. These may include cr oss connections in: Water treatment plant including: a. The discharge of filter backwash and rinse water to waste; b. Potable water connections to chemical injectors or pumps; c. Sampling lines that connect a meter to both raw and treated (finished) water; d. By-pass connections between raw and treated water storage; e. Surface washers; f. Hydraulically operated filter effluent valves; g. Chlorinators connected to bot h raw and treated water; and h. Common walls between finished and unfinished water. Distribution system including: a. Air release and vacuum valves; b. Temporary connections for ne w water main disinfection; c. Fire hydrants, standpipes when used for: i. Filling tanker trucks; or ii. Flushing water mains or sewers. The following manuals lis t typical distribution system hazards and the recommended backflow prevention: • Cross-Connection Control Manual, Accepted Procedure and Practice , published by the Pacific Northwest Section, American Wate r Works Association (PNWS-AWWA); and • Manual of Cross -Connection Control, published by the University of Sout hern California Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydr aulic Research.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 For liability and public relations reasons, it is prudent for purveyors to provide cross-connection control for all purveyor-owned facilities, before asking customers to spend money for backflow preventer installation and testing. 2.7 Common Cross Connections Associated with Small Water Systems Small water systems often serve ma ny premises (and wate r uses) that pose cr oss-connection hazards to the public water system. Some of these hazards are listed on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490(4). However, other specific h azards encountered in the sy stem may not be listed. Many large water systems have developed extensiv e lists of hazardous premises they serve and identify the required backflow protect ion. Tables 19 and 20 list some hazards th at may be served by small water systems and the required/recommended backflow protection for each type of hazard or premises. For ease of use, the tables are divided into residential and commercial hazards respectively.

Most CCC technical publications also list customers requ iring mandatory premises isolation. These lists were developed based on assessments of severe or very high degrees of hazard. The assessments are often confirmed by reports of well -documented backflow incidents. Between the various technical publications and st ate regulations, there may be different customer categories listed for mandato ry premises isolation. At a minimum, the pu rveyor must comply with the premises isol ation requirements of WAC 246-290-490(4). It should be noted that the WAC gives purveyors the option to require premises isolation for connections serving premises not identified on Table 9 of WAC 2 46-290-490. These include prem ises such as tall buildings, premises with complex plumbing or plumbing subj ect to frequent changes, and premises with a history of cross connections being established. Some purveyors supplement Table 9 of the WAC by adding other cu stomer categories (usually non- residential) to their system’s mandatory premises isolation list. Purveyors can obtain ideas for additional categories in te chnical manuals, such as: • Manual of Cross-Connection Control , published by the University of Southern California - Foundation for Cro ss-Connection Control & Hydraulic Research (USC-FCCCHR); and

--- Page 113 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 • Cross-Connection Control Manual, Accepted Procedure and Practice , published by the Pacific Northwest Section - Amer ican Water Works Association. 3.1 Washington State Requirem ents for Fire Pr otection Systems In Washington, the Uniform Plum bing Code requires backflow pr evention for all fire protection systems, except for flow-throu gh or combination systems for residential services. A flow-through fire system : • Uses a different piping system from the consumer’s potable water piping; • Is constructed of approved potable water pipi ng and materials to wh ich sprinkler heads are attached; and • Ends at a connection to a toilet or other plumbing fixture to prevent the water in the pipe from becoming stagnant. In a combination fire system , the potable water piping and materi als serve both th e fire sprinkler system and the consumer’s potable water system. WAC 246-290-490 requires the purv eyor to ensure that backflow protection consistent with the UPC is installed. Th e UPC requires minimum protection as follows: • An RPBA or RPDA for fire protection systems with chemical addition or using an unapproved auxiliary water supply; and • A DCVA or DCDA for all other fire protection systems. Purveyors can easily meet this requirement for new services. Purveyors can stipulate in the service agreement (i.e., application for new service) th at the customer must co mply with the current Uniform Plumbing Code before service is provided. For existing customers, the purveyors may only request co mpliance from the cu stomer, or install a backflow preventer on the service for premises isol ation. By defining "hig h health cross-connection hazard" and specifying the appropria te approved backflow preventer as an AG, RPBA or RPDA, by default, a fire protection system requiring a DCVA or DCDA is a "low health cross-connection hazard.” This may undermine the purveyor's enforcement of a DCVA for public health protection reasons. For existing customers, purveyors can requ ire compliance in situations where the customer has a change in water use, remodels the premises, etc.

--- Page 114 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 The purveyor is not an enforcement agency for the Uniform Plumbing Code. An existing customer may be "vested" w ith respect to the Uniform Plumbing Code. If a backflow preventer is not currently in place, neither the purveyor nor the Local Administrative Authority (plumbing inspector) has authority to require compliance with the current UPC. However, if the customer do es not install the required backflow prevention asse mbly, the purveyor must install an assembly on the service. Table 21 provides guidance for scheduling the insta llation of backflow preven ters on fire sprinkler systems for existing customer connections. Th e schedule starts from the purveyor’s hazard assessment notice to the customers. Table 21 Backflow Prevention fo r Fire Sprinkler Systems on Existing Customer Connections Fire System Hazard Catego ry Schedule of Backflow Preventer Installation High health hazard fire systems (with chemical addition and/or auxiliary supply) Within 2 years All other fire systems Within 10 years The purveyor should notify the Local Fire Marshal whenever a backflow prev enter is installed on a fire service or on a combined fire and domestic service, since the added pressure loss through the backflow assembly may a ffect the design of the fire system.

--- Page 115 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 3.2 Purveyor's Additional Requirements WAC 246-290-490 estab lishes minimum requirements for CCC programs. However, under the WAC, water purveyors may devel op more stringent program require ments than those of the state and/or local levels of government (i.e., the county). When adding new requirements or making more stringent requi rements, it is important for purveyors to: • Establish justification for the added requirement (i.e., show that the decision was not arbitrary or capricious and that the added requirement can reasonably be met by the customer); and • Maintain consistency in th eir application to custom ers served by the system. Justification for a dditional requirements may be based on: • Following good engineering and public health practice as outlin ed in technical publications; and • Adopting a policy to further limit the purveyor's risk and liability (e.g., by requiring DCVAs on all commercial customers). Consistency may require that the purveyor apply the more stringent requirements: • Equally to new and existing customers; and • To similar hazard categories. 4 Requirements for Back flow Assembly Testing Backflow assemblies are mechanic al devices subject to fouling an d wear. History has shown that backflow preventers that are not tested periodically will not be ma intained or repa ired. Backflow preventers that are not ma intained or repaired have a much highe r likelihood of failure. Similarly, AGs that are not inspected periodical ly may be by-passed or re-plumbed. Testing Frequency Backflow assemblies and AGs used in place of assemblies relied up on by the purveyor to protect the public water system must be inspected for proper installation an d tested for prop er operation. WAC 246-290-490 (7)(b) requires inspections and/or testing: At the time of installation;

--- Page 116 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Annually after installation (minimum frequency); After a backflow incident; and After an assembly is repa ired, reinstalled, or relocated (or an AG is re-plumbed). Atmospheric vacuum breakers on residential lawn irrigation systems, if relie d upon by the purveyor to protect the public water system, must also be inspected for pr oper installation per WAC 246-290-490 (7)(c): • At the time of installation; • After a backflow incident; and • After repair, reinstallation or relocation. Because a test procedure for the AVB has not been established, some purveyors require a PVBA or DCVA on all lawn irrigation systems, so that all preventers relied upon by the purveyor are testable. A lawn irrigation system for a residential customer poses no less a hazard than an irrigation system for a commercial customer. The UPC establishes backflow protection requirements for irrigation systems, and as amended for Washington, allows an RPBA, PVBA, DCVA, or an AVB for backflow protection for ir rigation system without chemical addition. Test Procedures WAC 246-290-490 requires backflow prevention assemblies (relie d upon by the pur veyor to protect the public water system) to be te sted using procedures acceptable to DOH, such as th ose specified in the most recently publ ished edition of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control , published by the University of Southern California Foundation for Cross-Connection Contro l & Hydraulic Research. Copies of the field te st procedures are availa ble from DOH on request.

--- Page 117 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 It should be noted that the testing requirements in the most recently published edition of the Cross-Connection Control Manual, Accepted Procedure and Practice , published by the Pacific Northwest Section, American Water Works Associ ation are more stringe nt (supplemental tests required) than the test procedures specified by USC. Therefore, it is important that the purveyor adopts as a policy and notifies the customer if the more stringent PNWS-AWWA test requirements are to be followed. An example of the supplemental testing requirements of the PNWS-AWWA Manual for RPBAs is that the RPBA relief valve tests include a check to verify the relief valve will continue to open and discharge water. Most small water systems specify the use of the standard Washington Stat e Department of Health Approved Field Test Procedures. As discussed in Sectio n 6.2.7, purveyors have the option of testing the assembly (purveyor's certified staff or purveyor-contract ed certified BAT), or requiring the customer to employ a BAT to perform the test and submit a test report to the purveyor. The purveyor may also elect to make the initial test of an assembly, bu t require the customer to arrange for all subsequent tests. Testing Notification Regardless whether the purveyor or assembly owne r is responsible for te sting, the small water system purveyor should schedule the tests of all asse mblies that protect the public water system at the same time of the year. This approach makes it easier for the purveyor to administer the testing portion of the cro ss-connection program. In addition, BATs will of ten reduce their testing fees when they can arrange to test several assemb lies in one area. If the assembly owner is responsible for testing, purveyors should: Notify the customer in writing and allow at least one month from the date of notification for the testing to be done and the test report to be returned; Include, in the testing notifi cation letter, a statement affirmin g the understanding that service is provided based on the customer's agreemen t to test, maintain, an d repair the assemblies required by the purveyor (if a written service agreement is not in place); Specify the acceptable fiel d testing method (e .g., the DOH field test procedures); Provide a list of lo cal testers (BATs); and Provide a test report form for ea ch assembly owned by the customer.

--- Page 118 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 A public listing of the DOH -certified BATs will be available from DOH sometime in the future. DOH does not currently require that one “standardi zed” test report form be used in Washington. This approach gives purveyors the flexibility to design their test report forms for ease of data entry into their respective CCC databases. However, all test reports should provide the same basic information needed by the purveyor. It is hoped that the minimum elements of an acceptable test report form will be addressed in future CCC-related regulation revisions. Because the minimum elements of an acceptable test report are not currently specified in the drinking water regulations, purveyors must identify test report contents as part of their testing quality assurance/quality control pr ogram (Element 6 of WAC 246-290-490). A sample test report form is included in Appendi x D. Other sample test re port forms are available: • In technical CCC guidance manuals from PNWS-AWWA and/or USC; • From national organizations such as the ABPA; and • From regional CCC groups in Washingt on, such as SRC4 and “The Group.” • To obtain test report forms from the a bove sources, see Appendix F for contact information. • It should be noted that the regional CCC groups in Washi ngton are in the process of developing a standardized test report form for voluntary use by their members. Many BATs support the standardized test report form concept since it eliminates the need for BATs to keep track of and use different test report forms in different service areas (i.e., a different form for each purveyor). Purveyors may choose to address the requirement fo r a periodic hazard re-a ssessment at the same time they address assembly testing. For purveyo rs that conduct their ow n hazard re-assessments, a water use questionnaire can be included with the te sting notice for customers. Purveyors that rely on hazard re-assessments conducte d by customer-employed CCSs ma y include with the assembly testing notice: • A notification letter for the cu stomer to employ a certified CCS to re-survey the premises (the CCS’s re-assessment should either c onfirm that the existi ng assemblies are commensurate with the degree of hazard or recommend a dditional and/or different assemblies); and • A list of local CCSs providing contract services. A list of contract operators wh o are certified CCSs is availabl e from the DOH website. Regional CCC groups may also maintain lis ts of experienced CCSs who are w illing to contr act with small water system customers for hazard surveys. See Appendix F for resource information.

--- Page 119 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 It should be noted that the purveyor only has a contract relati onship with the customer. In other words, purveyors have no contract relations hip with the customer's BAT or CCS. Thus, all purveyor communication about te sting and surveys should be wi th the customer, not with the customer’s backflow assembly tester or cross-connection co ntrol specialist (third party) . Purveyors should send the notices for testing direct ly to their customers. Both the BAT and the customer should sign the completed test report form , and the customer should return the completed form to the purveyor. This appr oach accomplishes the following: • Establishes a record that the customer was made aw are of any deficiencies listed in the report form by the BAT; and • Re-affirms, by signature, the customer's agreem ent to test and mainta in the assemblies as a condition of service. Copies of sample testing notifi cation and hazard re-survey letters are included in Appendix D. The CCC Program Manager should review test and su rvey forms as so on as possible after they are submitted. For CCC Program Ma nagers that are not certified CCSs, the purveyor's CCS should provide guidance on what to look for in the initial review (e.g., the test fo rm is complete, and the data shows that the assemb ly passed the test). Ba sed on the initial review: • If the test report form is incomplete, the CCC Program Manager should notify the customer of the deficiency (and may, as a courtesy, choose to also notif y the BAT at th e same time); • If the test report form show s that the assembly failed the field test, the CCC Program Manager should give written notice to the custom er to repair or replac e the assembly within a specified timeframe (e .g., one month). This is the st art of enforcement procedures. If the CCC Program Manager has concerns about a test report, the contract CCS should be contacted for technical assistance. Figure 4 shows a typical testing proc ess for a small pub lic water system. If the purveyor’s cross-connection control program relies upon third party backflow assembly tester or cross- connection control specialist for hazard surveys, the purveyor has a contract relatio nship with the owner, not with the owner’s cross-conne ction control specialist or backflow assembly tester. All purveyor communication fo r surveys and tests should only be with the building/assembly owner.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Purveyors should consider coordi nating their test notices with the test notices issued by the Local Administrative Authority (LAA). Coordination of test notices will benefit the purveyor’s customers. The customer may have assemblies within his prem ises that are not relied upon by the purveyor for the protection of the distribution system . The cost for testing may be reduced, if the customer arranges to have all as semblies on the property (premises isolation and fixture protection) tested at one time. Also, where purveyors rely on in-premises assemblies to protect the public water system, the annual test reports required by the pu rveyor may be used to show compliance with the Uniform Plumbing Code. When coordinating test notices with the test notices issued by the LAA, the purveyor' s testing letter to the customer should clearly state that the: • Customer is to return test reports to the purveyor only for the assemblies specified; • Other assemblies owned by the cu stomer should be tested to comply with the Uniform Plumbing Code; and • If applicable, test reports subm itted to the purveyor may also be used to comply with the Uniform Plumbing Code testing requirements. For combined programs (see Sec tion 6.2.2), the coordination ma y include a provision for the purveyor to collect test report forms for all assemb lies within the property lines of the customer's premises. Regardless of the level of coordination with the LAA, the purveyor may receive completed test reports for assemblies not on the purveyor's list (i.e ., not relied upon by the purveyor to protect the public water system. For many purv eyors it is preferable for the pur veyor just to return the reports to the customer, rather th an take on the responsib ility for forwarding them to the appropriate Local Administrative Authority. This is especially tr ue for purveyors who coordinate with many LAAs. When returning the report forms to customers, the purveyor s hould advise the customer of the correct LAA to ma il the form to. Sample notification letters are provided in Appendix D. Additional samples of letter and forms may be found in referenced publicat ions listed in Appendix F. 4.1 Approved Backflow Assembly Testers A DOH-certified backflow assembly tester (BAT) mu st conduct all field test s of assemblies relied upon by the purveyor to protect the water system. The publ ic listing of certifie d testers should be available from the DOH Office of Drinking Water website in the future. The website address is: http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/dw

--- Page 122 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Purveyors should maintain a list of local certified asse mbly testers, so th at the CCC Program Manager: • Can verify the tester's certification status wh en checking completed test reports; and • May provide the list to customers along with the testing notice. In addition to DOH BAT certificat ion, purveyors may specify additi onal conditions that must be met by BATs who want to provid e testing in the purv eyor’s service area. These conditions may specify that the BAT must: • Also be certified as a CCS; • Have a local business license; • Be a registered contractor (iss ued by Washington State Depart ment of Labor and Industries [L&I]); and • Use purveyor-approved testing eq uipment and show proof of a recent verification of test equipment accuracy and calibration (if needed). The Local Administrative Author ity may also enforce minimum qu alifications for BATs. The Uniform Plumbing Code amendmen ts in Washington require assemb lies to be tested by a DOH- certified BAT (See WA C 51-46-0603.3.2). WAC 246-290-490 and the Unifor m Plumbing Code (amended fo r Washington) both require DOH BAT certification. However, pu rveyors need to be aware that additional certifications and/or registrations may be required for persons provid ing backflow assembly in stallation, maintenance and/or repair services. As mentioned in Chap ter 3, RCW 18.106 (enfor ced by L&I) establishes minimum standards for persons in stalling, repairing, and/or replacing backflow prevention assemblies within buildings. Under this RCW, only licensed plum bers can install, maintain, repair, and/or replace backflow assemblies within buildings. BATs who also hold a specia lty plumber certification from L&I may test and repair assemblies within buildings. In addition, RCW 18.27 establishes the requirements for contractor registration, and some BATs may be required to also be registered contractors. Thus, multiple statutes/regulati ons may apply to persons working on assemblies in the purveyor’s service area, depending on where the asse mblies are located (within building vs. outside a building), and whether services in addition to testing are provided. Purveyor s must check on the certification status of BATs to comply with WAC 246-290-490. Ho wever, L&I does not expect purveyors to “police” or enforce contractor registration and/or plumber ce rtification requirements.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Current DOH tester certification is limited to demons trating a minimum leve l of knowledge in assembly field test procedures an d installation requiremen ts. BAT certification doesn’t certify that an individual can properly install and/or repair an assembly. BATs who ho ld the specialty plumber certification issued by L&I have su ccessfully passed a written exam on assembly repair, in addition to the BAT written and hands-on exam. 4.2 Quality Assurance Program WAC 246-290-490 re quires purveyors to develop a testing quality assurance/quality control program. This program must: • Document that test reports are su bmitted by DOH-certified testers; • Document the type of test kit us ed, serial number, and that the test kit has been verified for accuracy within the last year and calibrated if necessary (s ome test kits can’t be re- calibrated), • Specify the minimum content of test reports (to be acceptable to the purv eyor) and establish procedures for test report review; and • Establish a timeframe for complete d test reports to be submitted to the purveyor (e.g., within 10 working days from the date the test was performed). Most large purveyors maintain mu ch of this tester quality assu rance informatio n in their CCC Program databases. Program Manage rs that have this tester inform ation readily ava ilable can more effectively and efficiently admini ster their CCC programs. For ex ample, some systems enter the certification numbers of testers into their CCC databases, so that any test reports submitted by non- certified testers will automatically be rejected. To comply with the quality assu rance/quality control requirement, purveyors of small systems may rely upon information prov ided by another nearby u tility (i.e., larger) that ha s an established quality assurance program. This could incl ude proof of test kit accuracy verification and calibration and the list of approved testers. Although small water sy stem CCC Program Managers may con duct the initial reviews of test reports for completeness, they may not have the traini ng to assess the details in the report. The test report details may show that: • An assembly is wearing out and needs to be repaired or replaced; and • The BAT improperly tested the assembly or falsified the test results.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 The purveyor's CCS (either on staff or contract ) should have the trai ning and experience to review test reports for quality assurance purposes. The reviews s hould be made at least annually, and preferably more often, if previous reviews show problems (e.g., questionable BAT performance). The purveyor's cross-conn ection control specialist should report any questionable backflow assembly tester performance to Washington State De partment of Health Operator Certification Program. 5 Enforcement Procedures When the purveyor provides good public education material on cross-connection control to customers, 99 percent of the customers will volunt arily comply with the pu rveyor's requirements. For the other one percent, from the very start of the CCC progra m, the purveyor should anticipate the need to take some form of corrective or enforcement action agai nst non-complying customers. Purveyors should be pro-active and establish their enforcement policies before any enforcement action is required . The purveyor's management sta ff and lawyer should be involved in establishing the enfor cement policy. The policy lays out in detail the en forcement procedures to be followed by the CCC Program Manager. The purveyor’s enforcement procedur es should address the following: • The number of subsequent notices to be sent (after the initial notice), befo re the purveyor takes an enforcement action; • The time interval between notices; • Use of registered mail for subsequent notices; • The wording of notices (e.g., po lite reminder for the second noti ce, and an ulti matum for the final notice); • For in-premises assemblies, when to inform the Local Administra tive Authority of the problem; • When to notify the purveyor's management, and/or lawyer;

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 • An appeal process; and • Which enforcement procedure to take for the various as sessed “degrees of hazard.” Figure 5 shows an example enforcement procedure. Examples of enforcemen t notices are included in Appendix D. Purveyors need to be aware that th e failure of an assembly to pass the initial or annual field test doesn’t establish for certain that the assembly will fa il to prevent backflow . Failure may only indicate that the desire d level of reliability is not present. Thus, when laying out enforcement procedures, purveyors should make the enforcemen t action appropriate for the hazard posed. DOH has developed guidance regarding when purveyors sh ould shut-off water and when they should use other enforcement tools to pr otect the public water supply. Shutting off the supply of water to a customer may cause a health hazard and/or a financial loss. Purveyors should have enforcement tools other than water shut-off also available, such as installing or testing the backflow preventer and billing the customer.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 6 Record-Keeping and Reporting Requirements Purveyors should keep a ll original records (corres pondence, plans, etc.) in the water system's files. If contractors (i.e., CCSs) are used, the cont ractors should give the original reco rds to the water system and retain photocopies of the records in their own files. If a contract cross-connec tion control specialist or manager's employment ceases, the purveyor may have di fficulty recovering files and records that are retained at any location other than the purveyor's office files. Original records should always be kept in the water system’s files. 6.1 Record of Risk Assessment For each customer, the purveyor shall maintain a r ecord of the initial ri sk assessment and subsequent re-assessments, in the form of a completed: • Water Use Questionnaire (i.e., for residential customers); and/or • Cross-Connection Survey Report. Samples of each may be found in Appendix D, Sample Forms. For risk management reasons, the purveyor should re tain both the initial fo rm, plus the latest re- assessment, because the forms: • Document that th e purveyor has complied with the DOH requirement to evaluate new and existing customers to assess the degree of hazard; • Provide a historical perspective that may be needed by a new CCS, Program Manager, or supervisor; • Contain a signed statement from the customer or customer's CC S about his water use, and/or assessed degree of hazard; and • Contain information useful for inve stigating a backflow incident.

--- Page 128 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 For each connection where the purve yor requires a backflow prevente r to protect the public water system, records should be kept indicating the assessed hazard level of the connection and the required backflow preventer. 6.2 Inventory of Backflow Preventers It is critical for purveyors to keep accurate record s on backflow preventers that protect the public water system from contamination. These may include both purveyor-owned assemblies and customer-owned assemblies. WAC 246-290-490 (3)(j)(ii) lists the minimum backflow prevente r inventory information that purveyors must keep on file. For each customer where an approved BPA or AG is required by the purveyor to protect its distributio n system, and for approved back flow preventers installed at purveyor- owned facilities, the inventory should include {per WAC 246-290-490(3), Element 9}: • Information on the exact location of the backflow preventer or AG (adequate details to find the backflow preventers); • Description of hazard isolated (either the category of premises such as a medical clinic or the fixture such as a boiler); • Type, size, make, model, serial number and installatio n date of backflow assembly, or AG details including installation date; and • Size, make, model and installation date of AVBs used on irrigation systems. 6.3 Inventory of Backflow P reventer Test/Inspection Reports For each assembly field test or AG inspection, th e test report inventory information should include at a minimum: • The name and certification number of the BAT performing each test or inspection; • Test results (pass/fail and actual re adings) or inspec tion results; and • Repair/re-plumbing history. Appendix D contains a sample file record form that incl udes the inventory of backflow preventers and test reports.

--- Page 129 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 6.4 Correspondence The purveyor should maintain copies of all corresp ondence with customers for a period of at least five years. The purveyor should also maintain, as a permanent record, the: • Most current service agreemen t with each cu stomer; and • Notification to the customer to install a back flow preventer(s) to pr otect the public water system from contamination. All correspondence with DOH and th e Local Administrative Authority should be maintained for at least five years. 6.5 Washington State Department of Health Reporting Requirements Purveyors are required to meet the reporting requirements of WAC 246-290-490. These requirements include completing the CCC Annual Summary Report (ASR) fo rms and making them available to DOH on request. Copies of the current fo rms (there are three) are available from DOH. However, DOH will send purveyors the forms and ask them to submit to DOH information on their CCC programs. These forms comprise the ASR forms. The forms provi de a means for purveyor s to report on the: • Status of their writte n program plans; • Progress of their implem entation activities; and • Exceptions they have granted and the justific ations for granting of the exemptions. An example set of ASR forms for 2002 is provided in Appendix E. 6.6 Spreadsheets and Computer Database Software For the number of assemblie s expected in most small water system s, the records of the inventory of assemblies, test reports, local BATs, etc., can be kept on a spreadsheet, either manually (i.e., on paper), or using commercially available comput er software (such as Excel or Access). Proprietary computer database software programs ar e also available. Thes e have been developed specifically to aid purveyors in the management of their CCC programs. A list of some of the companies supplying computer software for managing CCC pr ograms is provided in Appendix F. Regardless of the type of record-keeping system used , the system must be able to provide the data to answer the questions that app ear on the CCC ASR forms.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 6.7 Backflow In cident Reports Element 9 of WAC 246-290-490 re quires purveyors to ma intain CCC records an d complete annual summary reports and backflow incide nt reports. Backflow incidents are to be report ed on a form acceptable to DOH. A sample backflow incident report form developed by the PNWS-AWWA CCC Committee is provided in Ap pendix D. Additional supporting information, photos, laboratory analyses, etc., may be attached to the report. The PNWS-AWWA form is currently acceptable to DOH. In the futu re, DOH may develop a Backflow Incident Report Form that is design ed for computer entry and future web-based submission. If a backflow incident occurs, check with DOH to ensure that your system has the most current form to report the details of the incident. 7 Public Education Public education is a key part of the purveyor's CCC program. Through pu blic education programs, purveyors inform customers of: • The public health impacts of po tential cross-connection hazards; • Their responsibility to protect the public water system from contamination; • The purveyor's re quirement to comply with the DOH regulations; and • The purveyor's policies (i.e., conditions of service). 7.1 Type of Effort Element 8 of WAC 246-290-490 re quires purveyors to educate thei r customers on cross-connection control. For small water sy stems, the recommended pub lic education methods are: • Water bill inserts (brochures); • Consumer Confidence Reports; • For new customers, information on service policy distributed with application for service; and • Reliance on general public education material s developed by regional and national technical groups (PNWS-AWWA CCC Co mmittee, SRC4, The Group, and other technical organizations) and/or by large utilities.

--- Page 131 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 Appendix F lists organizations that have public e ducation brochures available for use by small water systems. Due to limited resour ces, small water systems are en couraged to use the education materials (brochures, postcards, newsletters, etc.) already developed by othe r organizations and/or systems. There is no need fo r a small water system to “re-in vent the wheel,” when so many excellent public education materials on cros s-connection control ar e readily available. 7.2 Frequency The annual Consumer Confidence Report pr ovides an excellent means for purveyors to routinely inform their customers about the status of th eir CCC programs. The purveyor’s Consumer Confidence Report should include a brief statement about the: • Purveyor's operation of a CCC program; and • Customer's responsibility to pr otect his/her plumbi ng system and the pur veyor's distribution system from contamination via cross connections. Education brochures should be distri buted every two to three years. 8 Backflow Incident Response Plan A purveyor’s failure to properly resp ond to a backflow incident may: • Significantly increase the number of persons exposed to a health hazard; • Increase the purveyor's effort (cost) to c ontain a contaminant and clean the contaminant from the distribution system; and • Expose the purveyor to increased liability from a clai m for punitive damages for negligence. Don't wait until a backfl ow incident occurs to develop an incident response plan! Appendix C contains a sample B ackflow Incident Response Pl an for a small water system. Purveyors should consult with th e Local Administrative Authorities and Local Health jurisdiction when developing the re sponse plan to identify communication lines, responsibilities, etc.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 9 Special Requirements fo r Reclaimed or Greywater Reclaimed Water Reclaimed water systems use wastewater treatment effluent that has been adequately and reliably treated, so that it is suitable for a direct beneficial use or a cont rolled use that wo uld not otherwise occur. The utilizatio n of reclaimed water is referred to as water reuse . A dual distribution system supplies two grades of water to the same serv ice area. One of the supplies is potable water (accept able for drinking), and the ot her supply is n on-potable (not acceptable for drinking). Reclaime d wastewater is typica lly categorized into f our classes of quality (A through D). The classes range from the highest qua lity (A) for use in irrigation of open access areas (golf courses, parks, school yard), non-restricted recreational impoundments, toile t flushing in commercial and industrial buildings, and fire protec tion systems to the lowest quality (D) for use in irrigation of non-food crops (e.g., tree farms) and sewer flushing. All classes of reclaimed wa ter shall be considered a high health hazard. This is because the degree of treatment of reclaimed wa ter is far less than the minimum requiremen ts for the production of potable water. Even the Cl ass A reclaimed water criteria allow water that could contain pathogens (disease-causing organisms). Due to the high health hazard, Department of Ecology standards prohibit direct connections between reclaimed water systems an d potable water systems. Further details can be found in the Water Reclamation and Reuse Sta ndards jointly published by th e Department of Ecology and Washington State Department of Heal th (Ecology publicat ion number 97-23). For connections where both reclaimed wate r and potable water are provided on the customer's premises, per Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490, premises isolation at the water meter by an approved AG or reduced-pressu re backflow assemb ly is required. The requirement is based on the asse ssment of a high health h azard of the reclaimed water, and the high probability that a connection could be made between the potable and non-potable systems (e.g., in the event of the disruption of the reclaimed wate r supply). Dual distri bution systems operated by the water utility shall adhere to the requirem ent for premises isolation. Where the customer uses potable water to suppleme nt a reclaimed water syst em, the water must be supplied through an approved AG inspected by a certified BAT at least annually. Greywater A greywater system uses the effluent from untreated house hold wastewater that hasn’t come into contact with toilet waste or food processing waste. Greywate r includes wastewater from bathtubs, showers, bathroom sinks, clot hes washing machines and laundr y tubs. Greywater excludes wastewater from kitchen sinks and dishwashers.

--- Page 133 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 7 A greywater system may supply water for undergro und landscape irrigation. The system typically contains one or more holding tanks, an undergro und distribution system connected to perforated irrigation pipe, an overflow gravity drain to the sewer or septic system, and a pump. All greywater systems sh all be considered a hi gh health hazard. This is due to the potential for the greywater to contain human pathogens, ev en if connections to toilets are excluded (e.g., bath water may contain human fecal material). Premises isolation at the water meter by an approv ed AG or reduced-pressure backflow assembly is required. The requireme nt is based on the: • Assessment of a high health h azard of the greywater; and • Probability that a connection could be made between the potable water system and greywater system to supple ment the greywater supply.

"Backflow" means the undesirable reversal of flow of water or other substances through a cross connection into the public water system or consumer's potable water system. "Backflow assembly tester" means a person holding a valid BAT certificate issued in accordance with chapter 246-292 WAC. "Backpressure" means a pressure (caused by a pump, el evated tank or piping, boiler, or other means) on the consumer's side of the service conn ection that is greater th an the pressure provided by the public water system and which may cause backflow. "Backsiphonage" means backflow due to a reduction in system pressure in the purveyor's distribution system and/or consumer's water system. "Combination fire protection system" means a fire sprinkler system that: • Is supplied only by the purveyor's water; • Does not have a fire department pumper connection; and • Is constructed of approved potable water pi ping and materials that serve both the fire sprinkler system and the consumer's potable water system. "Consumer" means any person receiving water from a public water system from either the meter, or the point where the service line conne cts with the distribution system if no meter is present. For purposes of cross-connection contro l, "consumer" means the owner or operator of a water system connected to a public wa ter system through a service connection.

(a) All community water systems shall co mply with the cross-connection control requirements specified in this section. (b) All non-community water systems shall appl y the principles and provisions of this section, including subsection (4)(b ) of this section, as applicable to protect the public water system from contamination via cross connections. Non-community systems that comply with subsection (4)(b) of this sect ion and the provisions of WAC 51-46-0603 of the UPC (which addresses the installation of backflow preventers at points of water use within the potable water system) shall be considered in compliance with the requirements of this section. (c) The purpose of the purveyor's cross-connecti on control program shall be to protect the public water system, as defined in WAC 246-290-010, from contamination via cross connections. (d) The purveyor's responsibility for cross-connec tion control shall begin at the water supply source, include all the public water treatment, storage, and distribution facilities, and end at the point of delivery to the consumer's water system, which begins at the downstream end of the service connecti on or water meter located on the public right-of-way or utility-held easement. (e) Under the provisions of this section, purve yors are not responsible for eliminating or controlling cross connections within the cons umer's water system. Under chapter 19.27 RCW, the responsibility for cross-connecti on control within the consumer's water system, i.e., within the prope rty lines of the consumer's premises, falls under the jurisdiction of the local administrative authority.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 (2) General program requirements. (a) The purveyor shall develop and implemen t a cross-connection control program that meets the requirements of this section, but may establish a more stringent program through local ordinances, resolutions, codes, bylaws, or operating rules. (b) Purveyors shall ensure that good engineeri ng and public health pr otection practices are used in the development and implementati on of cross-connection control programs. Department publications and the most recently published editions of references, such as, but not limited to, those listed below, ma y be used as guidance for cross-connection program development and implementation: (i) Manual of Cross-Connection Control published by the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Res earch, University of Southern California (USC Manual); or (ii) Cross-Connection Control Manual, Accepted Procedure and Practice published by the Pacific Northwest Section of th e American Water Works Association (PNWS-AWWA Manual). (c) The purveyor may implement the cross- connection control program, or any portion thereof, directly or by means of a contract w ith another agency or party acceptable to the department. (d) The purveyor shall coordinate with the lo cal administrative aut hority in all matters concerning cross-connection control. The pur veyor shall document and describe such coordination, including delineation of respons ibilities, in the wr itten cross-connection control program required in (e) of this subsection. (e) The purveyor shall include a written descri ption of the cross-conn ection control program in the water system plan required under WAC 246-290-100 or the small water system management program required under WAC 246-290-105. The cross-connection control program shall include the minimum program elem ents described in subsection (3) of this section. (f) The purveyor shall ensure th at cross connections between the distribution system and a consumer's water system are eliminated or controlled by the insta llation of an approved backflow preventer commensurate with the degree of hazard. This can be accomplished by implementation of a cross-conne ction program that relies on: (i) Premises isolation as defined in WAC 246-290-010; or (ii) Premises isolation and in-premise s protection as defined in WAC 246-290-010.

Do all non-community systems have to develop and implement Cross-Connection Control (CCC) Programs? A. Yes. The intent is to prov ide the same level of public he alth protection for non-community water systems as small Group A community syst ems. Non-community systems can use this manual as guidance fo r development and implementation of their CCC programs. Q. How do the minimum elem ents in Section 3 of Washi ngton Administrative Code (WAC) 246-290-490 a pply to non-community systems, especially single-purpose systems, where the purveyor and cu stomer are essentially the same? A. The elements of Section 3 apply to all Group A systems. Ho wever, the effort needed to comply may be minimal for some non-community systems. For a single-purpose system, it may only be necessary to confir m in a hazard assessment that protection of the source of supply is adequate. Depending on the natur e of the system, source protection could be achieved through installation of a backflow preven ter to directly protect the source and/or through installation of backflow preventers at the points of hazard (i.e., fixtures) per the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC ). A sample written CCC pr ogram for a non-community system is provided in Appendix B of this manual. The sample program contains the minimum elements listed in WAC 246- 290-490(3).

--- Page 154 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 Q. Was the intent for large non-community syst ems to "just" comply with the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC)? Woul d premises isolation ever be appropriate fo r a large non- community system? A. No, it was not the inte nt for large non-community systems to merely comply with the UPC. For most non-community system s, Washington Stat e Department of He alth (DOH) and the Local Administrative Authority (LAA) have overlapping jurisd ictions. Thus, non-community systems must comply with both WAC 246-290-490 and the UPC. Regarding the UPC, the non-community system must comp ly with the plumbing code in effect at the time the plumbing permit was issued (i.e ., at time of construction). Regarding WAC 246-290-490, prem ises isolation may be appr opriate, and in some cases required, for large non-community systems, depe nding on the types of hazards posed to the distribution system. The CCC requirements of WAC 246-290-490 are, in some cases, more stringent than the UPC, specifica lly in the area of mandatory pr emises isolation. So merely complying with the UPC would not provide the protection requ ired by the drinking water regulations. For a non-community system, area , building, and/or source isolation may be needed to protect the distribution system and source of supply from contamination via cross- connections (i.e., from being a conduit for the spread of contaminants between buildings or areas of concentration of population). Section 2 General Program Requirements Q. Do alternate references have to be accept able to Washington State Department of Health (DOH)? What criteria does DO H use to accept alternate references? A. The purveyor’s CCC program must be acceptable to DOH. The DOH regional engineer reviewing a CCC program will accept the two publications listed as guidance in WAC 246- 290-490. Alternate guida nce manuals may be acceptable, if certain criteria are met. The criteria DOH uses to accept alternate referenc es are: 1) The manual reflects current industry practices and standar ds; 2). The manual has been produced by a nationally recognized organization with ex pertise in cross-connection co ntrol, such as American Water Works Association (AWWA) , University of Southern California Foundation for Cross Connection Control and Hydraulic Rese arch (USCFCCCHR), American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA), or United St ates Environmental Pr otection Agency (EPA); and 3). The manual has und ergone association and/or peer review by AWWA, USCFCCCHR, ABPA, federal and/or state pub lic health officials and professional engineers. Q. Will the department develo p a "public listing" of Washin gton State De partment of Health (DOH) certified Cross- Connection Control Sp ecialists (CCSs) willing to act as consultants to small water systems? What are the guidelines for hiring a CCS?

--- Page 155 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 A. DOH has developed a contract ope rators public listing. All contract operators must be DOH-certified CCSs. The contra ct operators list is availabl e on the Office of Drinking Water’s website: http://www.doh.wa.gov/ DOH does not have a brochure developed that provid es specific guidelines for hiring a contract CCS. However, th is issue is discussed in detail in Chapter 7. Before hiring a CCS on contract, at a minimum, pu rveyors are strongly encourag ed to carefully check the CCS’s: • Familiarity with the most recently pu blished version of WAC 246-290-490; • Relevant experience with other similar water systems; • Extent of coordination with DOH headqua rters and regional office CCC staff; • Participation in the DOH CCC-related committees; • Participation in re gional and national CCC groups; and • Public water system (PWS) references (at least 3). Sample CCC written progra ms developed by the CCS should also be ava ilable for the purveyor to review. It is recommended that pr oposals be obtained from at least three CCSs. Some contract operators may have minimal experience in the development and implementation of CCC programs. Thus, in addition to the DOH Contract Operators list, purveyors are encouraged to network with thei r regional CCC groups for a list of more experienced consultant CCSs. Note: High prices do not necessarily indicate quality work. Contra cts should specify that the written CCC program pl an produced must comply with the curr ent WAC 246-290-490. Availability for technica l consultation on an as-needed basi s is an item to also consider including in the contract. Anot her suggestion is to include l anguage in the contract that final payment will not be made by the purveyor, until the written program plan has been reviewed and a ccepted by DOH. Q. What does “coordination” with Local Administrative Auth ority (LAA) mean? A. Coordination is explained in detail in Chapter 6. Coordination may ra nge from a minimal effort, i.e., an exchange of in formation with the LAA, to an extensive level of coordination, i.e., implementation of a joint program. The advantages and disadvantages of the range of levels of coordination are disc ussed in Chapter 6. Purveyors must desc ribe the level of coordination in their wr itten CCC program pl ans. When a joint prog ram is selected as the preferred option, although not required, DOH reco mmends that a written agreement be developed between the purveyor and the LAA.

--- Page 156 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 Note: Efforts are currently underway in Snohomish Coun ty to develop standardized language to use when developing wr itten coordination agreements between purveyors and LAAs in Washington. Pur veyors are encouraged to stay informed about this effort through their regional CCC groups. Once de veloped, DOH hopes to incorporate the sample ag reement language into a futu re update of this manual. Q. Must a Cross-Connection Control progra m be submitted to Washington State Department of Health (DOH) for review? A. Yes, per WAC246-290-490(2)(e), it was DOH’s intent for written program plans to be included in the purveyor’s Water System Pl an (WSP) or Small Wate r System Management Program (SWSMP) that are subm itted to DOH for review and approval. Ho wever, not all Group A systems must su bmit WSPs or SWSMPs. For exam ple, small, non-expanding water systems are not required to subm it planning documents, unless specifically reque sted to do so by DOH due to system operational problems . DOH also intended to be able to request submission of the purveyor’s written CCC program pl an as a stand-alone document or to request that the plan be made available for revi ew as part of the sanitary survey process. Q. Can a purveyor rely so lely upon a premises isolation program or rely solely upon an in-premises program to protect the public water system (PWS) from contamination? A. Purveyors may rely solely upon premises isolation programs to protect their systems from contamination. However, the opposite is not tr ue. Thus, purveyors can’t rely solely upon in-premises programs to protect the PWS from contamination. An in-premises type of program is unacceptable, because the CCC regula tions require all purveyors to ensure that premises isolation is provided for high health hazard categories of premises of the type listed in Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490. Systems do have the option of implementing a co mbination program that relies on premises isolation for high-hazard premises and relies on in-premises protection for non-high hazard premises. When the purveyor chooses this co mbination program optio n, all conditions in WAC 246-290-490(2)( h) must be met. Q. Are purveyors required to shut-off or deny water service to cust omers that fail to comply with the purvey or's cross-connection control requirements? A. No, water shut-off is only one of the en forcement tools available to purveyors. The responsibility of the purveyor is to protect the PWS from cont amination. Wa ter shut-off may be appropriate under emergency conditions (e.g., backflow incide nt occurring, cross connection with sewage). Howe ver, in lieu of water shutoff, the purveyor may choose to install the necessary back flow preventer, if the cu stomer fails to comply with the request to install a backflow preventer.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 Shutting off water service may caus e a public health haz ard. In addition, shutting off water service without reasonable cause or adequate le gal authority may expos e the purveyor to a claim for damages. DOH is in the process of developing guidance to purveyors regarding water shutoff. Once finalized , DOH plans to include the guid ance material in this manual. Q. Why is it necessary to noti fy the Local Administrative Authority (LAA), before I shut off a customer’s water? A. This requirement is in the regulations, because the purveyor’s actions may affect the public health and safety of occupants and/or users of the customer's premises. For example, the shut off of potable water service affects bu ilding occupancy, addin g a double-check valve assembly (DCVA) on the serv ice affects thermal expansion, and the s hutoff of a fire line affects public safety. For lia bility management, th e purveyor should no t take any action known to affect public health or safety wi thout notifying the LAA having jurisdiction. Q. Why is it necessary to p revent the intentional return of water to the distribution system (e.g., from heat exchangers)? A. In a PWS, the normal flow of water is from the source of supply to the customer’s tap. Thus, many contaminants introduced into the customer’s plumbing system by the customer (through backflow incidents, inadequat e disinfection of repair work, etc.) will likely remain in the customer's system, until the customer’s normal use flushes the contaminants from a tap. However, a return system circumvents this natural protection for the PWS. More importantly, the purveyor has no control over the quality of water that has left the purveyor's distribution system. Even when the returned water is supposedly potable, a change in temperature may adversely affect the purveyor's system (e.g., increased water temperature may enhance bacteria re-growth in the distribution system). Prohibiting the intentional return of used water to the pur veyor’s distribution system protects the quality of water served to consumers.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 Section 3 Minimum Elements of a Cr oss-Connection Control (CCC) Program Q. Do the regulations specify when purveyors need to co mplete their initial hazard assessments? A. The regulations do not specify an absolute time frame for comp leting initial hazard assessments. Chapter 7 of this manual includes general schedule guidelines. The revised CCC regulations beca me effective in April 1999. As of the publication date of this manual, all Group A systems should have at least initiated their CCC programs. At a minimum, DOH will revi ew the purveyor’s written progra m plan when a system submits a WSP or SWSMP. The written program plan must include procedures and reasonable schedules for ensuring completion of initia l hazard assessments for existing and new customers. For example, a plan may indicate for existing customers that the init ial hazard evaluations will be completed within one year of progra m startup. For new co nnections, the purveyor should now be making initial ha zard evaluations prior to se rvice being prov ided. As a practical matter, the purveyor will need to first estab lish a CCC policy, reta in the services of a CCS, etc. before assessing hazards. Purveyors will show DOH their system’s impl ementation progress th rough submi ssion of the Annual Summary Report (ASR) forms, and/or through sa nitary surveys. Q. When must the purveyor start inst alling backflow prevention assemblies? A. The CCC regulations do not establish an absolu te time frame. Howeve r, Chapter 7 of this manual includes genera l guidelines. The purveyor's writte n program plan must establish procedures and schedules for ba ckflow preventer installation. The time allowed should be based on the degree of hazard posed to the PWS. For example, a plan may specify that all customers of the type listed on Table 9 of WA C 246-290-490 w ill have backflow prevention installed within two years of notification and that all low-ha zard fire lines will have backflow prevention installed when the building is renovate d or enlarged. Q. What is an acceptable time fram e for submission of a test report? A. A reasonable time frame for a backflow assembly tester (BAT) to provide the customer with a test report is within ten bus iness days of performing the test . In general, for the annual backflow assembly test report, most purveyors allow customers 30 to 45 days to submit the paperwork from the anni versary date. In rura l areas, where only a few BATs are available, purveyors may need to allow a longer period (e.g., 45-60 days). Purveyors need to make sure their customer’s receive notice for the test long before the annive rsary date. Purveyors should not send out the te sting notices at the la st minute and expect their customers to rush to comply.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 Note: The annual test doesn’t need to be completed on the precise anniversary date of the last test. Most purveyors consider a timefram e within thirty days of the anniversary date reasonable for the annual test to be performed. Q. What is the purpose of the quality assurance/qualit y control (QA/QC) program? A. The purpose of the QA/QC progra m is to ensure consistency a nd reliability in the testing of assemblies that pr otect the PWS. Although not fail-proof, th e quality assurance program should help prevent and/or reduce some of the problems purveyors have encountered in the past with BAT performance. These problems have included submission of incomplete or false test reports, use of incorrect test procedures, and testing errors made due to improperly calibrate d test equipment. Also , the additional hands-on training ti me in BAT courses and tightening of th e DOH BAT certificatio n exam process sh ould help improve BAT performance statewide. Section 4 Approved Backfl ow Preventer Selection Q. Are purveyors limited to the categories in Table 9 of Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 246-290-490 for mandatory prem ises isolation? A. No. Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 is not all-incl usive, and in fact, on ly identifies typical high-hazard categories of premises served by most large PWSs in Washington. Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 is essentially the minimum list of categories that require premises isolation. Other states and technical references may includ e additional cate gories in their mandatory premises isolation lists. Purveyors must ensure that all premises of the type listed on Tabl e 9 of WAC 246-290-490 meet the mandatory premises isolation require ments. Although purveyors may not delete a mandatory isolation category fr om Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490, they may add to the Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 list. Additions may be based on industry guidance and the purveyor’s polic y for risk and liability management. For example, airl ine manufacturing plants are not specifically listed on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490, but must be considered as high hazard premises for the few PWSs in Washington that provide wate r service to them. As anothe r example, for risk and liability management, a purveyor may choose to requ ire premises isolation DCVAs on all malls, because of the complexity of th eir piping systems and high pr obability of changes in tenants (i.e., water use).

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 Q. Some of the categories on Table 9 of Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 246- 290-490 are confusing. For example, are gas stations included in the Petroleum Storage and Processing category? Are rest aurants included in the Food Processing Plant category? A. The intent of Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 is to identify typical ca tegories of fa cilities that pose a high health hazard to the PWS. This rating is due to on e or more of the following: the complexity of their plumbing and industrial piping system s, frequency of plumbing and piping changes, scale of op erations (large, commercial), the presence of hazardous materials, and/or hazardous processes/activities occurring on-site. DOH intended for the category Petroleum Storage and Proces sing facilities to address bulk storage facilities (i .e., tank farms) and refi neries; DOH did no t intend for this category to include neighborhood gas stations. Similarly, DOH intended for the Food Pr ocessing Plant category to address canneries, beef packing houses , potato processors, fruit processors, etc., and in general did not intend for th e category to includ e local restaurants. Q. Which irrigation systems require premises isolation? A. The UPC establishes backflow protection requirements for irrigation systems in Washington. However, th e UPC does not cover dedicated irrigation systems supplied directly from the purveyor’s distribution ma in (i.e., not supplie d through customer’s domestic service line). Under Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490, irrigation systems with chemical addition that are suppl ied through a dedicated line (i.e., separate from the domestic service line) require premises is olation with a reduced-pressure backflow assembly (RPBA). Dedicated irrigation lines are ty pically found at parks, playgrounds, golf courses, cemeteries, and estates. The UPC requires an RPBA on other irrigatio n systems with chemical addition. For irrigation systems without chem ical addition, the UPC requir es a DCVA, pressure vacuum breaker assembly (PVBA) or atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB). The pu rveyor’s written program plan should ad dress irrigation systems and indicate whether: • AVBs will be accepted to protect the PWS; or • An approved assembly (e.g., a testable DCVA) will be required.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 Q. Is there a provision in the Washington Ad ministrative Code (W AC) for the purveyor to grant an exception to th e mandatory premises isolatio n requirements for premises of the type listed on Ta ble 9 of WAC 246-290-490? A. Yes, the WAC does contain such a provision. The exception prov ision is to be used in those rare instances where the cust omer's water use and hazard posed to the purveyor’s system don’t “match” the water use and high health ha zard typically associated with the specific category of premises. For ex ample, a “beverage bottling plant” used only as a storage warehouse doesn’t pose the sa me degree of hazard as a pl ant where beverage bottling processes are taking place. The purveyor's CCS must assess the degree of hazard and determine whether the granting of an exception is appropria te. CCSs can use the "good engineering practices” described in the techni cal publications refere nced in WAC 246-290- 490(2) to aid in excep tion determinations . When exceptions to mandatory premises isolation are granted , the CCS must document the reasons, i.e., provide justification for gr anting the exception. DOH has developed an Exception Form for do cumenting the justifica tion for granting an excep tion. An Exception Form must be completed for each exception grant ed by the purveyor. After the initial ASR is completed and submitted to DOH, Exception Forms must be submitted to DOH with the ASR for the reporting year in wh ich the exception was granted. Q. As an "alternate location acceptable to the purveyor ,” how far downstream of the meter may a premises isolat ion assembly be located? A. There is no general rule in te rms of distance. How ever, for risk management reasons, it is preferable that the assembly be located as cl ose to the meter (propert y line) as possible and that no connections are made between the meter and the RPBA. For freeze protection, many pur veyors allow the RPBA to be installed in the mechanical room of the building or at the point where the service line just enters the building. Because the RPBA must isolate the customer’s plumbing from the PWS, there can be no connections made between the RPBA and the meter, unles s they are specifically approved by the purveyor and have the appropri ate backflow protection. Q. Must backflow protection fo r all existing fire sprinkler sy stems with chemical addition be upgraded to a reduced-pressure backfl ow assembly (RPBA) within 90 days of notifying the customer of the high health cross-connection hazard? A. No. The WAC allows an alternate schedule acce ptable to the purveyor to be adopted. The 90 days indicates the high health hazard assessment of fire sp rinkler systems with chemical addition and the need to gi ve priority to the in stallation of an RPBA.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 The purveyor should work with the customer to est ablish a reasonable schedule for installation of the backflow prev enter. However, for risk ma nagement reasons, the earliest possible installation date provides the most benefit to the purveyor. When working with customers to establish a mutu ally agreeable schedule, pu rveyors should consider the practical aspects of retrofitting an existing sprinkler system with the appropriate backflow protection (e.g., cost, obtaining permits, im pacts on sprinkler performance, possible redesign of fire system, space limitations and scheduling a contractor). In some situations, the customer may need as long as two years to get the backflow preventer installed (e.g., hospital). Note: The RPBA requirement for high-haz ard fire sprinkler systems should be imposed when the customer remodels or expands the building. Q. How can the customer obtain water to test plumbing, before backflow preventers are installed and tested? A. Normal practice is to provide a constructio n service with a wate r meter and an RPBA (DCVA minimum). A construction site often po ses a greater cross-conne ction hazard to the PWS than the completed facility. Section 5 Approved Ba ckflow Preventers Q. Where do I obtain a cur rent list of Washington State Department of Health (DOH) approved assemblies? A. Purveyors may obtain hard copies of the list from DOH Office of Drinking Water upon request. The Training and Outreach Sectio n handles such requests. Purveyors without Internet access can request the list by e-mail or by phone (see Appendix F for DOH contact information). Purveyors with Internet access can request a list via the Drinking Water website: http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/dw Due to our agreement with US C (the organization that deve lops the list), DOH is not allowed to post the list on th e Drinking Water website. DOH publishes the list annually (at the beginning of each calendar year) and issu es at least one update during the year. DOH automatically sends updates to those systems, CCSs, BATs, etc., on file with DOH as having requested a list at the beginning of the calendar year. The purveyor’s CCS sh ould have a copy of the most recently published DOH-Approved Assemblies List and unde rstand how to use the information on the list.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 Section 6 Approved Backflow Preventer Installation Q. What are the requirem ents for installation? A. The standard installation procedures accep table to DOH are provided in the technical publications such as the USC Manual or Pacific Northwes t Section – American Water Works Association (PNWS-AW WA) Manual. Larg e utilities and/or th e regional cross- connection groups may also have standard in stallation plan s available that meet the technical specifications in th e CCC manuals and can be used by small water systems. Q. Can a double-check val ve assembly (DCVA) be installed in a below- ground pit? What about the requirement that the purveyor en sure that an assembly is not flooded? A. Yes, a DCVA can be installed below grade (e.g., in a meter bo x). The intent of the language regarding flooding was to prev ent backflow assemblies from creating cross-connection hazards themselves. To meet the intent of the WAC, with a below-grade type of installation, the purveyor must ensure that the assembly will not create a cross connectio n with ground water. This can be ac complished by requiring test cock plug s to be installed with all below- grade assemblies. Section 7 Approved Backflow Pr eventer Inspection and Testing Q. Must a cross-connection control special ist (CCS) inspect an atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) on a residential lawn sprinkler system? A. Yes. All AVBs relied upon by the purveyor must inspected by a CCS at the time of installation, after a ba ckflow incident and afte r repair, re-installation and re-inspection. The purpose of the inspection is to make sure the AVB is installed correctly and is operable, etc. The USC foundation recommends that AVBs be checked annually. Q. Annual assembly testing is a Washington State Depa rtment of Health (DOH) minimum requirement. When would it be ap propriate for a purveyor to require more testing? A. More frequent testing is app ropriate when an assembly s hows (from the historical test reports) signs of impending failure, but the asse mbly has not been replac ed. For example, if there is a question about the reliability of the assembly, the purvey or should require another test in six months. In addition, some purvey ors require more frequent testing for premises isolation assemblies installed at severe and high-hazard facilities such as nuclear facilities, sewage treatment plants, and hospitals.

________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 Section 8 Recordk eeping and Reporting Q. What documentat ion must be kept? A. For each connection served , the purveyor must keep: • Information on the initial and subsequent hazard assessments (e .g., questionnaire and survey); and • Detailed assembly inventory information for all assemb lies relied upon by the purveyor to protect the PWS. Actual test report readings should be recorded and kept as part of the required assemb ly test report information. For connections with both a premises isolat ion assembly and one or more in-premises assemblies, the purveyor is only required to track information on the premises isolation assembly. All assemblies othe r than the premises isolat ion assembly fall under the jurisdiction of the Loca l Administrative Authority. Q. When should records of test reports be kept in electronic format (i.e., other than manually)? A. The WAC allows records to be kept manually on paper or in elect ronic format, so the decision is left to th e purveyor. Most systems find t hat manual tracking becomes too difficult, when the number of assemblies that pr otect the PWS reache s 100 or more. Because they will have so few a ssemblies to track, many sma ll water systems may be able to keep adequate records manually. However, where a personal computer is used for word processing, it is a relatively easy task to es tablish a computer spre adsheet to track test reports. Most small system s will not need to purchase more expe nsive, proprietary computer database software specifically de signed for CCC prog ram management.

--- Page 165 ---
________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Chapter 8 Q. Must all backflow incide nts be reported to DOH? A. Yes. Purveyors must notify DOH, the local administrative authority, and the local health jurisdiction as soon as possible and no late r than the next busine ss day of any backflow incident that contaminates the PWS or cust omer’s plumbing. Purv eyors can consult the PNWS-AWWA Backflow Incident Investigation Ma nual for information on how to proceed with investigatio n and clean up. The purveyor must document (o n a form acceptable to DOH) the details of any incidents that contaminated the PWS. However, for risk management purposes, it is prudent for purveyors to report all known backflow incidents to DOH, in cluding incidents where the contaminant was contained within the customer ’s premises. This additional information can be helpful when DOH is coordinating with the State Bu ilding Code Council on UPC issues and for demonstrating the effectiveness of premises isolation for protection of the PWS.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix A Appendix A Example Cross-Connectio n Control Program and Legal Instrument for a Community System Contents This appendix contains an example written cro ss-connection control (CCC) program plan and an example legal instrument for a community system. The legal instrument establishes the authority of a public water system (PWS) to adopt and implement a CCC program. The primary type of program that these documents address is a premises isolation type of pro- gram. However, alternate wordi ng or passages are included for combination or joint types of programs. Other commonly used alternate appr oaches and optional add itional requirements are also included where appropriate. How to Use Appendix A The example program and legal instrument in Appendix A have been designed for use by com- munity systems where the majority of the servic e connections are residences or premises owned or occupied by private or public en tities separate from the purveyor. The documents in this appendix have been arra nged and formatted for ease of review by the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) when it evaluates the program with respect to the regulations. Therefore, DOH recommends that purveyors follow the fo rmat (i.e., use the ex- ample program as a template) whenever possible. However, PWSs are not required to use the example program and legal instrument. DOH recognizes that some PWSs may have a particular approach or institutional requireme nts that may dictate a different format or wording in the writ- ten program plan. Instructions To use the example program plan, water systems are encouraged to: Download the example program file (in Micr osoft Word format) from the web site or ob- tain from DOH electronically; Retain the basic formatting and text of the example program and fill in the blanks, deci- sion table, and check boxes where indicated to “customize” the example program; Include or delete optional and/or additional language shown in the example program to reflect system-specific decisions; and Insert the completed written CCC program pl an in the Small Water System Management Program (SWSMP) or Water System Plan (WSP).

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix A Cross-Connection Control Program Plan for _________________ Water System A. Requirement for Program {Insert public water system name}, {insert public water system identification number }, hereinafter referred to as “the Pu rveyor”, has the respon sibility to protect th e public water system from contamination due to cr oss connections. A cross co nnection may be defined as “any actual or potential physical connection between a potable water line and any pipe, vessel, or machine that contains or has a pr obability of containing a non-potable gas or liquid, such that it is possible for a non-potable gas or liquid to enter th e potable water system by backflow.” All public water system s are required to develop and impl ement cross-connection control (CCC) programs. The CCC requirements are contained in Washington Administra tive Code (WAC) 246- 290-490 of the Group A Drinking Water Re gulations. The minimum re quired elements of a CCC program are: Establishment of legal authority and program policies; Evaluation of premises for cross-connection hazards; Elimination and/or cont rol of cross connections; Provision of qualified personnel; 5. Inspection and testing of backflow preventers; Quality control of testing process; Response to backflow incidents; Public education for consumers; Record keeping for CCC program; and 10. Special requirements for reclaimed water use. Other CCC program requirements include: Coordination with the Local Administrative Author ity (LAA), i.e., th e local building or plumbing official regarding CCC activities; Prohibition of the return of used water into th e public water system (PWS) distribution system; and Inclusion of a written CCC program in a Water System Plan (W SP) or a Small Water System Management Program (SWSMP). Note: Throughout the example CCC program plan the term customer is used. Customer as used herein means the property owner and/or occupant of the premises served by the PWS (i.e., whoever interfaces with the PWS regarding water service). Also, unless otherwise defined, all CCC-related terms used in this example program ha ve the same definitions as those contained in WAC 246-290-010 of the Washington St ate Drinking Water Regulations.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix A D. Required Elements of Program The drinking water regulations for Group A public water systems in Wash ington, WAC 246-290, require CCC programs to in clude certain minimum el ements. The elements are listed in WAC 246- 290-490(3). This section describe s how the water system intends to comply with each of the required program elements. Elements are numbe red the same as they appear in the WAC. Element 1: Adoption of a written legal instrume nt authorizing the establishment and implementation of a CCC program. The {Insert PWS name} water system has adopted a reso lution (Resolution No. _________), reproduced as Exhibit _____, whic h authorizes the Purveyor to implement a CCC program. The resolution also authorizes the sy stem to terminate water service to consumers who do not comply with the resolution. Ho wever, the primary method for protection of the di stribution syst em will be the installation of a backflow preventer by the customer, at the cu stomer’s expense. [Optional approach : “by the water system, and the cost thereof to be billed to the customer.” (see Decision Table Items 6 and 9) ] (The Purveyor can substitute appr opriate wording to reflect alternate decisions made by the PWS.) The attached service contract refe rred to in the resolutio n shall be the primary enforcement authority for all new customers. For customers supplied prior to the adoption of the attached resolution, an implied service contract allows the Purveyor to protect the distribution system from contaminat ion through a Purveyor- installed backflow preventer on a customer's service. The written and implied cont ract terms are di scussed further under Element 3. (The Purveyor should complete and include the following schedule for adoption of a legal instrument, if not already adopted: Legal Instrument Status Schedule Preparation of proposed legal instrument Introduction of the legal instrument to governing body Adoption of legal instrument Legal instrument becomes effective Schedules may vary depending on governing body procedures. )

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix A Element 2: Development and implementa tion of procedures and schedules for evaluating new and existing service connections to assess the degree of hazard. Initial Cross-Connect ion Hazard Surveys The procedures for evalua ting the backflow prevention requirem ents for new and existing customers are as follows: For all new non-residential services , the Purveyor will require that the customer submit with the application for water service an evalua tion (performed at cust omer’s expense) by a DOH-certified cross-connection control speci alist (CCS) of the hazard posed by the proposed plumbing system, with recommendations for the insta llation at the me ter of either a double-check valve as sembly (DCVA) or a reduced-press ure principle backflow assembly (RPBA). [Combination or Joint Program Alternative: “or commensurate in-premises backflow protection.” ] The Purveyor may accept the recommendati ons or submit the recommendations to a CCS employed by the PWS for peer review and concurrence, before acceptance. As an alternative to the above requirement fo r a survey by a CCS, th e customer may agree to install an approved air gap (AG) or RPBA for premises is olation as a condition of service. For all new residential services , the Purveyor will require that the customer submit with the application for water service a completed “Wat er Use Questionnaire” (copy shown on page {PWS insert page number here} ). If the customer's ques tionnaire indicates special plumbing, such as a lawn sp rinkler system, or hazardous water use on the premises, the customer shall subm it to the Purveyor an evaluation by a DOH-certified CCS of the hazard posed by the proposed special plumbing system, with recomm endations for th e installation at the meter of either a DCVA or an RPBA. [Combination or Joint Program Alternative: “or commensurate in-premises protection.” ] As an alternative to the above requirement for a survey by a DOH-certified CCS, the Purveyor, at his/her discretion, may specify the backflow preventer required to be installed as a condition of service. For all existing non-residential services , the Purveyor will require the custom er to submit to the Purveyor, within nine months of notificat ion, an evaluation by a DOH-certified CCS, of the hazard posed by the plumbi ng system, with recommendations for the installation at the meter of either a DCVA or an RPBA. [Combination or Joint Program Alternative: “or commensurate in-premise s backflow preventers.” ] The Purveyor may accept the recommendations or submit th e recommendations to a CCS em ployed by the Purveyor for peer review and concurrenc e, before acceptance. As an alternative to the above requirement for a survey by a DOH-certified CCS, the customer may agree to install an AG or RPBA for premises is olation within 90 days of notification by the Purveyor or an alternat e time period acceptable to the Purveyor.

--- Page 174 ---
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix A 4. For all existing reside ntial services , the Purveyor will require th e customer to submit to the Purveyor, within four months of notification, a co mpleted “Water Use Questionnaire.” If the customer's reply indicates special plumbing or water use on the premises, the customer shall submit an evaluati on by a DOH-certified CCS of the hazard posed to the water system by the customer’s plumbing system, with reco mmendations for the inst allation at the meter of either a DCVA or an RPBA. [Combination or Joint Pr ogram Alternative: “ or commensurate in-premise s backflow preventers”. ] As an alternative to the above requirement fo r a survey by a CCS, th e Purveyor may specify the backflow preventer required to be installed as a condition of service. The Purveyor’s CCS will provide guidance on the type of backflow preventer to be installed. For all existing servic es, should the customer fail to supply the requ ired information for a hazard assessment or fail to s ubmit a completed “W ater Use Questionnaire,” the Purveyor may have the assessment made by a CCS employe d by the Purveyor, re quire the installation of an RPBA for premises isolatio n, or take other such actions consistent with the previously stated policies and bill the cust omer for the associated costs. Cross-Connection Hazard Su rvey Schedule for Initial Hazard Assessments The schedule for initial hazard assessm ent is outlined in the following table. The schedule starts from the date the CCC progr am is established. Initial Assessment Task Schedule Assessment of all new connections At time of application for water service Identification and assessment of high-hazard premises which are listed on Table 9 of Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 246-290-490 Within nine months Identification and assessmen t of hazardous premises supplemental to Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 Within 12 months Identification of residential connections with special plumbing facilities and/or wa ter use on th e premises Within 15 months Cross-Connection Hazard Surv ey Schedule for Subsequent Hazard Re-Assessments For subsequent cross-connection hazard surveys, pr ocedures for evaluating the backflow prevention requirements are: For residential services, the Purveyor will requir e the customer to subm it to the Purveyor, within two months of purveyor notification, a completed “Water Use Questionnaire.” The procedure used for evaluating the hazard re-assessment and the potential change in the required backflow prevention will be the same as used for the initial hazard assessment.

--- Page 175 ---
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix A 2. For all non-residential services , the Purveyor will require th e customer to submit to the Purveyor, within two months of purveyor notification, a hazard re-assessment (at the customer’s expense) by a DOH-certified CCS. The frequency of hazard re-assessments will be as shown in the table below: Type of Service Frequency of Re-Evaluation Any services with reduced-pressure principle backflow assembly (RPBA) installed for premises isolation None required as long as the RPBA passes annual tests and inspections Commercial services with do uble-check va lve assembly (DCVA) installed for premises isolation Every two years and upon change in use or ownership [Combination or Join t Program Alternative : Commercial services when purveyor relie s upon in-premises protection ] Every two years and upon change in use, ownership, or plumbing system Residential services with special plumbing where the purveyor relies upon complia nce with Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) Every 2-3 years (questionnaire) Residential services with DCVA installed for premises isolation Every 4-5 years (questionnaire) Residential services with no known special plumbing or water use on the premises Every 4-5 years and upon change in use, ownership, or plumbing system (questionnaire) The Purveyor will info rm the customer that the Pu rveyor's survey of a cust omer's premises (whether by a representative of the Purveyor or through the evaluation of a questionnaire completed by the customer) is for the sole purpose of establishi ng the Purveyor's mini mum requireme nts for the protection of the public water su pply system, and that the require d backflow prot ection will be commensurate with the Purv eyor's assessment of th e degree of hazard. The Purveyor will also in form the customer or any regulator y agencies that the Purveyor's survey, requirements for the installation of backflow prev ention assemblies, lack of requirements for the installation of backflow preventio n assemblies, or other actions by the purveyor’s personnel or agent do not constitute an approval of the custom er's plumbing system or an assurance to the customer or any regulatory agency of the absence of cross connections.

Backflow Preventer Requirements The following service policy shall apply to all new and existing customers: The Purveyor w ill require that wate r service to all non-residential customers be isolated at the meter by a DOH-approved DCVA or RPBA acceptable to the Purveyor. All high- hazard connections of th e type described in Ta ble 9 of WAC 246-290-49 0 shall be isolated with an RPBA. [Recommended Option: “ All other non-residentia l customers shall be isolated with a DCVA.” ] [Optional Combination or Joint Program Alternative: “In lieu of isolation with a DCVA, other non-residential customers, with the co ncurrence of the Purvey or’s CCS, may install in-premises protection commensurate with the degree of hazard, as determined by the Purveyor’s CCS.” ] The Purveyor will require all residential customers with facilities of th e type described in Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 to be isolated with an RPBA. All other residential customers with special plumbing or water use on the premises will be isol ated with a DCVA. “Special plumbing” includes, but is no t limited to, th e following: a. A lawn irrigation system; b. A solar heating system; c. An auxiliary source of su pply, e.g., a we ll or creek; d. Piping for livestock wate ring, hobby farming, etc.; e. Residential fire sprinkler system; and f. Property containing a small boat moorage. [Optional addition: “Additio nal premises requirin g premises isolation. The Purveyor has chosen to supplement Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490(4) by iden tifying additional premises or premises types for whic h premises isolation is mandated . Such premises will include aircraft and automotive manufacturers, pulp and paper mills, military ba ses, tall buildings, premises with complex plumbing, premises wi th plumbing subject to frequent changes, plumbing with a repeat history of cross-conne ctions being established or reestablished, premises with public swimming pools, an d {Purveyor should add other premises or premises types}.” ] [Optional addition: “All remaining residential customers will be isolated at the meter by a purveyor-installed meter check valve (single or dual).” ] [Combination or Joint Program Alternative: “ Residential customers not re quired to be isolated wi th an RPBA may install in-premises protection in accordance with th e Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) in lieu of isolation with a DCVA.” ]

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix A 5. For all customers that have a writte n service contract with the Purveyor , the required premises isolation DC VA or RPBA shall be: • Purchased and installed by the customer (a t the customer's expense) immediately downstream of the water meter in accordanc e with the Purveyor's standards described hereinafter; and • Maintained, tested, and inspect ed in accordance with the Pu rveyor's standards described hereinafter. For new customers, the Purveyor will not turn on water (except for testing purposes) at the meter until the customer complies with the above requirements. The failure of the customer to comply with the Purveyor’s insta llation and maintenance requirements shall constitute a breach of contr act by the customer. The Purveyor may then proceed with corrective action provis ions stipulated in the contract. Customers without written contracts are considered to have an implied contract that requires the customer to bear all reasonable cost s of service. The Pu rveyor will install the required DCVA or RPBA on the service, upstrea m of the meter, and charge the customer for the cost of the initial inst allation, and all future maintena nce, testing, and repair, as set forth in the Purveyor's schedule of rates and ch arges. The failure of the customer to pay these costs shall constitute a breach of contract by the customer, and the Purveyor will proceed with the established delinquency of pa yment procedures. As an alternative, the customer may sign a service contract and install the required backflow preventer downstream of the meter in accordance with the Purveyor’s installation standards described hereinafter. Approved Backflow Preventers and Installation All backflow preventers relied up on by the Purveyor to protect the public water system shall meet the definition of “approved backflow preventer” as c ontained in WAC 246-290-010. The Purveyor will obtain and maintain a current list of assemblies a pproved for installation in Washington State from the DOH Office of Drinking Water. All backflow preventers will be installed in: • The orientation for which they are approved; • A manner and location that fa cilitates their proper operation, maintenance, a nd testing or inspection; • A manner that w ill protect them from we ather-related conditions such as flooding and freezing; and • Compliance with applicable safety regulations.

[Optional Alternative: “Installation shall conform to stand ard construction draw ings and specifications of the Purveyor.” ] The Purveyor has no regulato ry responsibilit y or authority over the installation and operation of the customer's plumbing system. The customer is so lely responsible for compliance with all applicable regulations and for prevention of contamination of his plumbing system from sources within his/he r premises. Any action taken by the Purveyor to survey plumbing, inspect or test backflow prevention assemb lies, or to require premises isolation (installation of DCVA or RPBA on service) is solely for the purpos es of reducing the risk of contamination of th e Purveyor's distribution system. The Purveyor will inform the customer that any action take n by the Purveyor shall not be construed by the customer as guidance on the safety or reliability of the customer’s plumbing system. The Purveyor will not provide advice to th e customer on the design and installation of plumbing other than through th e general public education program discussed in Element 8. Except for easements containing the Purveyor's distribution system, the Purveyor will not undertake work on the customer's premises. Schedule for Installation of Backflow Preventers The following table shows the schedule that the Purveyor will follow for installation of backflow preventers when they are requi red (based on the ha zard evaluation).

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix A Resolution No. ________ Cross-Connection Control Policy Finding of Fact Whereas it is the responsibility of a wa ter purveyor to provide water to the cu stomer at the meter that meets Washington stat e water quality standards; Whereas it is the water purveyo r's responsibility to prev ent the contamination of the public water system from the source of supply (i.e., to the customer's connectio n to the service pipe or meter); Whereas it is a requiremen t of the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) for the Purveyor to establish a cross connection-cont rol program satisfactory to DOH; Whereas cross-connections within the customer's plumbing system po se a potential source for the contamination of the publ ic water supply system; Now be it resolved that the {Insert PWS name} , hereinafter referred to as the Purveyor, establishes the following service policy to protect the purv eyor-owned water system from the risk of contamination. For public health and safety, this policy shall apply equally to all new and existing customers. Definitions Unless otherwise defined, all terms used in this resolution pertaining to cross-connection control have the same definitions as those contained in WAC 246-290-010 of the Washington State Drinking Water Regulations. Prevention of Contamination The customer's plumbing system, starting from the termination of th e Purveyor's water service pipe, shall be considered a potential high-health hazard requiring the isolation of the customer's premises by a DOH-approved, customer-installed and mainta ined reduced-pressure principle backflow assembly (RPBA) or reduced-pressure detector assembly (RPDA). The RPBA or RPDA shall be located at the end of the Purveyor 's water service pipe (i.e., imme diately downstream of the meter). Water shall only be supplied to the customer through a DOH-approved, customer-installed and maintained RPBA or RPDA. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, th e Purveyor, upon an assessment of the risk of contamination posed by the customer's plumbing system and use of water, may allow: • A single-family or duplex reside ntial customer to c onnect directly to th e water service pipe, i.e., without a purveyor-a pproved DCVA or RPBA.

--- Page 191 ---

These measures shall include the prevention of backflow under any backpressu re or backsiphonage condition, including the disruption of the water supply from the Purvey or's system that may occur during routine system maintenance or during emergency co nditions, such as a water main break. The customer agrees to install, operate, an d maintain at all times his plumbing system in compliance with the current editi on of the Uniform Plumbing Co de having jurisdiction as it pertains to the prevention of contamination an d protection from therma l expansion, due to a closed system that could occur with the present or future installation of backflow preventers on the customer's service and/ or at plumbing fixtures. For cross-connection control or other public health-related surv eys, the customer agrees to provide for the Purveyor’s employees or agents free access to all parts of the premises during reasonable work ing hours of the day for routine surveys and at all times during emergencies. Where agreement for free acces s for the Purveyor's survey is denied, the Purveyor may supply water service provided that premises isolation is pr ovided through a DOH- approved reduced-pressure principle b ackflow assemb ly (RPBA). The customer agrees to inst all all backflow prevention asse mblies requested by the Purveyor and to maintain those assemblies in good workin g order. The assemblies shall be of a type, size, and make approved by DOH and acceptable to th e Purveyor. The a ssemblies shall be installed in accordance with the recommendations given in the most recently published edition of the Cross Connection Contro l Manual, Accepted Procedures and Practice, published by the Pacific Northwes t Section, American Water Wo rks Association, or latest edition thereof. [Optional Wording: “The assemblies shall be installed in accordance with the Purveyor’s construction standards and specifications.” ] The customer agrees to:

The customer agrees to bear all costs for the aforementioned insta llation, testing, repair, maintenance and replacement of the RPBA, RPDA, DCVA or DCDA installed to protect the Purveyor's distribution system. At the time of application for service, if required by the Purveyor, the customer agrees to submit to the Purveyor plumbing plans and/or a cross-connection control survey of the premises conducted by a purveyor-approved and DOH-certified Cross-Connection Con- trol Specialist (CCS). The cross-connection control surv ey shall assess the cross-connection hazards and list the backflow preventers provided within the premises. The results of the survey shall be submitted prior to the Purveyor turning on wate r service to a new customer. The cost of the survey shall be borne by the customer. For classes of customers other than single-family resi dential, when required by the Purveyor, the customer agrees to periodically su bmit a cross-connection control re-survey of the premises by a DOH-certified CCS acceptab le to the Purveyor. The Purveyor may require the re-survey to be performed in respon se to changes in the cu stomer's plumbing or water use, or performed periodically (annua lly or less frequently) where the Purveyor considers the customer's plumbing system to be complex or subject to frequent changes in water use. The cost of the re-surve y shall be borne by the customer. Within 30 days of a request by the Purveyor, a residentia l customer shall agree to complete and submit to the Purveyor a "Water Use Questionnaire" for the purpose of surveying the health hazard posed by the cu stomer's plumbing system on the Purveyor's distribution system. Further, the residential customer agre es to provide within 30 days of a request by the Purveyor a cross-connectio n control survey of the prem ises by a DOH-certified CCS acceptable to the Purveyor. The customer agrees to obtain the prior appr oval from the Purveyor fo r all changes in water use, and alterations and additions to the pl umbing system, and sh all comply with any additional requirements imposed by the Pu rveyor for cross-connection control. The customer agrees to immediately notify the Purveyor and the local health jurisdiction of

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix A any backflow incident occurri ng within the customer’s pr emises (i.e., entry of any contaminant/pollutant into the drinking water) an d shall cooperate fully with the Purveyor to determine the reason for the backflow incident. The customer acknowledges th e right of the Purveyor to disc ontinue the water supply within 72 hours of giving notice to the customer, or a lesser period of time if required to protect public health, if the customer fails to cooperate with the Purveyor in the survey of premises, in the installation, maintenance, repair, insp ection, or testing of backflow prevention assemblies or air gaps required by the Purveyor , or in the Purveyor's effort to contain a contaminant or pollutant that is de tected in the cust omer's system. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in lieu of di scontinuing water service, the Purveyor may install an RPBA on the servic e pipe to provide premises isolation, and recover all costs for the instal lation and subsequent maintenan ce and repair of the assembly, appurtenances, and enclosure from the customer as fees and charges for water. The failure of the customer to pay these fe es and charges may result in termination of water service in accordance with the Purveyor 's water billing policies. [Add for Combination or Joint Program: “ The Purveyor will requir e premises is olation for a customer that is of the high-hazard type or category requiring "Mandatory Premises Isolation" establis hed by the DOH regu lations (Table 9, WAC 246-290-490).” ] Where the Purveyor imposes mandatory pr emises isolation in compliance with DOH regulations, or agrees to the customer's volunt ary premises isolation through the installation of a RPBA immediately downstream of th e Purveyor's water me ter, the customer acknowledges his obligation to comply with the other cross- connection control regulations having jurisdiction (i.e., Uniform Plumbing Co de). Although the Purveyor's requirements for installation, testing, and repair of back flow assemblies may be limited to the RPBAs used for premises isolation, th e customer agrees to the other terms herein as a condition of allowing a direct connection to the Purveyor's service pipe. The customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Purveyor fo r all contamination of the customer's plumbing system or the Purveyor's distribution system that results from an unprotected or inadequately protected cross connection within the cu stomer’s premises. This indemnifica tion shall pertain to al l backflow conditions th at may arise from the Purveyor's suspension of water supply or redu ction of water pressure , recognizing that the air gap separation otherwise re quired would require the cust omer to provide adequate facilities to collect, store, and pump water for hi s/her premises. The customer agrees that, in the event le gal action is required and commenced between the Purveyor and the custom er to enforce the terms and cond itions herein, the substantially prevailing party shall be entitle d to reimbursement of all incurred co sts and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the Court. The customer acknowledges that the Purveyor's survey of a customer's premises is for the

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix A sole purpose of establishing the Purveyor's mi nimum requirements for the protection of the public water supply syst em, commensurate with the Purveyor 's assessment of the degree of hazard. It shall not be assumed by the customer or any regulatory agency that the Purveyor's survey, requirements for the installation of backflow pr evention assemblies, lack of requirements for the installation of backflow prevention asse mblies, or other actions by the Purveyor’s personnel constitute an approval of the customer 's plumbing system or an assurance to the customer of the absence of cross connections therein. The customer acknowledges the right of the Purveyor, in keeping with changes to Washington State regulations, industry standa rds, or the Purveyor's risk management policies, to impose retroa ctive requirements for additio nal cross-connection control measures. The Purveyor will r ecord the customer's ag reement to the above te rms for serv ice on an “Application for Water Service,” “Application for Ch ange of Water Service,” or other such form prepared by the Purveyor an d signed by the customer. Implementation of the Cro ss-Connection Co ntrol Policy The Purveyor will en gage the services of a DOH-certified CCS to develo p, implement and be in responsible charge of the {Insert PWS name} Water System’s cross-co nnection control program. The Purveyor, under the direct ion of the aforemen tioned CCS, will prep are a written cross- connection control program plan to implement th e requirements of this resolution. The written program shall be consistent with this resolution and shall comply with th e requirements of Chapter 246-290 WAC (Group A Drin king Water Regulations).

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix B Appendix B Example Cross-Connection Control Program for a Non-Community System Contents Appendix B contains an example written cross-co nnection control (CCC) program plan and an example legal instrument for a non-community system. How to Use Appendix B The documents in Appendix B have been arra nged and formatted for ease of review by the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) when it evaluate s the CCC program with respect to the regulations. Therefore, DOH recommends th at purveyors follow the format (i.e., use as a template) whenever possible. However, public water systems are not required to use the exam- ple program and legal instrument. DOH recognizes that some PWSs may have a particular ap- proach or institutional requirements that may dictat e a different format or wording in the written program. Description of Typical Non-Community Systems The majority of non-community wate r systems, in addition to the de finitions in the Drinking Water Regulations, Chapter 246-290 WAC, ha ve the following characteristics: • The water system owner (purveyor) serv es his/her own facilities; and • The consumers are the occupants or users (employ ees, students, patrons, visitors, etc.) of the facilities. Examples of Non-Comm unity Water Systems Non-community water system s of this type include, but are not limited to: • Schools, colleges, day care ce nters, and simi lar institutions; • Clinics, hospitals, public parks, golf courses, fairgrounds, and playgrounds; • Hotels, motels, resorts, campgrounds , RV parks and highway rest areas; • Businesses such as stores, nurs eries, service stations, restau rants and laundromats; and • Industrial plants, food processing facilities, shellfish pro cessors, and temporary farm worker housing.

--- Page 197 ---
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix B Community Systems with Non-Commu nity System Characteristics Some community water systems have characteristic s similar to non-commun ity systems, i.e., the water system owner (purveyor) serv es his/her own facilities, and the consumers are the occupants or users of the facilities. Examples of such community systems are thos e that serve long-term occupants such as: • Educational institutions with dormitori es or student and staff residences; • Nursing homes, retir ement centers and me ntal institutions; • Correctional institutio ns such as prisons; • Mobile home parks and apartment complexes; and • Military bases with barracks or other personnel housing. For CCC program purposes, communi ty systems with non- community system ch aracteristics, such as the examples listed above, should develop and im plement a program simila r to the ex ample CCC program for non-community water syst ems provided in this Appendix. Non-Community Systems with Community System Characteristics Some non-community water systems may have both non-community an d community systems characteristics. For example, some non-community systems serve developments where there is a mix of recreational and residential connections. In this example, the Purveyor owns the recreational facilities, but the residential conn ections are privately owned. Non-community systems with characteristics of community and non-community systems should base their written pr ograms primarily on Appendix B. Ho wever, the relevant elements of Appendix A (or the DOH Very Small Wate r System CCC Guidance) should be incorporated into the Appendix B program plan where ap plicable (to address CCC issu es for the non-purveyor owned connections). Instructions To use the example program plan, non-community water systems are encouraged to: Copy the example program file into Word ( download from the web- site or obtain from DOH electronically); Retain the basic formatting and text of the example program and fill in the blanks, deci- sion table and check boxes where indicated to “customize” the example program; Include or delete optional and/or additional language shown in the example program to reflect system-specific decisions; and Insert the completed written CCC program in the Small Water System Management Pro- gram (SWSMP) or Water System Plan (WSP).

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix B Cross-Connection Control Program for ________________________Water System A. Requirement for Program The {Insert PWS name and ID number} hereinafter referred to as “the Purveyor”, has the responsibility to protect the pub lic water systems from contamination due to cross connections. A cross connection may be defined as " Any actual or poten tial physical connection between a potable water line and any pipe, ve ssel, or machine that c ontains or has a probability of containing a non- potable gas or liquid, such that it is possible fo r a non-potable gas or li quid to enter the potable water system by backflow.” All public water system s are required to develop and impl ement cross-connection control (CCC) programs. The CCC requirements are contained in WAC 246-290-490 of the Group A Drinking Water Regulations. The minimum required el ements of a CCC program are as follows: Establishment of legal authority and program policies; Evaluation of premises for cross-connection hazards; Elimination and/or cont rol of cross connections; Provision of qualified personnel; 5. Inspection and testing of backflow preventers; Quality control of testing process; Response to backflow incidents; Public education for consumers; Record keeping for CCC program; and Special requirements for reclaimed water use. Other requirements of a CCC program include: Coordination with the Local Administrative Author ity (LAA), i.e. th e local building or plumbing official, re garding CCC activities; Inclusion of a written CCC pr ogram in a WSP or SWSMP; and Prohibition of the intentio nal return of used water. B. Program Objectives The objectives of th e CCC program are to: Reasonably reduce the risk of contamination of the source of supply and water distribution system; and

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix B 2. Prohibition of Return of Used Water: The water system must prohi bit the intentional return of used water to the Purveyor’s distri bution system per WAC 246-290-490 (2)(d). a. Definition - Used water is defined as water that has left the control of the Purveyor. b. Used Water Policies - Since the Purveyor owns both the water supply fa cilities and the plumbing systems, the water has not, technically, left th e control of the Purveyor. However, for protection of the drinking water quality and the health of the employees/building occupants, the Purveyor will institute the following policies: • Plumbing design or change s will not allow water that has been used for such purposes as heating or cooling to be retu rned to the drinking water system; and • Buildings and facilities with two or more water serv ice connections that are internally connected such as to provi de a flow–through condition will have each service isolated by either an RPBA or DCVA, depending upon the level of hazard assessed by the Purveyor’s CCS. F. Relationship to Other Pla nning and Program Operations The Purveyor will consider the impacts of the CCC program upon the planning and operations requirements of the {Insert PWS name } Water System. Such consider ations include, but are not limited to, ensuring that: The design of the water distribution system (and plumbing system) provides for expected head losses resulting from installation of backflow assemblies; CCC program personnel are consulted in the design of water and wastewater treatment facilities and when proposals are made to receive or distribute reclaimed water; Operations under normal and abnormal conditions do not result in excessive pressure losses; Cross-connection issues are considered in water quality investigations; and Adequate financial and administrative res ources are provided to carry out the CCC pro- gram.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix B Legal Instrument for a Non-community Water System CCC Program Background Where the Purveyor owns both the public water sy stem and the facilities served by the water sys- tem (i.e., the plumbing systems up to the free-flow ing tap), the Purveyor may already have the legal authority to establish a CCC program. Propr ietors of restaurants or small businesses that have their own water systems are examples where the legal authority already exists. In such cases, the Purveyor may not require a formal le gal instrument, but only a declaration of owner- ship of the system and facilities served and th e intent to establish and implement a CCC program consistent with WAC 246-290-490. In other cases, such as school districts, it ma y be necessary for the governing body (such as the School Board) to adopt a resolution or similar doc ument to establish the authority and intent to adopt and implement a CCC program. For this reason, a sample resolution for a non-community water system is presented below.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix B Resolution No. ________ Cross-Connection Control Policy Finding of Fact: Whereas it is the responsibility of a wa ter purveyor to provide water that m eets Washington State water quality standards to all consumers occu pying or visiting the Purveyor’s premises; Whereas it is the water purveyo r's responsibility to prev ent the contamination of the public water system from the source of supply (i.e., to the customer's connectio n to the service pipe or meter); Whereas the Purveyor also owns the facilities and the pl umbing systems that de liver the water to the consumers; Whereas it is a requiremen t of the Washington State Department of Health for the Purveyor to establish a cross-connection control program satisfactory to DOH; Now be it resolved that the {Insert PWS name }, hereinafter referred to as “the Purveyor”, establishes the following policy to protect the Purv eyor-owned water system and plumbing facilities from the risk of contamin ation. For public health and safety, this policy sh all apply equally to all new and existing facilities. A. Definitions Unless otherwise defined, all terms used in this resolution pertaining to cross-connection control have the same definitions as those contained in WAC 246-290-010 of the Washington State Drinking Water Regulations an d Chapter 2 of the Uniform Pl umbing Code as amended for Washington State (Chapter 51-56 WAC). B. Administrative Provisions The Purveyor shall engage th e services of a Department of Health (DOH) certified cross- connection control specia list (CCS), by employment or by co ntract, to develop, implement, and be in responsible charge of the { {Insert PWS name } Water System’s CCC program. The Purveyor, under the direction of the CCS as provided for in B-1, shall prepare a written CCC program plan to implement the requirements of th is resolution. The written CCC program plan will be consistent with this reso lution and shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 246-290 WA C (Group A Drinking Water Regulations) and with Chapter 51-56 WAC (Uniform Plumbing Code as amended for Washington).

Cross Connection Control Manual, Ac cepted Procedures and Practice, published by the Pacific Northwest Section, Amer ican Water Works Association, or latest edition thereof. c. Cross-Connection Control Guidance Manual for Small Water Systems, published by the Washington State Department of H ealth, Office of Drinking Water. The Purveyor shall incorporate the written program plan into the Water System Plan or Small Water System Management Program as ap plicable and shall su bmit the program to DOH for approval when requested. C. Technical Provisions The Purveyor’s CCS shall perform hazard asse ssments of all water system and water-using facilities owned by the Purveyor acco rding to a reason able schedule. The Purveyor shall eliminate all cross-connect ions that are discovered by the CCS. Where it is impossible or impractical to eliminate the cross-connecti ons, they shall be protected against by installation of a backflow preventer. The ty pe, location and schedule of installation of the backflow preventer shall be as recommended by the Purveyor’s CCS. When a facility or building owned or served by the Purveyor is of a type included on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-4 90(4), the building or facility plumbing system shall be isolated from the rest of the water system by installation of a reduced pressure principle backflow assembly (RPBA) or air gap (AG). The prem ises isolation backflow preventer will be installed at a location recommended by the CCS. Cross-connection hazards foun d within buildings owned by th e Purveyor will be protected against as according to the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) as amended for Washington. For cross-connection hazards and/or specific plum bing fixtures that are not address in the UPC, the Purveyor will provide protection in accordance with th e fixture protection tables found in the most recently pu blished edition of the PNWS-AWWA Cross Connection Control Manual . All backflow preventers ow ned by the Purveyor shall be inspected and/or tested in accordance with WAC 246-290-490 (i.e. at the time of installation, after repair, reinstallation or relocation and after a backflow incident). After the in itial test, the Purveyor

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix B will ensure that Purveyor-owned backflow preventers are tested at least once annually. The Purveyor will ensure that a purveyor-approve d, DOH-certified backfl ow assembly tester (BAT) tests all assemblies. The Pu rveyor will reinstall, repair or replace as soon as feasible any backflow preventers that fa il an inspection and/or a test. The Purveyor shall maintain records of hazard assessments, backflow preventers, and backflow preventer tests and inspections. The Purveyor shall make a ll data concerning the CCC program available to DOH when requested. The Purveyor shall allocate resources as necessary to impl ement the provis ions of this resolution and the CCC program adopted. D. Other Provisions If any provisions in this resolutio n, or in the written CCC progra m plan adopted by the Purveyor, are found to be less stringent than or inconsiste nt with the Drinking Water Regulations (Chapter 246-290 WAC), the Uniform Plumbi ng Code (Chapter 51-56 WAC), or any other Washington State statutes or rules, the more stringent st atute, rule, or regulations shall apply.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix C Appendix C Backflow Incident Response Plan for a Small Water System A. General This Backflow Incident Response Plan should be considered a supplement to the Purveyor’s Emergency Plan. Purveyors should immediately begin a backflow incident investigation whenever the initial evaluation of a water quality complaint indicates that: A backflow incident has occu rred (i.e., drinking water supp ly has been contaminated) or may have occurred; or The complaint can’t be explained as a "normal" aesthetic problem. Also, whenever a water main break (or power outage for pumped systems) causes a widespread loss of water pressure in the system (creating back siphonage conditi ons), purveyors should initiate a check of distribution system wate r quality as a precurso r to the need for a backflow incident investigation. WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyor s to notify DOH, the Local Administrative Authority and local health jurisdiction as soon as possible, but no late r than the end of the ne xt business day when a backflow incident contaminates the potable water supply (in the distributio n system and/or in the customer's plumbing system). Purveyors shoul d include a list of emergency contact telephone numbers at the beginning of the water system’s O & M Manual, so that the information is readily available when an incident occurs. A backflow incident investigation is often a team effort. The investigation should be made by or initially led by the DOH-cer tified Cross-Conne ction Control Specialist em ployed by the Purveyor. The investigation team may include state health (regional) staff, local health personnel and/or local plumbing inspectors. Purveyors can get more detailed gu idance on how to respond to a backflow incident from the manual, Backflow Incident Investigation Procedures , published by the Paci fic Northwest Section, American Water Works Association (PNWS-AW WA). Contact inform ation for the PNWS- AWWA is provided in Appendix F.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix C B. Short List of Tasks Small water system purveyor s can use the following sh ort list of tasks as in itial guidance for dealing with backflow incidents. Purv eyors should consult the most recently pub lished edition of the PNWS-AWWA Backflow Incident Investigation Procedures Manual referenced above for greater detail as soon as possible after learning of a po ssible or confirmed backfl ow incident. Note: the water system is referred to as th e Purveyor in the short task list. Customer Notification a. As soon as possible, the Purveyor will no tify customers not to consume or use water. b. The Purveyor will st art the notification with the custom ers nearest in lo cation to the assumed source of contaminat ion (usually the customer(s ) making the water quality complaint). c. The Purveyor will inform the customer about the reason for the backflow incident investigation and the Purveyor's efforts to re store water quality as soon as possible. The Purveyor will let the customer know th at customers will be informed when they may use water, the need to boil wate r used for consumption until a satisfactory bacteriological test result is obtained from the lab, etc. d. Where a customer cannot be contacted immediately, the Purveyor will place a written notice on the front door handle, and a follow-up visit will be made to conf irm that the customer received notice ab out the possible contaminat ion of the water supply. e. When dealing with a backflow incident, the Purveyor will let customers know that it could take several days to identify the sour ce and type of contaminant(s) and to clean and disinfect the distribution system. Identification of Source of Contamination a. The Purveyor will give consideration to the distributio n system as a potential source of the contaminant (e.g., air valve inlet below ground). b. The Purveyor will not star t flushing the dist ribution system until the source of contamination is iden tified (flushing may aggravate th e backflow situation, and will likely remove the contaminant before a water sample can be collected to fully identify the contaminant). c. The Purveyor will conduct a house-to-hou se survey to search for the source of contamination and the extent that the cont aminant has spread through the distribution system. Note: a check of wa ter meters may show a return of water (meter running backward) to the distribution system.

--- Page 216 ---
_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix C d. When the cross connection responsible for the system contamination is located, the Purveyor should discontinue water serv ice to that customer , until the customer completes the corrective actio n ordered by the Purveyor. Isolation of Contaminated Portion of System a. The Purveyor will isolate the portions of the system that are susp ected of being contaminated by closing isolat ing valves; leav e one valve open to en sure that positive water pressure is maintained th roughout the isolated system. b. The Purveyor will be sure to notify all aff ected customers in the is olated area first and then notify other customer s served by the system. Public Health Impacts a. The Purveyor will se ek immediate input fr om and work wi th state and local health agencies to accurately comm unicate and properly mitigate potential health effects resulting from the backflow incident. b. If appropriate, the Purveyor will refe r customers that may have consumed the contaminant or had their household (or commer cial) plumbing systems contaminated to public health perso nnel and Local Admini strative Authorities (p lumbing inspectors). Cleaning/Disinfecting the Distribution System a. The Purveyor will develo p and implement a pr ogram for cleaning the contaminated distribution system consistent with the contaminant(s) identified. b. Where both chemical and b acteriological contamination has occurred, the Purveyor will disinfect the system after the remo val of the chemical contaminant. c. Where any bacteriological co ntamination is suspected, th e Purveyor will provide field disinfection. C. Additional Info rmation on Cleaning /Disinfecting the Di stribution System Most chemical or physical contaminants can be flushed from the water distribution system or customer's plumbing system with adequate flushing velocity. However, this may not be the case in systems where scale and corrosion deposits (e.g., tuberculation on old cast iron mains) provide a restriction to obtaining adequate flushing velocity , or where chemical deposits or bacteriological slimes (biofilm) are present (on which the chemical contaminant may adhere).

--- Page 217 ---
_______________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix C To remove a chemical or physical contaminant from the distribu tion system, purveyors may need to: Physically clean the affected ar ea using foam swabs (pigs); and/or Alter the form of the chemical contaminant (e.g., through oxidation using chlorination or addition of detergents). When adding any chemical (including chlorine) to remove a contaminant from the distribution system, it is essential th at the Purveyor fully understand th e chemistry of th e contaminant. Adding the wrong chemical could make the contamin ant more toxic to customers and/or more difficult to remove from the distribution system. To disinfect water mains using the "slug" or "continuous flow" meth od, a field unit sh ould be used for chlorine injection, such as a chemical fe ed - metering or propor tioning pump for sodium hypochlorite. Purveyors should contact the appropriate DOH region al office to discuss proposed approaches to contaminant removal and disi nfection prior to taking corrective action.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix D Backflow Assembly Testers Pre-Approved for Submitting Test Reports to the {Insert PWS name} {Insert date here} The following table lists Backflow Assembly Testers (BATs) that are pre-approved to test backflow assemblies in our water system’s se rvice area. We compile d the list by identifying individual testers who requested to work in this area or who previously submitted properly completed test reports to our system. {Optional language: An asterisk (*) denotes BATs that are also DOH-certified Cross-Connection Control Specialists (CCSs).} Note: listing does not constit ute an endorsement of thes e BATs by our system or a certification of the quality of services they provide. To appear on our pre-approved BAT list, the tester must: • Show proof of current BAT certification from DOH; • Submit documentation that his/her assembly test equipment has been verified for accuracy within the last 12 months and calibrated if needed; and • {Optional language: Meet other criteria establis hed by our system including____________________ { insert additional requirements here su ch as business licenses, etc. } As an alternative to the above, pre-approved testers must document that they appear on the approved BAT list of another nearby water system that has a testing QA/QC program acceptable to our system. WAC 246-290-490 requires a DOH-certified BA T to test all assemblies (RPBA, RP DA, DCVA, etc.) that protect the distribution system. Assemblies that protect the public water system must be tested in accordance with DOH- approved field test procedures: • Upon installation, and a nnually thereafter; • After repair, reinstallation, or relocation; and • After a backflow incident. Note: the DOH BAT certification is a special certification separate from othe r waterworks operator certification categories, plumbing licenses, contractor registration, etc. Other licenses, cert ifications and/or re gistrations may be required to install backflow prevention assemblies and/or perform maintenance work on assemblies within buildings. However, only a currently DOH-certified BAT may test the assemblies that protect the public water system from contamination.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________ Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems March 2004 Appendix D Backflow Incident Report Form Many backflow incidents occur that are no t reported. This is usually because: • The incidents are of short duration; • The incidents are not detected; • Neither the customer nor the Purveyor realizes that a contam ination was caused by a backflow incident; • The customer is not aware the incident should be reported; • Customers do not know who to report the incidents to; and/or • Liability concerns on the pa rt of either the customer or purveyor or both. DOH and the PNWS-AWWA Cross-Co nnection Control Co mmittee are making an effort to bring backflow incidents to the attention of water purveyors , Local Administrative Authorities, legislators, and the general public. If you have any knowledge of a backflow incide nt, please fill out a copy of the Backflow Incident Report Form and return it to DOH an d the PNWS-AWWA CCC committee.

Cross-connection control programs help protect public health by preventing contamination of the drinking water as it is delivered to water system customers. The attached brochure explains what a cross connection is, describes typical household cross connections and what you can do to help protect your drinking water. As part of our efforts to keep your drinking water safe , we are conducting a cross-connection control hazard survey of residential customers served by our system. The purpose of the survey is to help us determine if any of our residential customers have special plumbing or activities on their premises that could increase the risk of contamination to our water system. For most residential customers, the cross-connection contro l hazard posed to the public water system is minimal. This is because your household plumbing was installed in compliance with the Uniform Plumbing Code. The Uniform Plumbing Code generally provides adequate protec tion of your water potable water piping and our public water distribution system from cross connections. However, a few customers with special plumbing or activities on their premises may pose an increased health risk to ot her customers served by our system. These customers may need to have a backflow preventer installed on their service lines or pr ovide alternate protection to prevent contamination of the public water system. Please complete the attached questionnaire by checking the applicable boxes on the table; and return the completed, signed questionnaire by {insert date} to the address shown on the letterhead {or insert address if different }. Thanks in advance for filling out the questionnaire. We ap preciate your cooperation in helping us to protect the drinking water we deliver to our customers. If you ha ve any questions about the su rvey or how to fill out the questionnaire, please contact me at { insert phone number }. We will review your questionnaire and determine whether we need to contact your for further information. Sincerely, Name CCC Program Manager Enclosures: CCC Brochure Water Use Questionnaire

Cross-connection cont rol programs protect public health by preventing contamination of the drinking water supply. The attached brochure explains what a cross connection is and what you can do to help protect your drinking water. As part of the cross-connection control program, our system must assess the degree of hazard posed by each of our customer's plumbing systems upon the public water system. Non-residential customers a nd multi-family residential customers pose a special concern, because of the greater scope and complexity of their plumbing systems, special uses of water on the premises (e.g., manufacturing), fire protection systems, etc. Depending on the hazard assessment results, you may need to have a backflow preven ter installed on your service line or provide alternate protection. A cross-connection survey needs to be conducted for us to make the hazard assessment for your premises . The drinking water regulations require a person with special training, i.e., a De partment of Health certified Cross- Connection Specialist (CCS), to conduct the surveys. Our system’s policy is to have surveys of all non-residential premises and multi-family residential premises conducted by a CCS employed by the customer . Survey results must be submitted to our system for review. Please arrange for the attached survey form to be completed and returned to this office by {insert date} . A list of local CCSs who provide this type of service is attached. We appreciate your cooperation in m eeting this hazard survey requirement .

Cross-connection cont rol programs protect public health by preventing contamination of the drinking water as it is delivered to people served by the water system. The purpose of this letter is to inform you of a requirement to install a backflow assembly. Our water system’s policy considers each of our customer’s plumbing systems, starting from the termination of the service pipe downstream of the water meter, to pose a pote ntial cross-connection hazard to the public water system. Our policy requires a backflow prevention assembly commensurate with the degree of hazard to be installed on the service line. The purpose of this backflow prevention assembly is to isolate your plumbing system from the water distribution system. We’ve attached a copy of Resolution { insert number } describing our cross-connection control policy. We have received the cross-connection control survey report submitted by your Cross-Connection Control Specialist (CCS). The survey assessed the overall public health hazard posed by your plumbing system (and water use) to the public water system. We agre e with the assessment made by the CCS. Based on the assessment, a Department of Health-approved {insert type of assembly} is required to be installed on your service line (at a location downstream of the water meter). Please make arrangements for the assembly to be installed by { insert date } or when your plumbing system is modified, whichever comes sooner. { Optional language : We realize that this expense was not anticipated, so if you are unable to comply with this deadline, please contact us to discuss an alternative date}. We’ve enclosed a copy of our standard installation drawings for this type of as sembly. Your CCS should oversee the installation of the assembly to ensure complian ce with these standards.
