I (4 –1–01 Edition) §1.818 –2 taxable year for inclusion of income and deduction of expenses under an ac-crual method of accounting, see sec-tions 451 and 461 and the regulationsthereunder. (2) Section 818(a)(2) provides that, to the extent permitted under this sec-tion, a life insurance company ’s meth- od of accounting may be a combinationof the accrual method with any othermethod of accounting permitted bychapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Codeof 1954, other than the cash receiptsand disbursements method. Thus, sec-tion 818(a)(2) specifically prohibits theuse by a life insurance company of thecash receipts and disbursements meth-od either separately or in combinationwith a permissible method of account-ing. The term ‘‘method of accounting ’’ includes not only the over-all methodof accounting of the taxpayer but alsothe accounting treatment of any item.For purposes of section 818(a)(2), a lifeinsurance company may elect to com-pute its taxable income under an over-all method of accounting consisting ofthe accrual method combined with the special methods of accounting for par-ticular items of income and expenseprovided under other sections of chap-ter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of1954, other than the cash receipts anddisbursements method. These methodsof accounting for special items includethe accounting treatment provided fordepreciation (section 167), research andexperimental expenditures (section174), soil and water conservation ex-penditures (section 175), organizationalexpenditures (section 248), etc. In addi-tion, a life insurance company may,where applicable, use the crop methodof accounting (as provided in the regu-lations under sections 61 and 162), andthe installment method of accountingfor sales of realty and casual sales ofpersonalty (as provided in section453(b)). To the extent not inconsistentwith the provisions of the InternalRevenue Code of 1954 or the regulationsthereunder and the method of account-ing adopted by the taxpayer pursuantto this section, all computations enter-ing into the determination of taxes im-posed by part I shall be made in a man-ner consistent with the manner re-quired for purposes of the annual state-ment approved by the National Asso- ciation of Insurance Commissioners. (3)(i) An election to use any of the special methods of accounting referredto in subparagraph (2) of this para-graph which was made pursuant to anyprovisions of the Internal RevenueCode of 1954 or prior revenue laws forpurposes of determining a company ’s tax liabilities for prior years, shallhave the same force and effect in deter-mining the items of gross investmentincome under section 804(b) and theitems of deduction under section 804(c)of the Life Insurance Company IncomeTax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112) as if suchAct had not been enacted. (ii) For purposes of determining gain or loss from operations under section809(b), in computing the life insurancecompany ’s share of investment yield under section 809(b) (1)(A) and (2)(A),an election with respect to any of thespecial methods of accounting referredto in subparagraph (2) of this para-graph which was made pursuant to anyprovision of the Internal Revenue Codeof 1954 or prior revenue laws, shall notbe affected in any way by the enact-ment of the Life Insurance CompanyIncome Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112). (iii) For purposes of determining gain or loss from operations under section809(b), in computing the items of grossamount under section 809(c) and the de-duction items under section 809(d), anelection to use any of the special meth-ods of accounting referred to in sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph must bemade in accordance with the specificstatutory provisions of the sectionscontaining such elections and the regu-lations thereunder. However, where aparticular election may be made onlywith the consent of the Commissioner(either because the time for makingthe election without the consent of theCommissioner has expired or becausethe particular section contained noprovision for making an election with-out consent), and the time prescribedby the applicable regulations for sub-mitting a request for permission tomake such an election for the taxableyear 1958 has expired, a life insurancecompany may make such an electionfor the year 1958 at the time of filingits return for that year (including ex-tensions thereof).

633Internal Revenue Service, Treasury §1.818 –2 insurance company may elect any of the methods of depreciation prescribedin section 167 (to the extent permittedunder that section and the regulationsthereunder) with respect to those as-sets, or any portion thereof, for whichno depreciation was allowable underprior revenue laws, for example, fur-niture and fixtures used in the under-writing department. Similarly, a lifeinsurance company shall be permittedto make an election under section461(c) (relating to the accrual of realproperty taxes) with respect to realproperty for which no deduction wasallowable under prior revenue laws.Any such election shall be made in themanner and form prescribed in the ap-plicable regulations. (iv) For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the method usedunder section 1016(a)(3)(C) (relating toadjustments to basis) in determiningthe amount of exhaustion, wear andtear, obsolescence, and amortizationactually sustained shall not preclude ataxpayer from electing any of themethods prescribed in section 167 in ac-cordance with the provisions of thatsection and the regulations thereunderfor determining the amount of such ex-haustion, wear and tear, obsolescence,and amortization for the year 1958. Forexample, if the amount of depreciationactually sustained, under section1016(a)(3)(C), on a life insurance com-pany ’s home office building (other than that portion for which depreciationwas allowable under prior revenuelaws) is determined on the straight linemethod, the life insurance companymay elect for the year 1958 to use anyof the methods prescribed in section 167for determining its depreciation allow-ance for 1958. However, such electionshall be binding for 1958, and for allsubsequent taxable years, unless con-sent to change such election, if re-quired, is obtained from the Commis-sioner in accordance with the provi-sions of section 167 and the regulationsthereunder. (4)(i) For purposes of section 805(b)(3)(B)(i) (relating to the deter-mination of the current earnings ratefor any taxable year beginning beforeJanuary 1, 1958), the determination forany year of the investment yield andthe assets shall be made as though thetaxpayer had been on the accrual method prescribed in subparagraph (1)of this paragraph for such year, or theaccrual method in combination withthe other methods of accounting pre-scribed in subparagraph (2) of thisparagraph, if these other methods ofaccounting are used by the taxpayer indetermining the investment yield andassets for the taxable year 1958. How-ever, where the method used for deter-mining the deduction under section 167for the year 1958 differs from the meth-od used in prior years, the amount ofthe deduction actually allowed or al-lowable for such prior years for pur-poses of section 1016(a)(2) (relating toadjustments to basis) shall be theamount to be taken into account in de-termining the current earnings rateunder section 805(b)(3)(B)(i). (ii) For purposes of section 812(b)(1)(C) (relating to operations losscarrybacks and carryovers for yearsprior to 1958), the determination forthose years of the gain or loss from op-erations shall be made as though thetaxpayer had been on the accrualmethod of accounting prescribed insubparagraph (1) of this paragraph forsuch year, or the accrual method incombination with the other methods ofaccounting prescribed in subparagraph(2) of this paragraph, if these othermethods of accounting are used by thetaxpayer in the determination of gainor loss from operations for the taxableyear 1958. However, where any adjust-ment to basis is required under section1016(a)(3)(C) on account of exhaustion,wear and tear, obsolescence, amortiza-tion, and depletion sustained, theamount actually sustained as deter-mined under section 1016(a)(3)(C) foreach of the years involved shall be theamount allowed in the determinationof gain or loss from operations for pur-poses of section 812(b)(1)(C). (b) Adjustments required if accrual method of accounting was not used in1957. The items of gross amount taken into account under section 809(c) andthe items of deductions allowed undersection 809(d) for the taxable year 1958shall be determined as though the tax-payer had been on the accrual methodof accounting prescribed in paragraph(a) of this section for all prior years.Thus, life insurance companies not on VerDate 11<MAY>2000 01:46 Apr 14, 2001 Jkt 194087 PO 00000 Frm 00633 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\194087T.XXX pfrm08 PsN: 194087T

63426 CFR Ch. I (4 –1–01 Edition) §1.818 –2 the accrual method for the year 1957 shall accrue, as of December 31, 1957,those items of gross amount whichwould have been properly taken intoaccount for the year 1957 if the com-pany had been on the accrual methoddescribed in section 818(a). Likewise,life insurance companies not on the ac-crual method for the year 1957 shall ac-crue, as of December 31, 1957, thoseitems of deductions which would havebeen properly allowed for the year 1957if the company had been on the accrualmethod described in section 818(a). Forexample, if certain premium amountswere received during the year 1958 butsuch amounts would have been prop-erly taken into account for the year1957 if the taxpayer had been on the ac-crual method for the year 1957, thenthe taxpayer will not be required totake such premium amounts into ac-count for the year 1958. If, for example,certain claims, benefits, and losseswere paid during the year 1958 but suchitems would have been properly takeninto account for the year 1957 if thetaxpayer had been on the accrualmethod for the year 1957, then the tax-payer will not be permitted to deductsuch expense items for the year 1958.For a special transitional rule applica-ble with respect to changes in methodof accounting required by section 818(a)and paragraph (a) of this section, seesection 818(e) and §1.818–6. (c) Change of basis in computing re- serves. (1) Section 806(b) provides that if the basis for determining the amountof any item referred to in section 810(c)as of the close of the taxable year dif-fers from the basis for such determina-tion as of the beginning of the taxableyear, then for purposes of subpart B,part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of theCode (relating to the determination oftaxable investment income), theamount of such item shall be theamount computed on the old basis as ofthe close of the taxable year and theamount computed on the new basis asof the beginning of the next taxableyear. Similarly, section 810(d)(1) pro-vides rules for determining the amountof the adjustment to be made for pur-poses of subpart C, part I, subchapterL, chapter 1 of the Code (relating tothe determination of gain or loss fromoperations), if the basis for deter-mining any item referred to in section 810(c) as of the close of any taxableyear differs from the basis for such de-termination as of the close of the pre-ceding taxable year. Under an accrualmethod of accounting, a change in thebasis or method of computing the amount of liability of any item re-ferred to in section 810(c) occurs in thetaxable year in which all the eventshave occurred which determine thechange in the basis or method of com-puting the amount of such liabilityand, in which, the amount thereof(whether increased or decreased) can bedetermined with reasonable accuracy. (2) The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustratedby the following examples: Example 1. Assume that during the taxable year 1960, M, a life insurance company, de-termines that the amount of its life insur-ance reserves held with respect to a par-ticular block of contracts is understated onthe present basis being used in valuing suchliability and that such liability can be moreaccurately reflected by changing from thepresent basis to a particular new basis. As-sume that M uses such new basis in com-puting its reserves under such contracts atthe end of the taxable year 1960. Under theprovisions of section 818(a) and subparagraph(1) of this paragraph, the change in basis forpurposes of sections 806(b) and 810(d) occursduring the taxable year 1960, the year inwhich all the events have occurred which de-termine the change in basis and the amountof any increase (or decrease) attributable tosuch change can be determined with reason-able accuracy. Such change shall be treatedas having occurred during the taxable year1960 whether M determines that its liabilityunder such contracts was understated for thefirst time during 1960, or that its liabilityunder such contracts has, in fact, been un-derstated for a number of prior years. Example 2. Assume the facts are the same as in example 1, except that during the tax-able year 1960 the insurance department ofState X issues a ruling, pursuant to author-ity conferred by statute, requiring M to usethe particular new basis which more accu-rately reflects its liability with respect tosuch contracts and that as a result of suchruling, M uses the new basis in computing itsreserves under such contracts for the taxableyears 1958, 1959, and 1960. Under the provi-sions of section 818(a) and subparagraph (1)of this paragraph, the change in basis forpurposes of sections 806(b) and 810(d) occursduring the taxable year 1960, the year inwhich all the events have occurred which de-termine that a change in basis should be VerDate 11<MAY>2000 01:46 Apr 14, 2001 Jkt 194087 PO 00000 Frm 00634 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\194087T.XXX pfrm08 PsN: 194087T

[T.D. 6558, 26 FR 2785, Apr. 4, 1961] §1.818 –3 Amortization of premium and accrual of discount. (a) In general. Section 818(b) provides that the appropriate items of income,deductions, and adjustments underpart I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of theCode, shall be adjusted to reflect theappropriate amortization of premiumand the appropriate accrual of discounton bonds, notes, debentures, or otherevidences of indebtedness held by a lifeinsurance company. Such adjustmentsare limited to the amount of appro-priate amortization or accrual attrib-utable to the taxable year with respectto such securities which are not in de-fault as to principal or interest andwhich are amply secured. The questionof ample security will be resolved ac-cording to the rules laid down fromtime to time by the National Associa-tion of Insurance Commissioners. Theadjustment for amortization of pre-mium decreases the gross investmentincome, the exclusion and reduction forwholly tax-exempt interest, the exclu-sion and deduction for partially tax-ex-empt interest, and the basis or ad-justed basis of such securities. The ad-justment for accrual of discount in-creases the gross investment income,the exclusion and reduction for whollytax-exempt interest, the exclusion anddeduction for partially tax-exempt in-terest, and the basis or adjusted basisof such securities. However, for taxableyears beginning after May 31, 1960, onlythe accrual of discount relating toissue discount will increase the exclu-sion and reduction for wholly tax-ex-empt interest. See section 103. (b) Acquisitions before January 1, 1958. (1) In the case of any such security ac-quired before January 1, 1958, the pre-mium is the excess of its acquisitionvalue over its maturity value and thediscount is the excess of its maturityvalue over its acquisition value. Theacquisition value of any such securityis its cost (including buying commis-sions or brokerage but excluding anyamounts paid for accrued interest) ifpurchased for cash, or if not purchasedfor cash, its then fair market value.The maturity value of any such secu- rity is the amount payable thereundereither at the maturity date or an ear-lier call date. The earlier call date ofany such security may be the earliestinterest payment date if it is callableor payable at such date, the earliest date at which it is callable at par, orsuch other call or payment date, priorto maturity, specified in the securityas may be selected by the life insur-ance company. A life insurance com-pany which adjusts amortization ofpremium or accrual of discount withreference to a particular call or pay-ment date must make the adjustmentswith reference to the value on suchdate and may not, after selecting suchdate, use a different call or paymentdate, or value, in the calculation ofsuch amortization or discount with re-spect to such security unless the secu-rity was not in fact called or paid onsuch selected date. (2) The adjustments for amortization of premium and accrual of discountwill be determined: (i) According to the method regularly employed by the company, if suchmethod is reasonable, or (ii) According to the method pre- scribed by this section. A method of amortization of premium or accrual of discount will be deemed‘‘regularly employed ’’ by a life insur- ance company if the method was con-sistently followed in prior taxableyears, or if, in the case of a companywhich has never before made such ad-justments, the company initiates inthe first taxable year for which the ad-justments are made a reasonable meth-od of amortization of premium or ac-crual of discount and consistently fol-lows such method thereafter. Ordi-narily, a company regularly employs amethod in accordance with the statuteof some State, Territory, or the Dis-trict of Columbia, in which it operates. (3) The method of amortization and accrual prescribed by this section is asfollows: (i) The premium (or discount) shall be determined in accordance with thissection; and (ii) The appropriate amortization of premium (or accrual of discount) at-tributable to the taxable year shall bean amount which bears the same ratio VerDate 11<MAY>2000 01:46 Apr 14, 2001 Jkt 194087 PO 00000 Frm 00635 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\194087T.XXX pfrm08 PsN: 194087T
