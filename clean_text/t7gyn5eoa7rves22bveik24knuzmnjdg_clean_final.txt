Rooney’s Livestock Subcommittee Hears from Florida Cattleman on State of Beef Industry Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney (FL-16), Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry, today heard testimony from Jim Strickland, a livestock producer and President of the Florida Cattlemen’s Association, during a hearing today on the state of the beef industry. “Today’s hearing gave us a clearer picture of the economic situation and public policy challenges that our livestock producers face,” Rooney said. “Many federal regulations, regardless of how well-intentioned they might be, have unintended consequences that hurt our livestock producers, and today’s hearing shed some light on those effects. “I particularly appreciate Jim Strickland, who is a livestock producer and President of the Cattlemen’s Association in my home state of Florida, for coming to Washington to discuss the impact of federal laws and regulation on his business.” In his prepared testimony , Mr. Strickland discussed the impact of federal regulations like dust and numeric nutrient standards from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on livestock producers. He also urged Congress to enact pending trade agreements and permanently end the death tax. ### 1 / 1
