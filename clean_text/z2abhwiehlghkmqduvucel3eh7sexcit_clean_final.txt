CONGRESSMAN BACHUS: REPEAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE MANDATE WASHINGTON (June 15)– Congressman Spencer Bachus (AL-6) today voted to repeal a mandate in the federal health care takeover that will require Americans to buy government-approved health insurance. However, the measure failed on the House floor when the Democrat majority led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected it in a procedural vote. Congressman Bachus said, “From the beginning, I have said that this mandate is both unwise and unconstitutional. The federal government has no right telling Americans what kind of health insurance they must buy, especially when a plan requires coverage of abortion. It is my intention to fight this radical change to our health care system, and I will continue to advocate a reasoned approached of ‘repeal and replace’.” Bachus had earlier announced his support for a lawsuit filed by Alabama and 19 other states challenging the individual mandate as unconstitutional.
