Johnson Space Center Houston, Texas Four space walks highlight STS-82Hubble mission By Ed Campion The STS-82 astronauts are to arrive at Kennedy Space Centertoday as Discovery prepares to lift off on the second servicing missionto the orbiting Hubble SpaceTelescope. Commander Ken Bowersox, Pilot Scott Horowitz, and MissionSpecialists Mark Lee, GregHarbaugh, Steve Smith, Joe Tannerand Steve Hawley were to leaveEllington Field early Friday andspend the next few days in weatherand mission-related meetings. The official STS-82 countdown isto beginearly Saturday at 3 a.m.CST. At the FlightReadiness Review meet-ing on Jan. 30, NASAmanagers set Feb. 11 asthe official launch date forthe mission. The 65-minute launch windowopens at 2:56 a.m. CSTTuesday. Work at Launch Pad 39A this week included completionof payload integration and verifica-tion tests, cooling of the NearInfrared Camera and Multi-ObjectSpectrometer payload and closeoutof the aft compartment. In addition to standard pre-launch processing activities this week, KSCtechnicians also removed andreplaced the nozzle throat plugs onthe solid rocket boosters. The teamexamining the nozzle throat erosionissue asked for the plug changeoutto give engineers additional data ona batch of polysulfide material usedon some recent SRBs. The polysul-fide material may be a possible con-tributor to the unusual erosion pat-tern seen during two previousshuttle launches. Assuming an on-time launch on Feb. 11, Discovery will rendezvous with the orbiting telescope justbefore 2 a.m. CST on Feb. 13.When the shuttle is within 200 feetof the telescope, ground controllerswill command Hubble to perform aroll maneuver to position it for grap- pling. Hawley will use the robot armto grab the telescope and berth it in Discovery ’s cargo bay. Once the telescope is secure and power hastransferred to Discovery , Horowitz will maneuver the shuttle so thatHubble’s solar arrays face the sunand its internal batteries canrecharge. Beginning Thursday evening, the first of four space walks over foursuccessive days will be conducted. During the space walks, Lee, Harbaugh, Smith and Tanner will install two state-of-the-artinstruments that will signif-icantly upgrade the scien-tific capabilities of the tele-scope. They also willperform maintenance tokeep HUbble functioningsmoothly until the nextscheduled servicing mis-sion in 1999. Once the space walks are complete, ground con-trollers will turn on Hubble’s internal power and Hawley,who originally deployed Hubble onSTS-31 in April 1990, will releasethe orbiting observatory to continueits exploration of distant galaxies. Discovery ’s mission is planned for 9 days, 22 hours, 47 minutes. Thesecond shuttle mission of the yearwill conclude with a landing at KSCon Feb. 21 at about 1:43 a.m. CST. While Discovery is poised to begin its mission, processing work on theother shuttles supporting flight oper-ations also continues on schedule. Following installation of the Spacelab into Columbia last Friday, KSC technicians conducted integra-tion and verification tests on themodule. Securing of the three shut-tle main engines also was complet-ed. Current plans call for Columbia to be moved to the VehicleAssembly Bldg. on March 3 and tobe moved to the launch pad oneweek later. Columbia’s seven astro- nauts will fly on STS-83, a 16-daymicrogravity sciences flight1.STS-82 DISCOVERYSTS-82 Shannon, Thorson tosplit offices The Business and Information Systems Directorate once againwill become two separate direc-torates with Jim Shannon leadingthe business side and RichardThorson heading up informationsystems. Shannon will serve as actingdirector of thenew BusinessManagementDirectorate. Asthe director,Shannon willlead the cen-ter’s procure-ment andresourcesfunctions that previously were part of theBusiness and Information SystemsDirectorate. Shannon joined JSC in1962 and has held progressivelyresponsible positions in the MissionOperations Directorate over his 34-year career. After holding numer-ous managerial positions withinMOD, Shannon was appointed assistant direc-tor in 1989 andwas nameddeputy directorin 1995. Thorson will serve as actingdirector of thenew Informa-tion SystemsDirectorate. Asthe acting di-rector, Thorson will lead the center’s informationsystems and information technolo-gy programs that previously werepart of the Business andInformation Systems Directorate.He joined JSC in 1966 and hasheld numerous managerial posi-tions, including manager forIntegration for Space StationFreedom; deputy manager of theNational Space TransportationSystems Operations; manager ofthe Data Management and Opera-tions Office and most recently,deputy director of CenterOperations. Shannon Thorson Mir 22 Flight Engineer Jerry Linenger sent his greetings to partic-ipants in the Houston LivestockShow and Rodeo last week butspent most of the week diving intohis experiments on the Russian MirSpace Station and preparing for thearrival of the Mir 23 crew next week. “Welcome everybody to the Houston Livestock and Rodeoshow,” Linenger said. “It is going tobe a fantastic event and I wish Iwere down there right now to joiny’all. I know that there are more than10,000 volunteers that make theshow a success and so we want tosalute all those people that put in alltheir hard work, hard effort to makethe show a success every year. And,also to those volunteers at JSC. Iknow a lot of folks down there alsoget involved in the HoustonLivestock Show and Rodeo.” Linenger showed off his sheriff-in- space badge and hog socks androped a couple of aliens as he madedeputies of Commander ValeryKorzun and Flight Engineer Alexander Kaleri. The break in activities came after a busy four weeks on Mir, butLinenger said he is making himselfat home and enjoying his stay inspace. “So far it’s been a great experi- ence,” Linenger said last week dur-ing an interview with WDRV inDetroit. “I have been really busydoing some great science experi-ments, but also having an enjoyabletime getting use to a new environ-ment. The floating and those thingsthat most people associate withspace becomes second naturearound here and it feels like I am athome now. The minute I got intospace I felt very comfortable physi-cally. You just have to adjust a littlebit because everything is fingertipcontrol. You can’t go boundingaround or leaping or anything likethat, you just basically use your fin-gertips and push yourself in any JSC workers take buyoutadvantage A total of 113 employees took advantage of the latest NASA buyout program and left JSC to pursueother interests.
