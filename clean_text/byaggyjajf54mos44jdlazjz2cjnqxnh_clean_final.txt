Questions to ask Suppliers • Are there any deposit requirements? • Do you charge any early termination fees? If so, how much? • Do you charge any switching, membership or other fees? • Are you certified by the PUCO? • Is your rate fixed, or does it change? • If it is a variable rate, how does it change? • Is there a customer incentive for signing up? • Are there any built-in price increases or decreases? • Are there any special add-on services? • How long is the contract for this offer? • Does your service cover all months of the year? • What happens when my contract expires? • Will I receive one or two bills a month? Chart Definitions Ccf: One hundred cubic feet; a unit used to measure natural gas usage. Contract Term: The length or duration of the contract (i.e. monthly, yearly, multiple-year). County Sales Tax : When natural gas is purchased from a supplier, the natural gas is subject to Ohio sales or use tax. Because county sales tax rates vary throughout Ohio, the county sales tax is not included in the supplier’s total rate. Use the attached map to determine your county’s sales tax rate. Current Offer : Comprised of suppliers’ current commodity options and base rates, exclusive of sales tax, the local utility transportation charge, and cu stomer service charges. Commodity options may be a fixed, variable, or stable rate plan. Expected Gas Cost (EGC) : A component of the GCR, the EGC is the price the local utility expects to pay for natural gas in the upcoming GCR rate period. For example, if the GCR rate is filed on a mont hly basis, the local utility will calculate the EGC for the following month. Gas costs recoverable through the EGC include the cost of purchasing the gas itself as well as the cost of transporting the gas from the producing region to the local utility’s service territory through the interstate pipeline system. Fixed Rate Plan : A constant rate for the contracted period. Gas Cost Recovery (GCR) Rate : A mechanism that provides a dollar-for-do llar recovery of costs incurred by a local utility to purchase natural gas to its system. The GCR mechanism enables the local utility to correct any over or under collections of natural gas costs in previous periods. GCR Transition (GCRT) Rider : An adjustment used to reimburse or charge customers for any under or over recovery of previous year’s gas cost charges. Although all customers ar e assessed a transportation rate charge, following 12 month’s participation as a CHOICE customer, the GCR transition rider is el iminated from the customer’s bill. Because the GCR transition rider only impacts the transportation charges of CH OICE customers of less than 12 month's participation, the total rate is calculated with these customers in mind. Gross Receipts Tax : When natural gas is purchased from a local utility, it is not subjec t to Ohio sales or use tax. The local utility must pay a gross receipts excise tax which is included in the GCR rate charged for the natural gas based on the volume of gas consumed (per Ccf). Stable Rate Plan : A variable rate for a fixed period of time. Supplier Name: PUCO-certified suppliers that are actively enrolling new customers. Total Rate : Comprised of the supplier’s natural gas commodity prices, plus the transportation rate charge. Transportation Rate Charge : The transportation rate charge, which can fluctuate quarterly, is comprised of a base rate , transportation program cost, migration rider, Percentage of Income Payment Plan rider, excise tax rider, uncollectible expense rider, GCR transition rider, and gross receipts excise tax. Variable Rate Plan : A fluctuating rate within the contracted period. The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Ted Strickland, Governor  Alan R. Schriber, Chairman 180 E.
