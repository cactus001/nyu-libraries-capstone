11033 Federal Register / Vol. 69, No. 46 / Tuesday, March 9, 2004 / Notices [FR Doc. 04 –5200 Filed 3 –8–04; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4210 –27–P DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT [Docket No. FR –4922–N–01] Privacy Act of 1974; Notice of Matching Program: Matching Tenant Data in Assisted Housing Programs AGENCY: Office of the Chief Information Officer, HUD. ACTION: Notice of a computer matching program between the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). SUMMARY: Pursuant to the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, as amended, and the Office of Management and Budget ’s (OMB) Guidance on the statute, HUD is updating its notice of a matching program involving comparisons between income data provided by applicants or participants in HUD ’s assisted housing programs and independent sources of income information. The matching program will be carried out to detect inappropriate (excessive or insufficient) housing assistance under the National Housing Act, the United States Housing Act of 1937, section 101 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1965, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, and the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998. The program provides for the verification of the matching results and the initiation of appropriate administrative or legal actions, primarily through public housing agencies (HAs) and owners and agents (all collectively referred to as POAs). Indian tribes and tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs) are not a mandatory component of the computer matching program. Participation by Indian tribes and TDHEs is discretionary; however, they may receive and use social security and supplemental security income matching information provided by HUD. This notice provides an overview of computer matching for HUD ’s assisted housing programs. Specifically, the notice describes HUD ’s program for computer matching of its tenant data to: (a) The SSA ’s earned income and the IRS’s unearned income data, (b) SSA ’s wage, social security, supplemental security income and special veterans benefits data, (c) State Wage Information Collection Agencies ’ (SWICAs ’) wage and unemployment benefit claim information, and (d) the Office of Personnel Management ’s (OPM) personnel data. DATES: Effective Date: Computer matching is expected to begin on April 8, 2004, unless comments are received which will result in a contrary determination, or 40 days from the date a computer matching agreement is signed, whichever is later. Comments Due Date: April 8, 2004. ADDRESSES : Interested persons are invited to submit comments regarding this notice to the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410 –0500. Communications should refer to the above docket number and title. Facsimile (FAX) comments are not acceptable. A copy of each communication submitted will be available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : For Privacy Act: Jeanette Smith, Departmental Privacy Act Officer, Room P8001, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, telephone number (202) 708 –2374. A telecommunications device for hearing- and speech-impaired individuals (TTY) is available at 1 –800–877–8339 (Federal Information Relay Service). For further information from recipient agency: Elking Tarver, Project Manager, Tenant Assessment Sub-System, Real Estate Assessment Center, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 1280 Maryland Avenue, SW., Suite 800, Washington, DC 20024 –2635, telephone number (202) 708 –4932, extension 3235. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : This notice supersedes a similar notice published in the Federal Register on May 5, 2003 (68 FR 23753). Since that time, the matching program has been implemented on a large scale. In previous years, the computer matching was carried out for random samples of households receiving rental assistance or for selected POAs. During calendar year 1999, HUD used the matching program for a large-scale computer matching project involving over 2 million households. HUD announced plans for the large-scale implementation of the program in 64 FR 49817 (September 14, 1999). The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act (CMPPA) of 1988, an amendment to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), OMB ’s guidance on this statute entitled ‘‘Final Guidance Interpreting the Provisions of Public Law 100 –503, the CMPPA of 1988 ’’ (OMB Guidance), and OMB Circular No. A–130 requires publication of notices of computer matching programs. Appendix I to OMB ’s Revision of Circular No. A – 130, ‘‘Transmittal Memorandum No. 4, ’’ Management of Federal Information Resources, ’’ prescribes Federal agency responsibilities for maintaining records about individuals. In with the CMPPA and Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A – 130, copies of this notice are being provided to the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and OMB ’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. I. Authority This matching program is being conducted pursuant to sections 3003 and 13403 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103 – 66, approved August 10, 1993); section 542(b) of the 1998 Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 105 –65); section 904 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 3544); section 165 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (42 U.S.C. 3543); the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701 –1750g); the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 –1437z); section 101 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1965 (12 U.S.C. 1701s); the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 et seq. ); and the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(f)). The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Reconciliation Act) authorizes HUD to request from the SSA and the IRS Federal tax information as prescribed in section 6103(l)(7) of title 26 of the United States Code (Internal Revenue Code). Section 542(b) of HUD ’s 1998 Appropriation Act (Pub. L. 105 – 65; October 27, 1997) eliminated a September 30, 1998, sunset provision to 26 U.S.C. 6103(l)(7)(D)(ix) of the Internal Revenue Code, effectively making permanent the authority for SSA and IRS disclosures of federal tax information to HUD. The Federal tax information that HUD receives includes income data that individuals receive from employers and financial institutions ( e.g., income data that would be shown on IRS Form W – 2 and Form 1099) for use in preparing tax returns. The Budget Reconciliation Act prohibits HUD redisclosure of tax data to POAs. However, it allows HUD to disclose the fact that discrepancies VerDate jul<14>2003 17:14 Mar 08, 2004 Jkt 200001 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\09MRN1.SGM 09MRN1
