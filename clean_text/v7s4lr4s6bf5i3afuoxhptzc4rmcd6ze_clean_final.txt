Exhibit 300: FBI Data Integration and Visualization System (DIVS) (Revision 2) of 13 Exhibit 300: Capital Asset Plan and Business Case Summary Part I: Summary Information And Justification (All Capital Assets) Section A: Overview (All Capital Assets) Date of Submission: 3/26/2009 Agency: Department of Justice Bureau: Federal Bureau Of Investigation Name of this Capital Asset: FBI Data Integration and Visualization System (DIVS) Unique Project (Investment) Identifier: (For IT investment only, see section 53. For all other, use agency ID system.) 011-10-01-02-01-3372-00 What kind of investment will this be in FY 2010? (Please NOTE: Investments moving to O&M in FY 2010, with Planning/Acquisition activities prior to FY 2010 should not select O&M. These investments should indicate their current status.) Mixed Life Cycle What was the first budget year this investment was submitted to OMB? FY2010 Provide a brief summary and justification for this investment, including a brief description of how this closes in part or in whole an identified agency performance gap: FBI DIVS employs leading edge technologies in on-going operations. DIVS provides the front end tools to access stored intercepted electonic surveillance data and seized electronic data. DIVS also processes ca ptured and seized media and makes the data suitable for analysis. DIVS marries the capabilities of the FBI Data Loading and Analysis System (DaLAS) and the FBI Electronic Surveillance Data Management System (EDMS). Program back end software applications convert ingested data into searchable formats. DIVS front end program analytical software applications provide the FBI and the Intelligence Community with a protected, but accessible environment for the timely extraction of valuable data relationships not discoverable using manual and previously available automated techniques. Security and privacy issues are major cost drivers due to the nature of system data content, data accession, end uses, and importance to homeland security. The FBI Special Technologies and Applications Office (STAO), which manages DIVS, intends to provide a single user experience with a single set of search tools, availabl e as web-based applications on the DIVS portal. This should simplify and reduce the costs for future maintanance and improvement activities and reduce training requirements for users. This investment covers changes to the front end to pr ovide a single sign-on capability with portal access to all stored data plus a single set of analytic al software application to assist agents and analysts with discovering meaningful information to counter terrorism and crim inal activities. The DIVS initiative does not address or close any FBI performance gaps. DaLAS and EDMS succ essfully addressed those ga ps in prior years. DIVS will improve existing services and speed the user's capability to analyze a rapidly gr owing ocean of data to find data relationships that directly contribute to national security. Did the Agency's Executive/Investment Committee approve this request? No a. If "yes," what was the date of this approval? Did the Project Manager review this Exhibit? Yes Contact information of Program/Project Manager? Name Phone Number Email a. What is the current FAC-P/PM (for civilian agencies) or DAWIA (for defense agencies) certification level of the program/project manager? New Program Manager b. When was the Program/Project Manager Assigned? 2/17/2008 c. What date did the Progra m/Project Manager receive the FAC-P/PM certification? If the certification has not been issued, what is the anticipated date for certification? 4/8/2009 Has the agency developed and/or promoted cost No

Exhibit 300: FBI Data Integration and Visualization System (DIVS) (Revision 2) of 13 2. If earned value is not required or will not be a contract re quirement for any of the contracts or task orders above, explain why: Contracts 1 and 2 were exte nsions of existing task orders to acquire O&M labor to support EDMS . This labor provides continuity of technical expertise during the synchr onization of EDMS and DWS to ensure continuous operational support during the transition. Contract 3 is the FFRDC task order to provide high end sk illed engineers and scientists to extend STAO operational capabilities using cutting edge technologies. There are no produc t deliverables or basis for EVM on this task order. Contract s 4 and 5 are task orders to acquire O&M and other technical services to perform work, as required, for operational support of DaLAS and EDMS and to extend their capabili ties within operating budget constraints. Contracts 3, 4, and 5 also provide skille d technical labor to process seized media and intercepted data for exploitation by system users. Contracts 6-17 have a global or combined ceiling across all 12 contracts to provide services and products to su pport FBI Science and Technology Branch activities. Specific application to DIVS is to be determined. The government serves as the DIVS program integrator. No singl e contract or task or contractor has or will be awarded specifica lly to develop the DIVS portal an d single analytical application toolset and data baseDevelopment work must be done without inte rference to on-going analysis an d investigations. Hence, EVM would be difficult, if not imposs ible, to measure progress against plan since an y plan is subject to real world interruptions. Do the contracts ensure Section 508 compliance? N/A a. Explain why not or how this is being done? This is a National Security System associated with intelligence activities. Is there an acquisition plan which reflects th e requirements of FAR Subpart 7.1 and has been approved in accordance with agency requirements? Yes a. If "yes," what is the date? 8/6/2007 Is it Current? Yes b. If "no," will an acquisition plan be developed? If "no," briefly explain why: Section D: Performance Information (All Capital Assets) In order to successfully address this area of the exhibit 300, performance goals must be provided for the agency and be linked to the annual performance plan. The inve stment must discuss the agency's mission and strategic goals, and performance measures (indicators) must be provided. These goals need to map to the gap in the agency's stra tegic goals and objectives this investment is designed to fill. They are the internal and extern al performance benefits this inve stment is expected to deliver to the agency (e.g., improve efficiency by 60 percent, increase citizen participation by 300 percent a year to achieve an overall citizen participation rate of 75 percent by FY 2xxx, etc.). The goals must be clearly measurable investment outcomes, and if applicable, investment outputs. They do not include the completion date of the module, milestones, or investment, or general goals, such as, significant, better, improved that do not have a quantitative or qualitative measure. Agencies must use the following table to report performance goals and measures for the major inve stment and use the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Performance Reference Model (PRM). Map all Measur ement Indicators to the corresponding "Measurement Area" and "Measurement Grouping" identified in the PRM. There should be at least one Measurement Indicator for each of the four different Measurement Areas (for each fisc al year). The PRM is available at www.egov.gov. The table can be extended to include performance measures fo r years beyond the next President's Budget.

Systems supporting this investment on the planning and operational systems security tables should match the systems on the privacy table below. Sy stems on the Operational Security Table must be included on your agency FISMA system inventory and sh ould be easily referenced in the inventory (i.e., shou ld use the same name or identifier). For existing Mixed-Life Cycle investments where enhancement, development, and/or modernization is planned, include the investment in both the "Systems in Planning" table (Table 3) and the "Operational Systems" table (Table 4). Systems which are already operational, but have enhancement, development, and/or modernization activity, should be included in both Table 3 and Table 4. Table 3 should reflect the planned date for the system changes to be complete and operational, and the planned date for the associated C&A update. Table 4 should reflect the current status of the requirements listed. In this context, informati on contained within Table 3 should characterize what updates to testing and documentation will occur before implementing the enhancements; and Table 4 should characterize the current state of the materials associated with the existing system. All systems listed in the two security tables should be identifi ed in the privacy table. The list of systems in the "Name of Sy stem" column of the privacy table (Table 8) should match the systems li sted in columns titled "Name of System" in the security tables (Tables 3 and 4). For the Privacy table, it is possible that there may not be a one-to-one ratio between the list of systems an d the related privacy documents. For example, one PIA could cover mu ltiple systems. If this is the case, a working link to the PI A may be listed in column (d) of the privacy table more than once (for each system covered by the PIA).

--- Page 6 ---
Exhibit 300: FBI Data Integration and Visualization System (DIVS) (Revision 2) of 13 The questions asking whether there is a PIA which covers the system and whether a SORN is required for the system are discrete from the narrative fields. The narrative column provides an opportunity for free text explanation why a working link i s not provided. For example, a SORN may be required for the system , but the system is not yet operational. In this circumstance, answer "yes" for column (e) and in the narrative in column (f), explain that because the system is not operational the SORN is not yet required to be published. Please respond to the questions below and verify the system owner took the following actions: Have the IT security costs for the system(s) been identified and integrated into the overall costs of the investment?: a. If "yes," provide th e "Percentage IT Security" for the budget year: Is identifying and assessing se curity and privacy risks a part of the overall risk management effort for each system supporting or part of this investment?

Exhibit 300: FBI Data Integration and Visualization System (DIVS) (Revision 2) of 13 Exhibit 300: Part II: Planning, Acquisition and Performance Information Section A: Alternatives Analysis (All Capital Assets) Part II should be completed only for investments identified as "Planning" or "Full Acquisition," or "Mixed Life-Cycle" investme nts in response to Question 6 in Part I, Section A above. In selecting the best capital asset, you should identify and consider at least three viable alternatives, in addition to the cu rrent baseline, i.e., the status quo. Use OMB Circular A-94 for all investments and the Clinger Cohen Act of 1996 for IT investments to determine the criteria you should use in your Benefit/Cost Analysis. Did you conduct an alternatives analysis for this project? Yes a. If "yes," provide th e date the analysis was completed? 8/29/2008 b. If "no," what is the an ticipated date this analysis will be completed? c. If no analysis is planned, please briefly explain why: Alternative Analysis Results: Use the results of your alternatives analysis to complete the following table: * Costs in millions Alternative Analyzed Description of Alternative Risk Adjusted Lifecycle Costs estimate Risk Adjusted Lifecycle Benefits estimate Alternative 2--develop portal, single sign-on, and single application tool setImplement the DIVS portal with single sign-on and a single user experience and tool suite 65 93.19 Which alternative was selected by the Agency's Executive/Investment Committee and why was it chosen? The performance and cost benefits of Altern ative 2 are very attractive both for STAO and DIVS users--less training and better opportunities to "connect the dots." Port al preparation and single application work can proceed under Alternative 2 concurrent with legal review. Also, the in-house team can continually improve DaLAS and EDMS capabi lities using people already intimately familiar with their inter-workings. a. What year will the investment breakeven? (Specifically, when the budgeted costs savings exceed the cumulative costs.) What specific qualitative benefits will be realized? FBI DIVS is a suite of integrated tools designed for both investigators and intelligence analysts to view stored and processed electronic surveillance data. DIVS improvements are aimed at in creasing search and relationship discovery speed or deriving useable and searchable data from captured or seized media that can lead to the development of intelligence products or the capture of people breaking U.S. laws or threatening U.S. citizens and interests. DIVS provides the FBI and the Intelligence Community with a significant and effective capability for intelligence analysis, counterterrorism, and criminal investigations. Alternative 2 will free up technical labor to accelerate the instantiation of new tools in the future, free personnel to expand outreach and training opportunities, while at the same time reducing training needs for the STAO user community. The most important benefits will be the im proved user experience when searching all STAO stored electronic surveillance and seized data with the potential for improved intelligence, counter-intelligence, counter-terrorism, and criminal investigation capabilities. This has the benefit of improving the automated correlation of se ized digital media and intercep ted surveillance data between previously unrelated terrorism and counteri ntelligence cases. The real value is th e increased potential to uncover terrorist activities and prevent catastroph ic loss of property and life. Federal Quantitative Benefits What specific quantitative benefits will be realized (using curr ent dollars) Use the results of your alternatives analysis to c omplete the following table: Budgeted Cost Savings Cost Avoidance Justification for Budgeted Cost Savings Justification for Budgeted Cost Avoidance PY - 1 2007 & Prior 0 0 PY 2008 0 0 N/A--single application not available until FY 2011 Prior year costs not tracked against DIVS CY 2009 0 0 N/A--single application not available until FY 2011 Planning and initial investment year BY 2010 0 0 N/A--single application not available until FY 2011 Investment year Total LCC Benefit LCC = Life-cycle Cost

Exhibit 300: FBI Data Integration and Visualization System (DIVS) (Revision 2) of 13 6. Will the selected alternative replace a legacy system in-part or in-whole? No a. If "yes," are the mi gration costs associated with the migration to the selected alternative included in this investment, the legacy investment, or in a separate migration investment? b. If "yes," please provide the following information: 5b. List of Legacy Investment or Systems Name of the Legacy Investment of Systems UPI if available Date of the System Retirement Section B: Risk Management (All Capital Assets) You should have performed a risk assessment during the early pl anning and initial concept phase of this investment's life-cycle , developed a risk-adjusted life-cycl e cost estimate and a plan to eliminate, mitigate or manage risk, and be actively managing risk throughout the in vestment's life-cycle. Does the investment have a Risk Management Plan? Yes a. If "yes," what is the date of the plan? 8/1/2008 b. Has the Risk Management Plan been significantly changed since last year's submission to OMB? Yes c. If "yes," describe any significant changes: The FISA Court mandate added new risks to the previously used DaLAS, EDMS, and DW S risk registries since all DIVS stored data and applications are affected. In a ddition, EDMS was transferred from the Office of Technolo gy Development (OTD) to the Special Technologies and Applications Office (STAO) in 2008 as pa rt of the consolidation effort. The primary risk is schedule since the court requires compliance with "Standard Minimization Procedures" (SMP) by November 1, 2008. A second major risk is the coordination between the two legacy teams accomplishin g the work. A new program le vel Risk Management Plan was approved on August 1, 2008. Risk registries for DaLAS and th e EDMS/DWS merger are being maintained. Risk registries for smaller projects and incremental releases are also maintained. Detailed planning and risk assessments will be accomplished after SMP compliance is achieved. If there currently is no pl an, will a plan be developed? a. If "yes," what is the planned completion date? b. If "no," what is th e strategy for managing the risks? Briefly describe how investment risks are reflected in the life cycle cost estimate and investment schedule: The program operates using the STAO operating budget and no other separate funds. The pacing schedule item for DIVS activation is legal approval, which may require 12-18 months from request to deci sion. The request will go forward after SMP implementation. Single sign-on can be ready within six months of decision to go forward (technical estimate). Most of the wor k can be accomplished while the legal request is in process. Co nservatively, single sign-on coul d be available by 1 October 2009 ; the target date is based on a potential legal delay (March 1, 2010). The technology to instantiate the web page is state-of-th e- practice. The target web presentation is already mocked up an d plans are underway to determine a cost effective schedule to merge the EDMS, DWS, and DaLAS tool suites. The development team is intimately familiar with all system components and features of the three legacy tool suites. EDMS and DaLAS will converge to a si ngle application by the schedule milestone date. Section C: Cost and Schedule Performance (All Capital Assets) EVM is required only on DME portions of investments. For mixed lifecycle investments, O&M milestones should still be included in the table (Comparison of Initial Baseline and Current Approved Baseline). This table should accurately reflect the milestone s in the initial baseline, as well as milestones in the current baseline. Does the earned value management system meet the criteria in ANSI/EIA Standard-748? No Is the CV% or SV% greater than +/- 10%? (CV%= CV/EV x 100; SV%= SV/PV x 100) No a. If "yes," was it the CV or SV or both? b. If "yes," explain the causes of the variance: c. If "yes," describe the corrective actions: Has the investment re-baselin ed during the past fiscal year? No a. If "yes," when was it approved by the agency head?

Exhibit 300: FBI Data Integration and Visualization System (DIVS) (Revision 2) of 13 4. Comparison of Initial Baseline and Current Approved Baseline Complete the following table to compare actual performance against the current performance baseline and to the initial performa nce baseline. In the Current Baseline section, for all milestones listed, you should provide both the baseline and actual completion dates (e.g., "03/23/2003"/ "04/28/2004") and the baseline and actual total costs (in $ Millions). In the event that a milestone is not found in both the initial and current baseline, leave the associated cells blank. Note tha t the 'Description of Milest one' and 'Percent Complete' fields are required. Indicate '0' fo r any milestone no longer active.
