Trusting Spirit Rescues Horses, aided by South Douglas CDTuesday, 04 March 2008 Abandoned horses in Douglas County have a friend, or, as some might say, a guardian angel, in the form of Claudia Trapp, of Orondo, Washington. Claudia has created Trusting Spirit Horse Rescue, a non-profit organization aimed at caring for neglected and unwanted horses. She currently has 24 horses at her farm in Orondo, many who came from one owner who could no longer care for them. Claudia and other volunteers nurse the horses back to health and then seek good matches for those ready to move on to a new home. To meet the need for a horse rescue in North Central Washington, Claudia and her husband, Larry, removed orchard trees that were no longer productive, and used the space to begin developing corrals and shelters. Much of the work is done by volunteers who care for the horses, help build lean-tos, and provide compassionate human contact for these neglected animals. A great partner for Trusting Spirit is the South Douglas Conservation District. This coming spring, the South Douglas Conservation District will provide technical assistance and cost-share funds to help Claudia renovate and seed her pasture, cross fence for better pasture management, change from orchard hand lines to pastureland irrigation, plant a windbreak, and develop a livestock confinement area. Like all 47 conservation districts in Washington State, the South Douglas Conservation District assists private landowners with their voluntary conservation projects.
