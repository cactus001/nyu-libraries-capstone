Changes in Procedural Regulations Help to Streamline Appeals Before HAC by Glenna Sheveland Alan LeBovidge Commissioner Gerard D. Perry Deputy CommissionerA Publication of the Department of Revenue’s Division of Local ServicesCityandTown Volume 18, No. 8 September 2005 HAC Implements Changes to its Regulatory Procedures Effective July 2, 2004, the Housing Ap- peals Committee (HAC) began imple-mentation of new procedural ruleswhich allowed for, among other things,a motion practice and the use of pre-filed testimony. These procedural re-forms were implemented as an affirma-tive step towards reducing the backlogof housing development proposalspending before the HAC. Background The Massachusetts ComprehensivePermit Law (M.G.L. Chapter 40B, Secs.20–23) was enacted in 1969 to promotethe construction of low- and moderate-income housing. The law envisions thatmunicipalities will work with developersto create affordable housing for individ-uals who would otherwise not be ableto afford such an opportunity. The Com-prehensive Permit Law also allows foran expedited administrative appeal tothe HAC whenever a comprehensivepermit is denied by a municipality orgranted with conditions that might ren-der construction of the proposed hous-ing uneconomic and therefore imprac-tical to build. A decrease in available buildable land, an increase in restrictive local regula-tions, and most importantly, a changein the availability of qualifying fundingsources, have all led to an intensifiedinterest by developers in the use of thecomprehensive permit process as ameans by which to develop new hous-ing throughout the Commonwealth.This increased demand for compre-hensive permits in turn had resulted ina backlog of appeals before the HAC. To determine ways in which the appealprocess could be expedited, an Advi-sory Committee was formed in Augustof 2003, to review and recommendchanges to the procedural process thathad been in use, for the most part, byHAC since its inception in 1969. TheAdvisory Committee identified severaladministrative and procedural changesthat it believed would substantially im-prove the appeal process before theHAC. The most significant changes pro-posed included an increase in staffingfor the HAC, encouraging voluntarysettlement between the parties, andchanges in the procedural regulationsto include a motion practice and theuse of prefiled testimony. Addition of a Motion Practice Although not yet quantified, it is be-lieved that the expansion of the motionpractice has had an unexpected im-pact on the comprehensive permit ap-peal process. In fact, it is currently sug-gested that the motion practice hashad the effect of promoting voluntarysettlement through the early resolutionof issues that are either purely proce-dural considerations or are based onpreviously resolved substantive issuesof law. Although motions can be madeorally, under the new procedures theyare usually made in writing. The prac-tice also allows the parties to request ahearing on the motion, which may beheld at the discretion of the presidingofficer. The hearing officer may alsodecide to deny the motion without prej-udice or wait to decide the motion untilcompletion of the hearing in the interestof expediting the hearing on the merits.Preliminary motions must be made within 30 days after the initial confer-ence of counsel. Municipalities shouldlook closely at the types of preliminarymotions available under 760 CMR30.07, as they are predominately mo-tions that a municipality would chooseto make. For example, a preliminarymotion may be made by the municipal-ity to dismiss the appeal for failure ofthe developer to meet the eligibility re-quirements for approval of a compre-hensive permit, or the municipality maybe able to show that it has met one ofthe statutorily defined minimal require-ments for affordable housing, or themunicipality may show that the devel-oper had attempted to file for a com-prehensive permit within 12 months ofhaving been denied or having volun-tarily withdrawn a request for variance,special permit, or subdivision approvalfor the same piece of property and thatthe prior proposal included no signifi-cant amount of low- or moderate- continued on page eight Inside This Issue From the Deputy Commissioner . . . . . . . . . . . 2 Legal Municipal Collective Bargaining Requestfor Funding Obligations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 Focus FY05 Average Single-Family Tax Billsand Assessed Values . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 Procurement of Banking Services . . . . . . . . . . . 7DLS Update Graziano and Sandell Earn Designation. . . . . . . 9Schedule A Reminder . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9Municipal Job Duties Online . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9 DLS Profile . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 State Revenues Eclipse Expectations by $436 Million in FY05 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10

board recommended the contingent budget, but indicated that if the bal-anced budget were adopted, $725,000would have to be reallocated from otherdepartments to the fire department tomeet the minimum staffing obligation. The union sought an injunction, pur- suant to Billerica v. International Asso- ciation of Firefighters, Local 1495 , 415 Mass. 692 (1993), to require an uncon-ditional appropriation request. A supe-rior court judge so ordered and thetown complied, but appealed the deci-sion. The town voted to fund the provi-sion, but also voted the override. Theunion requested the case be dismissedas moot, but the SJC agreed to a reviewto decide the issue as one that wouldbe likely to recur and was in need ofclarification. The SJC held that the contingent appro- priation request was not a good faithrequest to fully fund the contract. Themajority reviewed the preceding caselaw concerning minimum staffing pro-visions, which had held they were sub-ject to annual appropriation. Billerica, supra & Boston Teacher’s Union, Local 66 v. Boston , 382 Mass. 553 (1981) & 386 Mass. 197 (1982). Nevertheless, insuch circumstances the town executiveofficers are required to request fundingof the minimum staffing provisions andto support the request, citing severalMassachusetts Labor Relations Com-mission decisions. The SJC majority ruled that nothing in M.G.L. Ch. 59, Sec. 21C(m) authorizesthe board of selectmen to submit a bud-get contingent on an override and thatit is town meeting that may make suchcontingent appropriations. However,the majority did acknowledge the roleof the finance committee in makingbudget recommendations. The majorityalso found that although M.G.L. Ch. 59,Sec. 21C(m) was not listed in M.G.L.Municipal Collective Bargaining Requestfor FundingObligations by Gary A. Blau In the case of Local 1652, International Association of Firefighters v. Town of Framingham , 442 Mass 463 (2004), the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) ruledthat the town bargaining representa-tives’ request for funding an executedcollective bargaining agreement couldnot be made contingent upon the pas-sage of a Proposition 2 1⁄2override. In this 4–3 decision, the majority ruled thatthe collective bargaining law, M.G.L.Ch. 150E, Sec. 7(b) required that whenan agreement was reached between aunion and the town’s chief executive of-ficers, those officers must submit anunconditional request for funding to thelegislative body. The facts of the case are straightfor- ward. The town and firefighters’ unionentered into a collective bargainingagreement for July 1, 2000 throughJune 30, 2003, which included a mini-mum staffing provision requiring 30 fire-fighters per shift. In FY02, the secondyear of the contract, a 7 percent bud-get shortfall was projected. The townmanager and board of selectmen pro-posed a budget requesting funds tocover the minimum staffing provision(and to restore all projected budgetcuts), but made the funding vote con-tingent on the passage of an overrideunder M.G.L. Ch. 59, Sec. 21C(m). Al-ternatively, the manager and selectmenproposed a balanced budget within thetown’s levy limit under M.G.L. Ch. 59,Sec. 21C (Proposition 2 1⁄2), which would cut all town departments by 7percent and therefore would not be suf-ficient to fund the minimum staffing pro-vision as proposed. The manager andCity & Town September 2005 Division of Local Services 2 From the Deputy Commissioner During the certifi- cation process theBureau of LocalAssessment hasnoticed that someassessors do not make valuation changes as a resultof issues revealed during the publicdisclosure process. Some assessorsactually discourage taxpayers fromreporting valuation matters until theabatement process. The Division of Local Services dis- courages these practices becausewe believe they are shortsighted.Waiting for the abatement processto act is problematic for two reasons.First, an early review of taxpayer’scomplaints can lead to the revelationof a systemic valuation problem. If itis not corrected as a result of the dis-closure period then only complainingtaxpayers who file abatements canbe remedied while all other taxpayerswith comparable problems are notafforded similar treatment. Second,making changes during the disclo-sure process does not affect overlaybalances. Waiting until the tax ratehas been set wastes money onabatements that could be used forproductive community purposes. Consequently, if the Bureau feels that insufficient time or attention has beengiven to the disclosure process,including not making the requisitechanges prior to tax rate setting, it willinsist that assessors rectify the prob-lem prior to final certification. Asses-sors are encouraged to review thepublic disclosure section of the Guide- lines for Development of a Minimum Reassessment Program on pages 18–19 for compliance. Gerard D.

City & Town September 2005 Division of Local Services 3 FY05 Average Single- Family Tax Bills andAssessed Values by Scott Dressel This Focus article reviews fiscal year 2005 single-family tax bills and propertyvalues across the Commonwealth. As inprevious years, this article ranks com-munities statewide. It also highlightssome major trends and discusses theimpact on single-family tax bills. Theanalyses are based on FY05 data re-ported to the Department of Revenue’sDivision of Local Services (DLS) by thelocal assessors. Average single-family tax bills are cal- culated by summing the assessedvalue of all of the single-family parcelsof each community. Dividing this totalby the number of parcels results in theaverage single-family property value.The average value is divided by onethousand and then multiplied by theresidential tax rate. The 11 cities and towns that have adopted a residential exemption arenot included in this analysis becausethey do not submit sufficiently detailed data to DLS to determine their averagetax bills. Two communities (Hancockand Wendell) had not set tax rates atthe time this article was written. There-fore, they were excluded from the analy-sis as well. Statewide Trends Over each of the past 10 years, the av-erage single-family tax bill has in-creased in both constant and actualdollars ( see Figure 2 ). In actual dollars, the annual increase over the prioryear’s tax bill has ranged from 3.8 per-cent in 1999 to 6.7 percent in 2002. In2005, the average bill increased by 5.2percent. This trend has continued evenas the average single-family tax rateacross the Commonwealth has de-creased in each of the past sevenyears from a high of $14.92 per $1,000in 1998 to $10.17 per $1,000 in 2005.Much of the increase in the average billis attributable to rising residential as-sessed values, stagnant growth in thecommercial and industrial sectors, andrelatively flat state aid budgets. The average single-family property value realized a double-digit increase Figure 1for the fifth consecutive year. In 2005,the average value increased by 14.8percent, from $307,361 to $352,911.Even in constant dollar terms, the in-crease reached 11.7 percent ( see Fig- ure 3 ). Furthermore, the share of the total tax burden borne by residential propertyowners has increased in each of thepast five years, from 67.9 percent in1999 to 72.1 percent in 2005. This ismainly due to the fact that commercial,industrial, and personal (CIP) propertyvalues have not kept pace with the in-creasing residential values. It also re-flects the rollback of Chapter 3 of theActs of 2004. Several “split rate” communities adopted Chapter 3 of the Acts of 2004,temporarily allowing them to increasethe amount by which they shift the taxburden to CIP taxpayers. Before thisprovision, these communities were re-stricted from taxing CIP properties morethan 175 percent of the taxes theywould have paid under a single rate.The provision temporarily increased thislimit to 200 percent but started to roll itback in 2005. By 2009 the communitiesthat adopted the increased shift will beallowed a maximum CIP percentage of170, down from the preexisting 175.This will likely add to the weight of thetax burden on residential taxpayers inthese communities. Aggregate state aid across the Com- monwealth increased from about $4.81billion in 2004 to $4.95 billion in 2005.As far back as 2002, the figure wasabout $5.13 billion. Clearly, state aidhas not kept pace with 2002 growingcosts and services. This puts pressureon cities and towns to cover their ex-panding needs through using unusedlevy capacity or pursuing overrides. One factor that mitigated the rate of in- crease in the average tax bill was a de-Focus on Municipal Finance Tax Bill (in dollars) 500–1,900 (24)1,900–2,600 (75)2,600–3,300 (96)3,300–5,200 (98)5,200–11,800 (46) Excludes communities with Residential Exemptions FY2005 Average Single Family Tax Bill continued on page six

City & Town September 2005 Division of Local Services 6 crease in the passage of Proposition 21⁄2 overrides and capital exclusions. In FY04, communities passed overridesand capital exclusions that totaled$41.8 million. In FY05, the total was$30.5 million. This was the second yearin a row with such a decrease. Debt excluded under Proposition 2 1⁄2 increased slightly in FY05. Statewide, the amount of excluded debt only wentup from about $313.9 million in 2004 to$314.6 million in 2005. However, duringthe four year period from 2002 to 2005,the amount jumped by more than 17percent. Excluded debt service addsto the maximum allowable levy forcities and towns and therefore directlyimpacts the tax bill. Community Trends Table 1 shows the average single-family tax bill and average assessed value forall 338 communities in the study. It com-pares these figures to those of FY04and it ranks the communities from highto low for the FY05 tax bill. The five communities with the highest average tax bills in FY04 retained theirrankings in FY05. They are: Weston($11,767), Sherborn ($9,889), Lincoln($9,730), Carlisle ($9,224), and Dover($9,004). Not surprisingly, these townsalso all ranked among the highest withrespect to average assessed propertyvalue. The five communities with thelowest tax bills also remained un-changed: Rowe ($512), Erving ($908),Florida ($940), Tolland ($1,040), andMonroe ($1,106). These towns are allin the lower 20 percent of average as-sessed values. Statewide, the correla-tion between the average tax bill andaverage assessed value is generallystrong with a few exceptions. For ex-ample, communities on the Cape andIslands tend to have high assessedvalues but lower tax bills due to thelarge number of seasonal propertieswhose residents have a lower demandfor services. An even stronger correla-tion exists between average householdincome and average tax bill.

City & Town September 2005 Division of Local Services 7 Procurement of Banking Services Massachusetts Office of the Inspector General The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has issued Banking Services Procurement Guide for Local Govern- ment Treasurers to clarify the pro- curement rules for obtaining bankingservices. The guide provides a briefoverview of M.G.L. Ch. 30B, providesrecommendations for banking serviceprocurement, and identifies resourcesfor local officials. The Commonwealth’s cities and towns may obtain a wide range of servicesfrom banking institutions including col-lection services, depository accountservices, disbursement services, creditservices and investment services. Chapter 30B, the Uniform Procurement Act, establishes procedures that mostlocal government jurisdictions must fol-low for the acquisition and dispositionof supplies, equipment, services, andreal property. Chapter 30B requires a competitive procurement process using an Invita-tion for Bids or Request for Proposalsfor banking service contracts estimatedto cost $25,000 or more. For contractsestimated to cost less than $25,000,but more than $5,000, Chapter 30B re-quires three price quotations. Contracts costing $5,000 or less must be enteredinto using sound business practices. There are seven exemptions to Chapter 30B that are relevant to municipal trea-surers. For example, banking servicesobtained under a compensating bal-ance agreement are governed byM.G.L. Ch. 44, Section 53F and there-fore exempt from Chapter 30B. The De-partment of Revenue, Division of LocalServices, Bureau of Accounts is respon-sible for the interpretation and enforce-ment of the compensating balance law. Additionally, the issuance of bonds, notes, or securities is exempt fromChapter 30B. The following servicescan safely be considered to be a partof a bond issuance: structuring of thematurity schedule; preparation of theofficial statement; verifying legal docu-ments; the acquisition of a credit rating;the obtaining of approval from govern-ment agencies; the advertisement ofthe proposed sale; the distribution ofthe official statement to potential bid-ders; and the filing of initial and annualdisclosure documents with federal andstate regulatory agencies. Numerous recommendations are pro- vided in the guide for jurisdictions tofollow for all banking service procure-ments and contracts. For example, theOIG recommends that all banking serv- ices be procured competitively. Havingbanks compete over a municipality’sbusiness allows a treasurer to assesswhat is available and ensures that themunicipality is getting the best value. Additionally, the need to re-procure services prompts a review of the needfor those services and the quality of theservices currently being received. This Office recommends that munici- palities always enter into written agree- ments or contracts for banking serv-ices. A written agreement, contract, orany written documentation between amunicipality and a bank can ensure thatthe municipality is fully complying withpublic records requirements as well asmeeting the responsibility of soundbusiness practices. Finally, the OIG recommends that trea- surers consider the protection of thetaxpayer’s money. When taking a riskwith taxpayers’ money, it is imperativethat the risk be an educated one. There-fore, treasurers should conduct a thor-ough review of the qualifications, expe-rience, and expertise of any financial/investment advisor and/or consultant.

In FY05, 11 communities experienced increases in their average tax bills thatwere greater than 15 percent (rangingfrom 15.3 percent to 28.1 percent). Allbut one of these communities also sawtheir average assessed values increaseby at least 10 percent. Four of theeleven successfully passed Proposition2 1⁄2overrides. While all but five communities across the state experienced increases in theaverage assessed value, the magni-tude of the changes varied dramaticallyin 2005. There were 64 cities and towns in which the average value increasedby less than 5 percent. However, of the148 communities that had increasesabove the statewide average (14.8 per-cent), 56 communities had increasesgreater than 30 percent. Of these, 15were greater than 50 percent. Swansea,Royalston, and Stockbridge each ex-perienced increases above 70 percent. Further analysis of the average as- sessed values show a correlation toDLS’ community recertification sched-ule. All but six of the 56 communitieswith value increases over 30 percentjust completed a triennial recertificationin 2005. Only one of the 64 communi- ties with increases under 5 percent hada recertification in 2005. Of the citiesand towns below the statewide increaseaverage, 82 percent were also non-certification communities. These figuresreflect the fact that leading up to 2005,several communities were not yet per-forming interim year adjustments to val-ues. Now that interim year adjustmentsare required for all communities, suchsudden and uneven jumps in averageassessed value should not occur asfrequently. ■ FY05 Average Single-Family Tax Bills and Assessed Values continued from page six

Either party may also submit a motion for summary decision at any time priorto the conclusion of the formal hearingproceedings. This may be done with orwithout supporting affidavits or memo-randum of law. The motion may requestthat the hearing officer decide all oronly part of the issues in dispute. Theamount of time necessary for the HACto render a decision on summary deci-sion varies based on the nature andnumber of arguments presented andwhether the decision will be dispositiveof the entire appeal, which might requirereview and a vote by the full Committee. The Use of Prefiled Direct Testimony In addition to the use of the motionspractice, prefiled testimony reducesthe amount of time needed for disposi-tion of an appeal by limiting the hear-ing to cross-examination on the issuesestablished as part of the prefiled testi-mony. However, this procedure is notnecessarily appropriate for all cases.Occasionally the presiding officer maydetermine that it is more appropriate torequire that all of the testimony in a par-ticular case be oral testimony. Dead-lines for prefiled testimony are estab-lished by HAC Standing Order No.04-02, which directs that the prefiledtestimony of both parties be completedwithin 16 weeks from the date of theprehearing conference. Witnesses whose testimony is prefiled will be re-quired to appear for cross-examinationduring the hearing, unless the partiesagree otherwise. All cross-examinationwill now normally be completed on con-secutive days, which will also aid in ex-pediting the hearing process. In con-junction with the prefiled testimony, aparty may make a motion for directeddecision in its favor after the submissionof prefiled testimony, on the groundsthat upon the facts or the law the non-moving party has failed to prove a ma-terial element of its case or defense. Promoting Affordable Housing Since its enactment, the Comprehen-sive Permit Law has been an effectivemeans by which to ensure the contin-ued construction of affordable housing.It has been estimated that this law hasresulted in the development of morethan 30,000 housing units in approxi-mately 200 Massachusetts cities andtowns. The changes in procedure dis-cussed herein have resulted both in adecrease in the amount of time neededto resolve an appeal and also appearto be promoting the resolution of casesthrough voluntary settlement.

M.G.L. Ch. 59,Sec. 21C(m) is not a statute dealingwith terms and conditions of employ-ment, but is a provision intended to au-thorize appropriations contingent on aballot vote to override the tax levy limitsimposed by law. The town cited severalcases that said the labor relations com-mission would not dictate the fundingsource of an appropriation request, butin all the cases the commission had re-quired the towns to submit a full fund-ing request. The dissent emphasized that contingent appropriations had become a regulartool in the budgeting process and thatit could be harmonized with chapter150E. Justice Sosman pointed out thatmany appropriations required stepsfrom other parties before they might befinalized, and a Proposition 2 1⁄2contin- gent request was merely one such ap-propriation. The dissent further sug-gested that eliminating this provisionmight make more executive officers re-luctant to agree to minimum staffingprovisions in the future. It pointed outthat in this case there was no claimthat the executive officers did not fullysupport the appropriation and theoverride vote. Finally, while the case does require the executive officers to place a non-con-tingent article on the warrant to fund aminimum staffing provision, it did notrequire the town meeting to take a non-contingent vote. The finance committeestill appears free to move that the votebe made contingent on passage of anoverride, as well as any town citizen,and town meeting could so vote. ■HAC Appeals continued from page one Legal continued from page two

City & Town September 2005 Division of Local Services 10 DLS Profile: Executive Director, Springfield Finance Control Board In July 2004 the governor and the state Legislature established a Finance Control Board to oversee theoperations of the City of Springfield. What was esti-mated at that time to be a budget deficit of $22 mil-lion for FY05 was discovered, after the initial reviewof the city’s financial accounts, to be $41 million. With 13 years of senior executive experience, Philip Puccia was hired by the control board in August 2004 to turn around Springfield’s fortunes. Beforecoming to the control board, Phil spent two years asvice president of operations and general manager ofa smart card company. He was also the managingdirector of a consulting and investment banking prac-tice that focused on transportation. In the 1990s, heworked in various management positions for theCommonwealth in the Highway Department, Execu-tive Office of Transportation and Massachusetts BayTransportation Authority (MBTA). In an interview in BusinessWest (available online at www .businesswest.com/ arch3.05a/index.html ), Puccia compared the fiscal crisis in Springfield to the prob- lems he faced at the MBTA. “When I arrived at the MBTA…[t]here was a $40 millionbudget deficit….What you found was …a management culture that didn’t focuson performance and accountability. And no one paid attention to the bottom line.” Puccia went on to say that turning around Springfield’s fortunes involves more than cutting expenses and raising revenues. “It is also seeking something that has beenmissing from the equation of Springfield’s municipal operations — accountability.”However, over the past year, Puccia said that the control board has taken a numberof steps to reduce health care costs and day-to-day spending. Also, the controlboard is working to promote accountability and efficiency by reorganizing thestructure of the city’s government. In his FY06 budget message, Puccia said “we still have far to go.” The FY06 pro- visional budget, without the inclusion of employee raises, projects a deficit of ap-proximately $6.5 million. While Puccia emphasizes that there is still a lot of hard work to do, he said that he enjoys a close working relationship with Mayor Charles Ryan and his senior staff.“That relationship has served us well in meeting the challenges that we have hadto face over the past year.” Revenue Commissioner Alan LeBovidge, who is the chairman of the Springfield Finance Control Board, said that, “Phil is really doing a great job in Springfield.He is like a juggler. We are moving on so many fronts out there, trying to improveservices for the citizens of Springfield and trying to close the budget gap. Phil isjuggling many issues at the same time.” Phil lives with his family in Andover. He holds a bachelor’s degree in political sci- ence from Fordham University and a master’s degree in business administrationfrom the University of Massachusetts. ■Philip PucciaState Revenues Eclipse Expectationsby $436 Million in FY05 Revenue Commissioner Alan LeBov- idge announced that preliminary rev-enue collections for FY05 were $17.086billion, an increase of $1.133 billion or7.1 percent over FY04. Total tax collec-tions for FY05 exceeded the revisedyearly benchmark by $436 million. Itwas the first time the Department ofRevenue had collected $17 billion in afiscal year “All tax types had improved collections in FY05,” LeBovidge said. “Only salesand use tax fell below the yearly esti-mate and that was due to a one-timeaccounting adjustment of $18 million.Income tax collections accounted formuch of the increase versus thebenchmark.” Income tax collections for FY05 totaled $9.690 billion, an increase of $860 mil-lion or 9.7 percent over FY04. With-holding tax collections totaled $7.674billion, an increase of $306 million or4.1 percent. Sales and use tax collec-tions were $3.886 billion, up $137 mil-lion or 3.7 percent.
