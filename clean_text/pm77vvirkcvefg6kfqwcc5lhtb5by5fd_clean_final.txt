OAK STREET SCHOOL 03/06/05 091200010004 School Accountability Status Categories The list below defines the school status categories under New York State’s school accountability system, which is divided into a Federal Title I component and a State component. A school that does not receive Title I funding in a school year does not hav e a federal status in that year. Schools receiving Title I funds that are not in good standing must provide school choice for their students; those in need of improvement year 2 and beyond must also provi de Supplemental Education Services to eligible students. Other consequences for schools not in good standing can be found at: www.emsc.nysed.gov/deputy/nclb/accountability/siinfo.htm . To be removed from any improvement status, a school must make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in the grade and subject for which it was identified for two consecutive years, or in the case of a School Under Registration Review, achieve the performance targets established for the school by the Commissioner. School in Good Standing: A school is considered to be in good standing if it has not been identified as a School in Need of Improvement, Requiring Corrective Action, Planning for Restructuring, or Requiring Academic Progress, or as a School Under Registration Review. School Requiring Academic Progress: Under the State component of New York’s accountability system, a school that does not make AYP in the same grade and subject for two consecutive years is considered a School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 1) for the following year. In each succeeding year that the school fails to make AYP, the year designation is incremented by one. School in Need of Improvement (Year 1): A school that has not made AYP for two consecutive years in the same grade and subject while receiving Title I funds is considered a School in Need of Improvement (Year 1) for the following year. School in Need of Improvement (Year 2): A School in Need of Improvement (Year 1) that does not make AYP in the grade and subject for which it was identified while receiving Title I funds is considered a School in Need of Improvement (Year 2) for the following year. School Requiring Corrective Action: A School in Need of Improvement (Year 2) that does not make AYP in the grade and subject for which it was identified while receiving Title I funds is considered a School Requiring Corrective Action for the following year. School Planning for Restructuring: A School Requiring Corrective Action that does not make AYP in the grade and subject for which it was identified while receiving Title I funds is considered a School Planning for Restructuring for the following year. School Restructuring: A School Planning for Restructuring that does not make AYP in the grade and subject for which it was identified while receiving Title I funds is considered a School Restructuring for the following year. School Under Registration Review (SURR): Schools that are farthest from the State standard and that have been determined by the Commissioner to be most in need of improvement are Schools Under Registration Review. These schools must achieve performance targets specified by the Commissioner of Education in their area(s) of identification within a prescribed timeframe or risk having their registration revoked by the Board of Regents.

For a school or a district to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in 2003–04, every accountability group must make. For an accountability group to make AYP in 2003–04, it must 1. meet the 95 percent pa rticipation requirement ( 2003–04 Participation ), and either meet its Effective AMO or make safe harbor ( 2003–04 Performance and Standards ). To meet the participation require ment, 95 percent of the grade 4 enrollment in each accountability group with 40 or more students must be tested. To meet the Effective AM O, the Performance Index for each group with 30 or more continuously enrolled students must equal or exceed the Effective AMO. To make safe harbor, the Performance Index of each of these groups must equal or exceed its ELA safe harbor target and the group must meet the elementa ry-level science qualification for safe harbor. (See the elementary-level science page of this report for further information on meeting the science qualification for safe harbor.) ELA Safe Harbor Targets: The elementary-level 2003–04 ELA Safe Harbor Target is calculated by using the following equation: 2002–03 PI + (200 – the 2002–03 PI) × 0.10. The 2004–05 ELA Safe Harbor Target is calculated by using the following equation: 2003–04 PI + (200 – the 2003–04 PI) × 0.10.

OAK STREET SCHOOL 03/06/05 091200010004 Elementary-Level Science Definitions of terms, such as Progress Target and Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), are in the glossary , which is the last page of this report. Made AYP in Science in 2003–04: For a school or a district to make AYP in science, the Performance Index (P I) for the “All Students” group must equal or exceed the State Science Standard or the Science Progress Target. State Designated Level (SDL): The score that students taking the elementary-level science test in 2002–03 must have equaled or exceeded on the written portion of the test to have met the State Science Standard. Qualification for Safe Harbor in Elementary-Level ELA and Math: For an accountability group to be cons idered Qualified for Safe Harbor in Elementary-Level ELA and Math, the PI must equal or exceed the State Science Standard or the Scienc e Progress Target in elementary- level science for that group. Groups with fewer than 30 students tested in elementary-level science are not subj ect to this qualification criterion. Science Progress Targets: The elementary-level 2003–04 Science Progress Target is calculated by mu ltiplying the 2002–03 Percent At or Above SDL by two and then adding one point. The 2004–05 Science Progress Target is calculated by adding one point to the 2003–04 PI. The 2004–05 target is provided for groups whose PI was below the State Science Standard in 2003–04. 2003–04 Performance* 2003–04 Standards 2003–04 2004–05 Accountability Group Count of Continuously Enrolled Students Performance Index State Science Standard Science Progress Target Made AYP in Science in 2003–04Qualified for Safe Harbor in Elementary- Level ELA and Math Science Progress Target All Students 57 188 100 YES YES Students with Disabilities 7 American Indian/Alaskan Native Black 3 Hispanic 1 Asian or Pacific Islander 1 White 52 190 100 YES Limited English Proficient Economically Disadvantaged 15 Final AYP Determination YES *For schools with fewer than 30 continuo usly enrolled students in 2003–04, data for 2002–03 and 2003–04 were combined to determ ine counts and Performance Indices.

OAK STREET SCHOOL 03/06/05 091200010004 Glossary Accountability Cohort: The 2000 school accountability cohort consists of all students who first entered grade 9 in the fall of 2000, and all ungraded students with disabilities who reache d their seventeenth birthday in the 2000–01 school year, who were enrolled on October 2, 2002. Students who transferred to programs leading to a high school diploma or high school equivalency diploma were not included in the 2000 school accountability cohort. The 2000 district accountability coho rt consists of all students in each school accountability cohort plus students who transferred within the district after BEDS day plus students who were placed outside the district by the CSE or district administrators and wh o met the other requirements for cohort membership. Cohort is defined in Section 100.2 (p) (8) of the Commissioner’s Regulations. Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP): Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) indicates satisfactory progress by a dist rict or a school toward the goal of proficiency for all students. Annual Measurable Objective (AMO): The Annual Measurable Objective (AMO) is the PI value that signifies that an accountabilit y group is making satisfactory progress towa rd the goal that 100 per cent of students will be proficient in the State's learning standards for English language arts and mathematics by 2013–14. The AMO will be increased in regular increments beginning in 2004–05 until it reaches 2 00 in 2013–14. (See Effective AMO for further information.) Continuously Enrolled Students: Students enrolled in the school or district on BEDS day (usually the first Wednesday in October) of the school year and until the day of testing. Effective Annual Measurable Objective (Effective AMO): The Effective Annual Measurable Objective (Effective AMO) is the PI value that each accountability group within a school or di strict is expected to achieve to make AYP. The Effective AMO is the lowest PI that an accountability group of a given size can achieve in a subject fo r the group’s PI not to be considered significantly different from the AMO for that subject. If an accountability group's PI equals or exceeds the Effect ive AMO, it is considered to have made AYP. A more complete definition of Effective AMO and a table showing the PI values that each group size must equal or exceed to make AYP are available at www.emsc.nysed.gov/irts. Graduation-Rate Cohort: Graduation-rate cohort for each year includes all students in the accountability cohort in the previous year plus all students excluded from that accountability cohort solely because they transferred to a general education development (GED) program. Certain students with severe disabilities and new immigrants were excluded from the 1999 graduation-rate cohort. Graduation-Rate Standard: The criterion value that represents a minimally satisfactory percentage of cohort me mbers earning a local diploma. The State Graduation-Rate Standard is 55 percent. The Commissioner may raise the Graduation-Rate Standard at his discretion in future years. Performance Index (PI): A Performance Index is a value from 0 to 200 that is assigned to an accountability group, indicating how that group performed on a required State test (or approved alternative) in English language arts, mathematics, or science. Student scores on the tests are converted to four achievement levels, from Level 1 (indicating no proficiency) to Level 4 (indicating advanced proficiency). At the elementary and middle levels, the PI is calculated using the following equation: 100 × [(Count of Continuously Enrolled Tested Students Performing at Levels 2, 3, and 4 + the Count at Levels 3 and 4) ÷ Count of All Continuously Enrolled Tested Students]. At the secondary level, the PI is calculated using the following equation: 100 × [(Count of Cohort Members Performing at Levels 2, 3, and 4 + the Count at Levels 3 and 4) ÷ Count of All Cohort Members]. A list of tests used to measure student performance for accountability is available at www.emsc.nysed.gov/irts. Progress Target: For accountability groups below the State Standard in science or graduation rate, the Progress Target is an alternative method for making AYP or qualifying for safe harb or in English language arts and mathematics based on improvement over t he previous year's performance. Safe Harbor: Safe Harbor provides an alternative means to demonstrate AYP for accountability groups that do not achieve t heir Effective AMOs in English or mathematics. Science Standard: The criterion value that represents a minimally satisfactory performance in science. In 2003–04, the State Science Standard at the elementary and middle levels was a PI of 100. The Commissioner may raise the State Science Standard at his discretion in future years.
