Ledbetter Farms, Inc. 1377 ELOOT AVENUE •LODI, CALIFORNIA 95240 •TELEPHONE (209) 334-6975 October 14, 2005 Comment 8 ToWhom It May Concern: I am writing in support of the new proposed Lodi AVA's. Having been a part of the steering committee, I feel that we did a thorough job in our research and science. These new AVA's will help distinguish each of the outlined areas to our consumers by defining each of the unique AVA's within the Lodi region and establish individual characteristics. As mentioned above, I am in complete suppon of the Lodi AVA petition. Ledbetter Farms, Inc.
