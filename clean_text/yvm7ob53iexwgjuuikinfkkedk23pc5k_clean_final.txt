NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (d) OF§590.209: The fil- ing of a report in accordance with the provi-sions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall not be deemed evidence that the terms of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section have been satisfied. (e) Unless licensed pursuant to this part, any attachment, judgment, de-cree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null and void with respect to any property in which on or since the effective date of §590.207 there existed an interest of a person whose property is blocked pursuant to §590.207(a). § 590.210 Holding of funds in interest- bearing accounts; investment and reinvestment. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or as other-wise directed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any U.S. person hold-ing funds, such as currency, bank de-posits, or liquidated financial obliga-tions, subject to §590.207(a) shall hold or place such funds in a blocked inter-est-bearing account located in the United States. (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the term blocked interest-bearing account means a blocked account: (i) In a federally-insured U.S. bank, thrift institution, or credit union, pro-vided the funds are earning interest at rates that are commercially reason-able; or (ii) With a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Com-mission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provided the funds are in-vested in a money market fund or in U.S. Treasury bills. (2) For purposes of this section, a rate is commercially reasonable if it is the rate currently offered to other de-positors on deposits or instruments of comparable size and maturity. (3) Funds held or placed in a blocked account pursuant to this paragraph (b) may not be invested in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 180 days. If interest is credited to a separate blocked account or sub-account, the name of the account party on each ac-count must be the same. (c) Blocked funds held in instruments the maturity of which exceeds 180 days at the time the funds become subject to §590.207(a) may continue to be held until maturity in the original instru-ment, provided any interest, earnings, or other proceeds derived therefrom are paid into a blocked interest-bearing ac-count in accordance with paragraph (b) or (d) of this section. (d) Blocked funds held in accounts or instruments outside the United States at the time the funds become subject to §590.207(a) may continue to be held in the same type of accounts or instru-ments, provided the funds earn interest at rates that are commercially reason-able. (e) This section does not create an af- firmative obligation for the holder of blocked tangible property, such as chattels or real estate, or of other blocked property, such as debt or eq-uity securities, to sell or liquidate such property at the time the property be-comes subject to §590.207(a). However, the Office of Foreign Assets Control may issue licenses permitting or di-recting such sales in appropriate cases. (f) Funds subject to this section may not be held, invested, or reinvested in a manner that provides immediate finan-cial or economic benefit or access to persons whose property is blocked pur-suant to §590.207(a), nor may their holder cooperate in or facilitate the pledging or other attempted use as col-lateral of blocked funds or other assets. § 590.211 Evasions; attempts; conspir- acies.
