Hon. J OHNA. B OEHNER , The Speaker, U.S. Capitol, House of Representa- tives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : Pursuant to the per- mission granted in Clause 2(h) of rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representa-tives, the Clerk received the following mes-sage from the Secretary of the Senate on June 27, 2012 at 9:12 a.m.: That the Senate concur in the House amendment to the bill S. 3187. With best wishes, I am Sincerely, K AREN L. H AAS. f MORNING-HOUR DEBATE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to the order of the House of Janu-ary 17, 2012, the Chair will now recog-nize Members from lists submitted by the majority and minority leaders for morning-hour debate. The Chair will alternate recognition between the parties, with each party limited to 1 hour and each Member other than the majority and minority leaders and the minority whip limited to 5 minutes each, but in no event shall debate continue beyond 11:50 a.m. f GLOBALLY ENGAGED The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. D REIER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I know that what I’m about to say may be seen as heresy by many—or at least counterintuitive—but, Mr. Speaker, this statement is based in fact: out-sourcing is not decimating our econ-omy. If we take a step back and look at the big picture, setting aside dema-goguery and knee-jerk reactions, we see that engagement with the world-wide marketplace is a positive thing for our economy and our shared quest to create good American jobs. Being globally engaged takes many forms. It includes exporting our goods overseas. It includes imports. It in-cludes complex supply chains that allow us to maximize comparative ad-vantage and productivity on a global scale. It demands innovation, cre-ativity, and adaptability. This is all part of the dynamic worldwide market-place, and it does not constitute a zero sum game. If a U.S. manufacturer can lower costs by importing some of their raw materials, increasing their competi-tiveness and hiring more U.S. workers as a result, our job market improves. American workers benefit. By the same token, if a company can tap into other labor markets, becoming more com-petitive in the process and then hiring more U.S. workers as a result, we can all benefit. This is not a hypothetical scenario. We have the data that demonstrates the clear benefits of engaging in the worldwide marketplace. The last time the issue of outsourcing became a po-litical flash point was in 2004. We often heard this term, ‘‘Benedict Arnold CEOs’’ who were sending good U.S. jobs overseas. The McKinsey Global Institute did an in-depth analysis of the effect of out-sourcing to see what impact it was ac-tually having on our economy. What they found was very interesting. They found that companies that utilize out-sourcing as a component of their busi-ness plans enjoy new export opportuni-ties, increased productivity, and sig-nificant cost savings, all of which sup-port new investment in the United States and greater job creation right here at home. Furthermore, the jobs that are created by globally engaged companies tend to be higher-skill, higher-waged jobs than those created by their nonglobally engaged counter-parts. Mr. Speaker, the findings of the McKinsey report are only buttressed by my own firsthand experience. I’ll never forget, several years ago I was in Kathmandu visiting one of those call centers. Now, many would have viewed that call center as a symbol of outsourced jobs, and yet when I looked around, I found U.S. companies right there. I’m not claiming that all of these products were manufactured right here in the United States, but many were manufactured here in this hemisphere. They had names on them like Carrier air conditioners. There was a Westinghouse refrigerator there, Dell computers, and AT&T telephones. Rather than stealing jobs from Ameri-cans and this hemisphere, this call cen-ter epitomized the very way that glob-al engagement benefits us all. It is simply inaccurate to claim that every job created overseas destroys a job here in the United States, and it completely misses the point. Rather than demonizing those who are trying to build competitive companies that grow our economy and create oppor-tunity for Americans, we should be looking at what we can do to attract VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4160 June 28, 2012 investment here to the United States. We should be looking at what we can do to empower entrepreneurs to revi-talize our economy and restore our job market. Mr. Speaker, attacking private enter- prise won’t create a single job here or elsewhere. In fact, the danger of isola-tionist, mercantilist rhetoric is that it can spawn bad policy that further sti-fles innovation and economic growth. If we want to have a constructive de- bate that leads to policies that will en-courage growth and job creation, we need to look at the facts, and the facts are very simple. Engaging globally through exports, imports, outsourcing, in-sourcing, and all the many ways of tapping into the dynamic, competitive worldwide marketplace is the best way to get Americans back to work. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to succumb to the politically expe-dient but economically damaging rhet-oric of isolationism. f STOP MILITARY RAPE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. S PEIER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to implore this body to finally take mean-ingful action to end the epidemic of rape and sexual assault in the military. For 25 years, Congress has held dra-matic hearings on this issue. It has rocked the military branches. Com-mittee members have beat their chests and demanded answers from decorated generals and military leaders who tes-tified. Congress demanded reports. These reports were provided and are now gathering dust on shelves around Washington, D.C. The time for reports is over. Now it’s time for action to solve this problem. The solution is to take the reporting and investigation of cases of rape and sexual assault out of the military chain of command and place them in a separate office independent of the chain of command with the authority to investigate and prosecute within the military. Last week I called for the House Armed Services Committee to hold a hearing on the widespread sex scandal at Lackland Air Force Base in San An-tonio, Texas. No hearing date has been set. The charges of rape, assault, and sod- omy leveled against six instructors at Lackland are astonishing. One instruc-tor is accused of raping or assaulting 10 victims, and another confessed to hav-ing sexual relationships with another 10 victims of his own. Yesterday we learned that 12 instructors are under investigation for sexual misconduct with trainees and that a criminal in-vestigation is ongoing on four different Air Force bases now. Like many cases of rape and sexual assault, the perpetrators are not deny-ing that they engaged in sexual mis-conduct; they simply contend that the sex was consensual. It comes down to the word of the accuser and the ac- cused, the instructor against the train-ee. In the military, this usually means the perpetrator gets off or receives a disproportionately small punishment, and the victim endures an arduous and humiliating legal process with little sense of justice at the end. Every day more disgusting news is unearthed about Lackland. Everyone wants to know: What is being done about it? This scandal is remarkably similar to the Aberdeen scandal that rocked the Army in the 1990s. Fifteen years ago, a Republican-led Senate held a hearing on a sex scandal at the Aberdeen Prov- ing Ground in Maryland. b1010 The Army brought charges against 12 instructors for sexual assault on fe-male trainees under their command. Nearly 50 women made sexual abuse charges, including 26 rape accusations. One instructor was cleared. The re-maining 11 were either convicted at court martial or punished administra-tively. In an interview about the scandal, then-Assistant Secretary of Defense Kenneth Bacon said: The issue here is the relationship between a trainer and a trainee. The Army regula-tions bar intimate relationships between trainers and trainees, between drill ser-geants and trainees, because they are fraught with misuse of power, with misuse of influence, or the possibilities of misuse of power and influence. This may be hard for some in the ci- vilian world to relate to, but it is the constant reality within our Armed Forces. It is ingrained in our military servicemen and -women to follow the orders of their chain of command and never disobey. Here is an except from a 1996 inter- view with an Army recruit who was raped by her instructor at Aberdeen. The victim, a South Carolina native who joined the Army in December of 1995 as a way to pay for college, said her instructor once ordered her to the bathroom. ‘‘A few minutes later he came in behind me, and that’s when he started to tell me to do certain things,’’ she said. ‘‘To disrobe?’’ Asked the reporter. ‘‘Mm-hmm,’’ she said. She said she never screamed, never said ‘‘no,’’ only that she was traumatized. ‘‘When you had sex in the bathroom, was it something you wanted,’’ the re-porter asked. ‘‘No,’’ Bleckley said. Nothing has changed. Last month in Texas, two victims were asked if they resisted when their Air Force training instructor lured them into a dark supply room to have sex. ‘‘No,’’ they said. They froze. What is happening at Lackland Air Force Base is no different than what happened at Aberdeen Proving Ground 15 years ago. After that scandal, we heard assurances about how seriously the crimes were taken and how ‘‘we’re going to get to the bottom of this prob-lem.’’ Yet clearly the military is un-able to police itself on matters of rape and sexual assault. I called for a hearing into the Lackland scandal because we need to know once and for all why instructors have been permitted to abuse power so freely. And we need to know from top brass that the phrase ‘‘zero tolerance for sexual assault in the military’’ is a fact, not a talking point. f RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 12 minutes a.m.), the House stood in re-cess. f b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. f PRAYER Reverend Greg Lafferty, Willowdale Chapel, Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, offered the following prayer: Lord God, we bless You this day for You are good. You make Your Sun rise on the evil and the good; You let Your rain fall on the just and the unjust. You give all people everywhere life and breath and everything. Yet we rec-ognize that in this great Nation, we are among the most blessed. You’ve granted us freedom and abun- dance, safety and security, the rule of law, and neighborly love. Guide us, Lord, that we may steward these good gifts for the benefit of all. And today, Lord, grant this House of Representatives the wisdom, humility, and diligence to govern well, that in some measure good might overcome evil, beauty might outshine ugliness, and love might undo hate. And in this, Lord, may You be honored and may our Nation dwell in deeper peace and safe-ty. Amen. f THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam- ined the Journal of the last day’s pro-ceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour- nal stands approved. f PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentle- woman from New York (Mrs. M ALONEY ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mrs. MALONEY led the Pledge of Al- legiance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4161 June 28, 2012 WELCOMING REVEREND GREG LAFFERTY The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. P ITTS) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor today to have Greg Lafferty, senior pastor of my home church, Willowdale Chapel, open us in prayer today. Greg studied at Wheaton College and Golden Gate Baptist Theological Semi-nary. He was ordained at Saddleback Church in Mission Viejo, California, where he served as a teaching pastor under Rick Warren. Under Greg, the church has grown dramatically. In his time as our pastor, he has made our church much more ac-tive in our community and engaged around the world. One example is the work with Hope International, touch-ing lives in the Congo through micro-enterprise development. The efforts of the church have been multiplied and improved in many ways under Greg’s leadership. He has helped our church show the love of Christ in our commu-nity in new ways and around the world. Greg has been married to his wife, Deane, for 28 years. She joins us in the balcony. They have three children to-gether: Kelsey, Krista, and Ryan. It is a great honor to have Greg and Deane and have Greg open our Cham-ber today with the opening prayer. f ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WOMACK ). The Chair will entertain 15 further requests for 1-minute speeches on each side of the aisle. f JOBS WILL BE DESTROYED (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today’s decision by the Su-preme Court is extremely dis-appointing, undermining limited gov-ernment and expanded freedom. The decision reveals ObamaCare as a huge tax increase on middle class taxpayers, destroying jobs. We should have health care based on doctor-patient relation-ships rather than politician-patient re-lationships. I agree with the National Federation of Independent Business that 1.6 mil-lion jobs are now at risk and small businesses cannot make plans for the future, which destroys more jobs. House Republicans will continue to work to repeal the government health care takeover law. We will remain fo-cused on enacting commonsense legis-lation that will preserve the doctor-pa-tient relationship, provide every Amer-ican the access they need to health care, and promote jobs in the private sector. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. f HONOR THE CATHOLIC SISTERS (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I re- cently added my name to a resolution introduced by Representative R OSA DELAURO to honor the Catholic sisters for their contributions to this country and to my community. I grew up in the shadows of the Mercy Convent of south Buffalo, New York. The sisters came to Buffalo in 1858, started hospitals to heal the sick, schools to teach the ignorant, and to help all of us see the gifts of God’s presence in a changing world. The sisters take a vow of poverty and obedience to serve God and God’s peo-ple, particularly women and children. The Vatican says that the sisters are failing to uphold the Catholic doctrine and appointed three bishops to rein them in. The sisters reject the Vati-can’s assessment of their life work and vow to fight. In scripture, Jesus says: ‘‘Whatever you do to the least of my brothers and sisters, you do for me.’’ The sisters are doing God’s work with courage, convic-tion, and selflessness. May God’s guiding wisdom continue to inspire their good works. f WALTER ZABEL (Mr. ISSA asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, today many will address the House here and later in the day on subjects of great current importance, certainly the upholding of the President’s health care initiative and, certainly, in fact, the contempt vote we’re going to hear in a few min-utes. But this moment belongs to the peo- ple of San Diego. Walter Zabel died this week at 97. Normally, when some-one dies at 97, they have long since re-tired. He, on the other hand, was still the inspiration for Cubic Corporation, a company he founded that did so much for our national defense over his 50- plus years at its helm. We cannot for-get he was in the office less than a week ago. He was still providing stew-ardship, still receiving the technical benefits of his engineers, and still mak-ing sure that America was safe. Today in San Diego is Walter Zabel Day. It is not a day for the other dis-cussions of the House. f POLITICAL SIDESHOW (Ms. CHU asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. CHU. If you want proof that Con- gress is dysfunctional, that it is put-ting partisanship ahead of all else, look no further than today’s vote to hold Attorney General Holder in contempt. In office, Holder has tirelessly pur- sued justice for all communities. He has helped prevent mortgage fraud, fought gang violence, protected intel-lectual property rights, and worked to ensure every American has the right to vote. We should let the Attorney Gen-eral enforce our Nation’s laws, not make his job harder. The contempt vote against Holder is unprecedented, unjustified, and un-founded. Never in the 223-year history of the House have we held an Attorney General in contempt. Yet, today, we will do just that in this ridiculous par-tisan stunt. Congress should be creating jobs, not wasting taxpayer money putting on a political sideshow during an election year. f CONGRATULATING EDNA YODER ON HER 101ST BIRTHDAY (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to take a special moment to rec-ognize the birthday of a very special American. Today marks the 101st birthday of my grandmother, Edna Yoder. Born in 1911, my grandmother was raised on a Kansas farm with her many brothers and sisters. Work was hard, and she did her part to raise livestock, grow wheat, and help feed America. I take great pride in my grandmother and those in her generation. Hard work, determination, a focus on fam-ily, and deep religious conviction were the values that she and others upheld as they worked to build the most pros-perous Nation the world has ever seen. Today on her birthday, my grand- mother is a vibrant and healthy 101- year-old. She has an infectious laugh, a cheery disposition, and is kind to ev-eryone she meets. Her love of quilting, the ‘‘Lawrence Welk Show,’’ and, of course, board games and bingo keep her time occupied and keep her young at heart. Grandma, you are an inspiration, and we are proud today to congratulate you on the celebration of your 101st birth-day. f b1210 KITTINGER FURNITURE (Ms. HOCHUL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. HOCHUL. Mr. Speaker, last Octo- ber, I stood here and spoke out against the new free trade agreements that would have continued to add to the damage done to the manufacturers in VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4162 June 28, 2012 my district that was done by NAFTA a decade ago. I mentioned a woman I had met at the Buffalo Airport who, after 23 years working in a textile factory, was now selling energy drinks because her jobs had been shipped south and then overseas. That’s why I am fighting for policies that support making it in America. And that is why I am so proud that a company—Kittinger Furniture, a com-pany that makes furniture that’s found today in the White House—is being rec-ognized by the 2012 Best: Made in America Award in recognition to their strong commitment to American man-ufacturing. This Congress must work together to level the playing field for domestic businesses like Kittinger Furniture against unfair competition, particu-larly from China. The American Gov-ernment and American consumers must commit to buying American so we can have more success stories like Kittinger’s. f WINDMILL OF WILLFUL WASTE (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Sec- retary Clinton is giving away $2 billion of taxpayer money for green energy de-velopment in third-world countries. This isn’t money for vaccines. This isn’t money for clean water. This isn’t money to help child hunger. This is money for green energy. Don’t we need to make sure that peo- ple have electricity before we worry about what kind of light bulb they are using? People are starving, being ran-sacked by terrorists, taken away as child soldiers, and dying of preventible diseases like diarrhea. So our govern-ment decided the best use of taxpayer money was to put billions in those countries for green energy. Our government wasted millions of taxpayer dollars on phony loans for green energy right here in the United States to companies like Solyndra. Congress didn’t even approve this $2 billion giveaway. With all the problems of debt in the United States and disease in other countries, government is providing subsidies for green energy. Who would have thought? The government is out of control. More taxpayer money thrown into the windmill of willful waste. And that’s just the way it is. f THE SUPREME COURT RULING (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I’m proud of the decision of the United States Su-preme Court today. I was proud to serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee that actually drafted this bill. I read it many times, and I actu-ally had a lot of amendments. The Affordable Care Act has already benefited millions of Americans and will continue to help those who are in the greatest of need—children, young adults, people with preexisting condi-tions, and our seniors. In my own con-gressional district in Texas, this is par-ticularly important because we have one of the highest rates of uninsured individuals in the country. Our Constitution gives the U.S. Su- preme Court the job to be the decider on what is constitutional. The Afford-able Care Act is constitutional. Just like Social Security and Medicare, now it’s the law of this great Nation. f TODAY IS A GREAT DAY (Mr. COHEN asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today is a great day. It’s a great day for children who want to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re 26—or parents who want their children on their health insurance until they’re 26. It’s a great day for seniors that are concerned about the doughnut hole, for women who have been discriminated against in health care, for all people who don’t want to have copays for pre-ventative care. It’s a great day for peo-ple who don’t want lifetime caps on their insurance or to be denied because of preexisting conditions. And it’s a great day for America because the rule of law has been upheld. Justice Roberts rightfully ruled that this was appropriate and constitu-tional. Let us not forget Justices Gins-burg and Sotomayor and Kagan and Breyer, the five Justices who upheld the Supreme Court belief that the American people have that it is a rule of law and that the Court is not polit-ical. It was a great day for American health care and for American law and jurisprudence. f TODAY’S VICTORY (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, today is not a victory for one party or an-other. It is not a victory for an ide-ology. It is a victory for the American people and for the millions who had, for years, gone without access to qual-ity health care. It is a victory for women who will no longer be discrimi-nated against in their insurance pre-miums and for preexisting conditions and for women and children and seniors and families. This is a great day for our country, as we finally join the community of economically advanced nations that see to it that all their citizens have ac-cess to quality care. Let’s get on with the unfinished busi- ness of helping create more jobs and putting a Nation of healthy Americans back to work. f A TRIBUTE TO DR. WENDY WAYNE (Mr. COSTA asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Dr. Wendy Wayne, who passed away on June 17, 2012, at the age of 64 after fighting a courageous 4-year battle with non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Wendy was a loving wife and mother, a committed activist and respected community leader who touched the lives of many. Wendy led a courageous and energetic life filled with love and adventure. She joined the Peace Corps at an early age and served in Kenya. As a seasoned traveler, Wendy swam the Earth’s five oceans. Her work as an educator, a nurse, and a community leader demonstrated her dedication to fostering and preserving and improving the health and safety of children throughout the world. And her compassion and concern for the com-munity also served as a testament to her extraordinary character. Wendy Wayne’s unwavering loyalty to Kern County and her commitment to the well-being of future generations will ensure that her legacy will live on. She stands as a role model for her fam-ily, her friends, and all that knew and worked with her. And we will all miss her. I will miss my dear friend Wendy Wayne. f IN OPPOSITION TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CONTEMPT VOTE (Ms. FUDGE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Chairman, today I rise to speak in opposition to the House resolution to hold Attorney Gen-eral Eric Holder in contempt of Con-gress. With total disregard of the fact that the Attorney General and the Depart-ment of Justice have cooperated with each inquiry from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee during the last 15 months, Chairman I SSA decided to pursue this extreme and unprecedented action. To take action on this resolution is a gross misuse of this Chamber’s time and energy, given that the information requested by Chairman I SSAwill shed no light on the person or persons re-sponsible for the death of Agent Brian Terry, and that is where our time and energy should be focused. Instead of wasting the time of the committee, the Department of Justice, and the American people with political distractions, the House should be ad-dressing the issues important to the welfare of this country and its people, and that is jobs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4163 June 28, 2012 THERE HAS NOT BEEN FULL COMPLIANCE (Mr. CHAFFETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, despite what has been said here, it is the duty and obligation of this body to address a duly issued subpoena that has not been complied with. There has not been full compliance here. There has not been cooperation here. There has not been a willingness to share the information that is found within the Department of Justice. We have a dead Border Patrol agent. We have more than 200 weapons that were used to kill people in Mexico. We have thousands of missing weapons. We have an Attorney General who said that this Fast and Furious program was fundamentally flawed. And yet here we stand today after doing more than just bending over backwards for more than a year, not having been given the documents that we need, as a body, to make a proper decision. This should be bipartisan in our quest to right a wrong. It’s not about Eric Holder, but it is about the Depart-ment of Justice and it is about justice in the United States of America. I am proud of the fact that we are bringing up this contempt. It’s sad that we got to this day. We have no other choice. But we, as a body, as an institution, as a separate branch of government, have a duty and an obligation, and we are fulfilling that here today. f WHAT CHANGES HAVE REALLY OCCURRED? (Ms. RICHARDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Chairman, I come here today because when I was 6 years old, in 1968, I saw the hate-filled work of the civil rights movement, of laws that needed to be changed. And now I’m here with an opportunity to be here in Congress, and I kind of wonder what changes have really occurred. I see today that Chief Justice Rob- erts stood, and he did the right thing because he ruled on behalf of the Amer-ican people. And I will say that this motion that’s going to come forward will not have bipartisan support of this Member because it’s not done in a bi-partisan manner. It’s done in a hateful manner. And why? Because we have an Attorney Gen- eral where this has never been done— we need to stress that again—never been done in this Congress, where ma-terials have been provided, and where this committee has failed to accept a single witness requested by the other side. That’s not bipartisanship. That’s politics at its worst. I urge the American people to look and to urge us to get back to work and do what you sent us here to do, which is to take care of you. f b1220 WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE TRUTH? (Mr. GOWDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, my ques- tion is simply this: What percentage of the truth do you want? When we’re asked to negotiate; when the Attorney General comes and asks us for an ex-traordinary accommodation, whatever that means; when we’re asked to com-promise; my question for our col-leagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, is this: What percentage of the truth will you settle for? If you have ever sat on the other side of the table from parents who have lost a loved one, is 50 percent enough? Is that enough of the documents? Seventy-five percent? A third? The truth, the whole truth, so help me God—that is what we ask witnesses to do, jurors to do, and that’s not too much for us to ask for the Attorney General of the United States of Amer-ica to do. f HEALTH CARE (Mr. LARSEN of Washington asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to declare that the Supreme Court ruling on the Af-fordable Care Act affirms there’s no going back to the health care of 2009 or even to the health care of 1789. Im-provements to health care are taking root right now in this country. That progress must continue. The Supreme Court decision today is a welcome vic-tory for middle class families and bol-sters the necessary changes taking place in health care today. Now we must keep Medicare sustain- able and affordable by closing the pre-scription drug doughnut hole and cracking down on fraud. Now we must make sure middle class families have diverse options for high-quality, afford-able health care. Now we must ensure that we meet the needs of northwest Washington State seniors, veterans, and families. Northwest Washington has already seen improvement. Seniors in the Second District who were in the doughnut hole have saved more than $800 on prescription medications so far this year. More than 173,000 people in northwest Washington State have health insurance that covers preven-tive care without copays or deductibles. It is time to move forward on health care. And today, America took a great step. AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DECISION (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, as a former judge of the North Carolina State Supreme Court, I’ve come to the well today to applaud the United States Supreme Court for its courage and for ruling on the side of constitu-tionality of the Affordable Care Act. This is a win, Mr. Speaker, for 48 mil- lion Americans, Democrats and Repub-licans alike, who will receive stable, secure, and affordable health coverage forever. I believe that much of the public con- fusion surrounding the bill was because Americans outside of the Washington Beltway simply did not understand what the Affordable Care Act means for them. So to put it plainly, Ameri-cans can now enjoy coverage without worry or jeopardy, regardless of pre-existing conditions. Uninsured young people up to age 26 will be able to re-ceive coverage. If you become gravely ill, there are no limits on your bene-fits. If you are a woman, you can’t be charged higher premiums. If you need preventive care, you won’t have a copay or deductible. If you lose your job, you won’t lose your coverage. And if your employer doesn’t provide cov-erage, you will be able to buy it at af-fordable prices. The political theater Republicans or- chestrated around health care is over. Congress debated, the Court decided. This is done. f WE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED (Mrs. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only as a congressional Member but also a widow of a law en-forcement officer who lost his life in the line of duty. I rise to speak on be-half of all those families that have lost a loved one in the line of duty, and es-pecially for Brian Terry and his family. The Terry family deserves to know what happened. The American people deserve to know what happened. And Congress deserves to know what hap-pened. But let us not forget, Officer Terry’s family deserves to know what happened. I stand here on behalf of all of those families who have lost law enforcement officers throughout our great Nation in the line of duty. We must not waiver. We, as a Congress, need to find out what happened so it never happens again. And that’s something that we never should lose sight of. We need to make sure that whatever took place, it doesn’t happen again. We should not be losing our officers this way. f HEALTH CARE VICTORY (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4164 June 28, 2012 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, today is a great day for the American people. The Supreme Court’s decision to up-hold the Affordable Care Act reaffirms our Nation’s commitment to make sure that all Americans have access to qual-ity, affordable health care and health insurance. For the millions of Ameri-cans who have gone without health in-surance; the seniors who have strug-gled due to inadequate coverage; the women, children, and young adults that have been denied coverage for pre-existing conditions, the Court’s ruling is not only a victory but a validation that they deserve to have the most basic of human needs met—and that is access to health care. The ACA addressed so many gaps in the American health care system, from closing the Medicare part D doughnut hole to stopping the practice of deny-ing those with preexisting conditions insurance coverage to claiming wom-anhood as a preexisting health condi-tion to allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ coverage. This law has changed the way our country manages and delivers all phases of our health care system, and I’m proud to have been part of its cre-ation, and prouder still today to learn that the Court’s decision was to uphold its constitutionality. f HEALTH CARE WIN-WIN (Mr. FARR asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. FARR. I rise today because I think everybody in this country is al-ways worried about health care and whether they’re going to be able to have access to it, whether they can af-ford insurance, whether the complica-tions of that insurance will knock them off health care by putting caps on it or saying you have a preexisting con-dition. But those worries are over. America has health safety now. Every-body in this country will be able to have access to health care. The Su-preme Court made the decision that no one without health care cannot be treated. So I think it’s a really happy day. There’s going to be a lot of discussions here about pros and cons on how it’s all worked out, but each individual, I think, will be able to decide: I can go to a doctor and I can get the kind of care that I need, and it’s going to get paid for so doctors and hospitals will make it. That’s the bottom line. I left my office this morning, and one of my interns is 25 years old, and she says, I’ve got health care insurance be-cause of the law you passed. Until I’m 26, I can stay on my parents’ health care insurance, and I otherwise would have none. Because she’s already grad-uated from college. So this is a win-win for everyone. It’s a great day for America. RELATING TO CONSIDERATION OF HOUSE REPORT 112–546 AND AC-COMPANYING RESOLUTION, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF HOUSE RESOLUTION 706, AU-THORIZING COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM TO INITIATE OR INTER-VENE IN JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS TO ENFORCE CERTAIN SUB-POENAS Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, by direc- tion of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 708 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol- lows: H. R ES. 708 Resolved, That if House Report 112-546 is called up by direction of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: (a) all points of order against the report are waived and the report shall be considered as read; and (b)(1) an accompanying resolution offered by direction of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform shall be considered as read and shall not be subject to a point of order; and (2) the previous question shall be consid- ered as ordered on such resolution to adop-tion without intervening motion or demand for division of the question except: (i) 50 minutes of debate equally divided and con-trolled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform or their respective des-ignees; (ii) after conclusion of debate one motion to refer if offered by Representative Dingell of Michigan or his designee which shall be separately debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the pro-ponent and an opponent; and (iii) one motion to recommit with or without instructions. The Chair may reduce the minimum time for electronic voting on the question of adoption of the motion to recommit as though pursu-ant to clause 9 of rule XX. S EC. 2. Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order without intervention of any point of order to consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 706) authorizing the Com-mittee on Oversight and Government Reform to initiate or intervene in judicial pro-ceedings to enforce certain subpoenas. The resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question shall be considered as or-dered on the resolution to adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of the question except: (1) 20 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the Major-ity Leader and the Minority Leader or their respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from Florida is recognized for 1 hour. b1230 Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts, my colleague on the Rules Committee, Mr. M CGOVERN , pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consider-ation of this resolution, all time yield-ed is for the purpose of debate only. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to re-vise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying resolution it brings to the House floor. The rule provides for consideration of two contempt of Congress charges laid against Attorney General Eric Holder. You’re going to hear a lot of folks say how historic today is. That ‘‘historic- ness’’ is why the rule provides for de-bate and separate votes on both con-tempt charges. The rule also provides for a motion to refer the criminal con-tempt charges, if offered by Mr. D IN- GELL , as well as motions to recommit both resolutions. I don’t assume to put words in his mouth, but I’m sure and I’m willing to bet that Mr. M CGOVERN is sitting over there getting ready to tell me it’s not enough time. I’m not going to disagree. But as we all know, before we leave Friday evening to go to work in our districts, we have a lot to get done here. We need to reauthorize our Na-tion’s highway and infrastructure sys-tems. We need to save college students and recent graduates from student loan interest rates that are 2 days away from doubling. We need to move for-ward with the open amendment process and finish considering the appropria-tions bill to fund our transportation and housing programs. It’s a lot to get done in 2 days. And, frankly, if we didn’t put a time limit on today’s con-tempt debate, we could spend days on end talking about nothing but this one issue. But beyond all of that—beyond floor schedules and expiring authorizations, we’re left with this truth: Border Pa-trol Agent Brian Terry was shot on De-cember 14, 2010, and died of those inju-ries the next day. His family has been looking for answers about what led up to and caused his death for over a year and a half. If we can do anything to an-swer those questions, then we cannot and should not do anything to make them wait any longer—not another month, not another day, not another hour. Today, the House of Representa-tives is going to do what we can to get those answers for the Terry family. Thanks to whistleblowers at the Bu- reau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Members of Congress were alerted to the fact that Agent Terry was killed by guns—AK–47 assault ri-fles, specifically—that our government allowed to walk into Mexico. When confronted with these claims, the Jus-tice Department denied the whistle-blowers’ claims. What we now know all too well is just how right the whistle-blowers were. However, it took the De-partment of Justice 10 months after their first denial, almost a year after Border Patrol Agent Terry’s death, to formally retract their denial about the reckless program that contributed to the deaths of Agent Terry and hun-dreds of Mexican citizens.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4165 June 28, 2012 You know, I was a cop for almost 40 years and a sheriff for the last 10. As the head of a law enforcement agency, you have two options when you make a mistake: you can hope it doesn’t come out, and if it does, you go into lockdown and deny, deny, deny; or you can get out in front of it, admit you made a mistake, tell the American peo-ple you’re going to investigate, and then do everything you can to make sure that this never happens again. As sheriff, I found it was my moral imperative to always admit when we’d been wrong, hold folks accountable, and make my agency better so we wouldn’t make the same mistake twice. It’s the responsible thing to do, and it takes away any sting of the pos-sibility of a coverup. That’s not what DOJ did. They’ve gone the other route—hide, deny, and stonewall. They sent a letter with false informa- tion to Congress, the institution that’s constitutionally mandated with gov-ernment oversight, and it took them 10 months to retract that statement. It appears that in those 10 months be-tween lying and admitting the truth, members of DOJ and the ATF colluded to intentionally cover up what hap-pened. What we’re trying to figure out is if there really was a coverup, and we need the information to determine the facts. Yesterday at the Rules Committee, a couple of people mentioned President Nixon and Watergate. And I agree, this is like the Watergate scandal. But President Nixon didn’t leave office be-cause of the scandal itself; he was forced to resign because of the coverup. I said it last night and I’m willing to bet, Attorney General Holder didn’t know all the specifics about what was happening with Fast and Furious, but when the facts started coming to light and congressional investigators started looking for answers, he repeatedly kept us from getting information we need. And that has kept the Terry family from getting the closure they need. Attorney General Holder is respon- sible for his agency, but he has essen-tially given his top leadership a free pass. Mr. Speaker, a law enforcement offi- cer who was employed by the United States Federal Government is dead. Somebody knows what happened to re-sult in his death, and the Justice De-partment and now President Obama are refusing to release that informa-tion to Congress, to the American pub-lic, and to Agent Terry’s family. This institution has a duty to oversee the executive branch and to find out what happened. The answers are there. Attorney General Holder knows the an-swers are there because he’s the one who has the documents that contain the answers we’re looking for. He’s the gatekeeper here, and if he won’t give us the information this institution needs to do our duty, our constitutional duty, then we will use every legal and constitutional tool that we have to get to it. I’ve heard some people say this is all about politics. In my heart, it’s just the opposite. It couldn’t be further from the truth. These contempt charges aren’t about politics. They aren’t about Attorney General Holder, President Obama, or anything else but this: a man died serving his country, and we have a right to know what the Federal Government’s hand was in that. It’s clear this country somehow played a role in his death. We need to root it out, find the cause, and make sure this never, ever happens again. These votes today aren’t about poli-tics; they are about answers that, at the very least, this country owes Agent Terry and his family. President Obama promised his would be the most open administration in his-tory. When discussing executive privi-lege in the past, Attorney General Holder has made it clear that the DOJ won’t invoke the State secrets privi-lege to conceal ‘‘violations of the law’’ or ‘‘administrative error,’’ avoid ‘‘em-barrassment,’’ or to ‘‘prevent or delay the release of information.’’ Unfortunately, that is exactly what has happened so far with Fast and Fu-rious. It is for this reason why the House today sees no other choice other than to charge Attorney General Eric Holder with both civil and criminal contempt of Congress charges. I’m going to support both of these resolutions, Mr. Speaker, not because it’s the political thing to do, not be-cause it’s the easy thing to do, but be-cause it’s the right thing to do. And with that, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. N UGENT ), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. (Mr. M CGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this is a sad and deeply troubling day for this House of Representatives. The Repub-lican leadership of this body is asking us to take the unprecedented and un-justified step of holding a sitting At-torney General in contempt of Con-gress. b1240 They are doing so based on a com- pletely partisan ‘‘investigation.’’ This is a witch hunt, pure and sim- ple, Mr. Speaker, and it has no place in this House. Eric Holder is a good and decent and honorable public servant. He has reinvigorated the Justice De-partment, especially on efforts to stop partisan voter suppression across the country. I find it interesting that the Repub- lican leadership has scheduled this nonsense for the floor today when it is certain to be buried under the ava-lanche of news and reaction to the Su-preme Court’s health care decision and the highway bill and the student loan bill and everything else. Is it possible that the Republican leadership doesn’t really want the American people seeing what the House is doing today? Why else would they feel the need to rush this to the floor a mere week after the House Oversight Committee voted along strictly partisan lines to adopt the Republican contempt citation? Let me say at the outset that there are certain things that all of us, Demo-crats and Republicans alike, agree on. We all agree that the death of Agent Terry was a terrible tragedy. We all agree that the ATF field office’s em-brace of gunwalking—which began under the Bush administration, by the way—was a terrible idea. We all agree that the ATF should not have sent an erroneous letter to Senator G RASSLEY in 2011. But the contempt resolution before us doesn’t have anything to do with any of that. The Department of Justice has pro- vided thousands and thousands of docu-ments about gunwalking. The Attorney General has testified nine times. The Department has provided over 1,000 pages of documents about the letter sent to Senator G RASSLEY . So this isn’t about getting to the truth; this is about politics. It is about politics. This is about the Republicans refusing to take ‘‘yes’’ for an answer. This is about doing whatever it takes to attack the Obama administration no matter the issue, no matter the cost. During the committee’s ‘‘investiga- tion,’’ the Republican majority refused all Democratic requests for witnesses and hearings, as well as requests to interview any Bush administration ap-pointees. All of them were denied. The Republicans refused Democratic requests to hold a hearing with Ken Melson, the head of ATF. You know, if you’re actually interested in learning about an ATF operation, don’t you think you would want to talk to the leadership of the ATF? Republicans refused Democratic re- quests to hold a hearing with former Attorney General Mukasey, who was briefed on botched ATF operations in 2007. If you’re actually interested in learning about these botched oper-ations, wouldn’t you want to talk to the man who was briefed about them? I would hope that we would all agree that we should never take a step like finding a sitting Attorney General in contempt lightly, and that we should only do so based on accurate informa-tion. But Ranking Member C UMMINGS and his staff have found, in a very short time, 100 concerns, omissions, and inaccuracies in the committee re-port that is the foundation of this con-tempt resolution—100 inaccuracies and omissions and concerns. Sadly, instead of getting answers to those questions, this has been rushed to the floor. Mr. Speaker, the American people ex- pect us to address the issues that mat-ter most to them—issues like jobs and the economy and education and health care—but the Republican majority re-fuses to listen. Instead, they bring this VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4166 June 28, 2012 resolution to the floor, and then they wonder why Congress is so unpopular. What troubles me most, perhaps, is that under this Republican majority, everything has to be a fight—every-thing. Everything has to be a con-frontation, everything has to be a showdown. And I get the politics. I un-derstand this is an election year. But this goes way, way too far. It is just wrong. I wish the Speaker of the House would have intervened here and kept this off the floor. By moving forward today on this resolution, we diminish the House of Representatives. This is not a happy day for this institution. I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and the underlying resolutions, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, the gen- tleman from Massachusetts made a statement. This is about a contempt ci-tation because the Attorney General has not provided all the information the committee has asked for. Out of 140,000 pages—by his own testimony in front of Judiciary—he’s given a little over 7,000 pages. That’s not reaching out and doing the right thing. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. S COTT), a fellow Rules Committee member. Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for the time. Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that my friends on the left need some clarifica-tion on why we are here this afternoon. This is not a good day for America, and it is certainly still not a good day for the Terry family. My friends on the left continue to talk about this as if it were a witch hunt—a witch hunt. We have a slain Border Patrol agent, and my friends on the left want to politicize this by talk-ing about a witch hunt when in fact we all know that this, Mr. Speaker, is about justice. This is about justice. My friend on the left just said that we Republicans refuse to hear ‘‘yes,’’ we refuse to accept ‘‘yes’’ as an answer. Well, Mr. Speaker, we want a ‘‘yes’’ for Kent Terry, we want a ‘‘yes’’ for Jose-phine Terry, the parents of Brian Terry. We want a ‘‘yes’’ for the Amer-ican people. We want a ‘‘yes’’ as it re-lates to the integrity of the process, and we want a ‘‘yes’’ for justice. And, Mr. Speaker, my friends on the left continue to consistently say ‘‘no.’’ We are here, Mr. Speaker, for only two reasons. The first is because United States Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry is dead because of a Fed-eral Government operation that al-lowed American guns to be walked across the border in the hands of drug lords and cartels. We are here today, Mr. Speaker, because the Department of Justice; the Attorney General, Eric Holder; and now the President refuse to comply with congressional subpoenas that will give us clarity on these ques-tions, give us clear answers for the Terry family and for the American peo-ple. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NUGENT. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. We have been trying for 18 long months to get to the bottom of this issue, and yet we are being stonewalled. Yes, we hear that the Federal Gov- ernment has provided 7,000-plus pages; but, Mr. Speaker, there are over 100,000 pages that we have requested. We are talking about a period from February 4, 2011, to December 2011, where we were given false information. It is our responsibility, it is our duty to find the truth for the American people and the Terry family. Let me close, Mr. Speaker, by simply saying, how are we supposed to protect and ensure the safety of our Border Pa-trol agents in the future if we do not know who allowed the guns to walk across the border? How are we supposed to give Brian Terry’s family any sense of closure, Mr. Speaker? This is why we have no choice but to be here today. The refusal of the Attorney General to provide answers regarding Brian Ter-ry’s death leaves us no choice but to be here today. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me yield myself such time as I may con-sume before I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the last time Congress dealt with a contempt resolution was in the case of Joshua Bolton and Har-riet Miers. The period of time between when the committee voted out the res-olution and before there was floor ac-tion was 6 months. The reason why there was time taken was to make sure that we got it right. This is less than a week. And I’m going to say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that the minority staff has compiled a list of 100 inaccura-cies—100 inaccuracies in the report that was the basis for this contempt resolution—100—and they’re rushing it to the floor. So don’t tell me this is not about politics. Don’t tell me this is not a witch hunt. It is exactly what it is. Mr. Speaker, I’d like to yield 2 min- utes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. B UTTERFIELD ). Mr. BUTTERFIELD. The gentleman from Massachusetts is absolutely cor-rect, this is a sad and troubling day. What we see here today, Mr. Speaker, is nothing more than using the Halls of Congress for extreme partisan political purposes. b1250 This case is all about a politically motivated confrontation with the exec-utive branch on a matter that does not even begin to rise to this level. This case is not about gunwalking. Those documents have been provided and are not in dispute. The documents at issue are completely unrelated to how gunwalking was initiated in Oper-ation Fast and Furious. The Depart-ment has produced thousands of pages of documents. The committee has interviewed two dozen officials, and the Attorney General has testified on nine occasions. This is an election-year witch hunt. I say that to the gentleman from South Carolina. This is an election-year witch hunt. During this 16-month investiga-tion, the committee refused all Demo-cratic requests for witnesses and hear-ings, as well as requests to interview any Bush administration appointees. Never in our Nation’s history has the House of Representatives voted to hold a sitting Attorney General or a Cabinet member in contempt. What’s different? I will tell you what’s different. It is the simple fact that Republicans have a dogged determination to discredit and defeat this President at all costs. Plain and simple, it’s politics. My Republican friends, do not use your majority to engage in a political stunt. The integrity and legacy of this institution deserve better than that. If you want to discredit and defeat this President, you need to leave this floor and leave the C–SPAN cameras, and go out and give it your best shot. This is not the place to do it. When the history of this despicable proceeding is recorded, it will be said that your actions were politically mo-tivated to discredit and defeat a Presi-dent who has worked so hard over the past 3 years. I encourage my colleagues to join me in refusing to vote for this gimmick and walk to the steps of the Capitol and explain the circumstances of this dark day. Do not vote for this resolu-tion. For those of you who choose to vote, I ask that you defeat the rule and vote against these contempt resolutions. ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem- bers are reminded to direct their re-marks to the Chair. Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may con-sume. You know, it’s amazing that my friends forget about history because they referenced history in 2008 as re-lated to House Resolution 979 and House Resolution 980. And you know what they did? They passed a rule and said it’s here- by adopted. You never even had discus-sion on the House floor like we’re going to do today. Never had debate on the House floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4167 June 28, 2012 Government Reform Committee to conduct a more thorough investigation into Operation Fast and Furious. Congressman Dingell represents the dis- trict in Michigan where Brian Terry was born and where his family still resides, but his views don’t represent those of the Terry family. Nor does he speak for the Terry fam-ily. And he has never spoken to the Terry family. His office sent us a condolence letter when Brian was buried 18 months ago. That’s the last time we heard from him. A year ago, after the House Oversight and Reform Committee began looking into Oper-ation Fast and Furious, one of Brian’s sisters called Rep. Dingell’s office seeking help and answers. No one from his office called back. Mr. Dingell is now calling for more inves- tigation to be conducted before the Attorney General can be held in contempt of Congress. The Terry family has been waiting for over 18 months for answers about Operation Fast and Furious and how it was related to Brian’s death. If Rep. Dingell truly wants to support the Terry family and honor Brian Terry, a son of Michigan, he and other Mem-bers of Congress will call for the Attorney General to immediately provide the docu-ments requested by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. R OSS). Mr. ROSS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to offer my support to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress. In December 2010, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed with a gun that was allowed to walk across the border as a result of Operation Fast and Furious. Mr. Speaker, some, including this At- torney General and some of my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle, state that this operation began in a previous administration. This is de-monstrably false, and nothing could be further from the truth. While there was a program under the previous administration known as Wide Receiver, the differences are quite stark. Under Wide Receiver, weapons were tracked, the Mexican government was involved, and no one died as a re-sult of that operation. In fact, Oper-ation Wide Receiver ended in late 2007, nearly 2 years before Fast and Furious began and nearly 9 months before this President was sworn into office. Fast and Furious allowed guns to walk across the Mexican border with no tracking, no involvement by Mexi-can officials. Over 2,000 firearms dis-appeared across the border under this failed operation. Hundreds of Mexicans are dead because of this failed oper-ation. An American hero and United States Marine, Agent Brian Terry, is dead be-cause of this failed operation. Agent Terry stood his ground and told moms and dads across America that no one would hurt their children on his watch. He stood up and took that responsi-bility. To this day, no one, and I mean no one, in this administration has had the guts to stand up and say, ‘‘It was my fault.’’ Attorney General Holder has re-fused to comply with a congressional subpoena that was issued in October of 2011. I was a practicing attorney in the real world before I came to Congress. In the real world, Americans are ex-pected to comply with subpoenas. Is the Attorney General any different? No, he is not. Are we just supposed to take Mr. Holder’s word that we have all the in-formation? That may be how Washington works, Mr. Attorney General, but that is not how Main Street works. Mr. Attorney General, what are you hiding? What are you hiding from the Brian Terry family? What are you hid-ing from the American public? I’ve said it before and I will say it again: you can delegate authority but you cannot delegate responsibility. Mr. Speaker, the Attorney General can stonewall all he wants. The Attor-ney General can misremember all he wants. But whether he likes it or not, today responsibility will land on his desk. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Chairman I SSAfor his steadfast leadership in the pursuit of the truth. I applaud my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle who are putting the search of the truth before party. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield another 15 seconds to the gentleman from Florida. Mr. ROSS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I applaud all of those, like Agent Terry, who wear the uniform of the Armed Forces or stand on the border and guard our Nation. Agent Terry knew a thing or two about duty. He died while on duty. It is now the duty of this Congress to hold those responsible and accountable for this failed operation. We will not forget, and we will always stand with you. ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Once again, Members are advised to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My friend from Florida (Mr. N UGENT ) talked about obstructionism, and I want to say a couple of words about that because I think this whole process has obstructed justice. During the committee’s 16-month in- vestigation, the committee refused all Democratic requests for witnesses and hearings, which is unprecedented. For instance, the committee refused to hold a public hearing with Ken Melson, the head of ATF, the agency respon-sible for this operation, after he told committee investigators privately that he never informed senior department officials about gunwalking because he was unaware of it. The committee also refused a hear- ing, or even a private meeting, with former Attorney General Mukasey, who was briefed on botched efforts to coordinate interdictions with Mexico in 2007, and was informed directly that these efforts would be expanded during his tenure; refused the opportunity to have the Attorney General as a wit-ness. Mr. Speaker, this partisanship was demonstrated by the committee’s vote along strictly partisan lines to hold the Attorney General in contempt and to vote along strictly partisan lines on every amendment. This is about poli-tics. This is not about the truth. This is not about justice. This is about poli-tics, and that is why this is such a sad day for this institution. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. W ELCH ). Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, the investigation that’s being conducted by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is a legitimate investigation. But the rec-ommendation to this House to hold the Attorney General in contempt is reck-less, irresponsible, unnecessary, and will actually get in the way of the pur-suit of truth. Why do I say that? If you’re going to do an investiga- tion, you have to begin at the begin-ning, and the beginning of Fast and Fu-rious and gunwalking began in the Bush administration. There’s no evi-dence that President Bush was aware of it. There’s some questions about what his Attorney General knew, what and when. But if you are sincerely interested in trying to find out what happened, how it happened, how in the world do you not begin at the beginning? And despite that fact, the requests of many of us on the committee who sup-port an investigation, who support the use of a subpoena, who support the ag-gressive right of Congress to get access to documents that it needs, have been denied the opportunity to bring in wit-nesses about what happened and how it happened during the Bush administra-tion. We’ve been denied the opportunity to bring in Attorney General Mukasey, despite the fact that there was evi-dence that he was personally briefed on the botched efforts to coordinate inter-diction with Mexican authorities. Then-Attorney General Mukasey was also told that the ATF field office in Phoenix planned to expand these oper-ations during his tenure. So our ques-tion really quite simply is, begin at the beginning. That foundation of an open and ex- haustive search is what this com-mittee, the Committee on Government Reform, owes to this House of Rep-resentatives before it asks the Mem-bers of this House to vote on the ex-traordinary measure of finding a sit-ting Attorney General in contempt. Secondly, we’ve got to do our job with care. The original subpoena that went out and was there until the Fri-day before the Wednesday in which we voted was demanding that the Attor-ney General turn over documents that VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4168 June 28, 2012 would have been illegal for him to turn over—transcripts of the grand jury. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. M CGOVERN. I yield the gen- tleman an additional 15 seconds. b1300 Mr. WELCH. So transcripts of the grand jury, transcripts of wiretap ap-plications, which is not only a viola-tion of the U.S. Code, but would jeop-ardize law enforcement officials if that word got out. That is an irresponsible and overbroad subpoena. So the bottom line is to let the inves- tigation continue, but let’s acknowl-edge that the job that the committee needs to do before it asks for a vote of contempt has not been done. Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas, Judge P OE. Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the gen- tleman. Mr. Speaker, we are here today be- cause of an ill-conceived, dangerous, il-legal, gun-running scheme called Oper-ation Fast and Furious. This operation has resulted in the death of at least one—maybe two—Fed-eral agents and in the deaths of hun-dreds of Mexican nationals; yet we still cannot get a straight answer from the Justice Department as to what hap-pened. The Attorney General says he doesn’t know who authorized this non-sense, but he won’t let Congress help him find out the facts. In December of last year, Attorney General Holder testified before the House Judiciary Committee and told me that Operation Fast and Furious was ‘‘flawed and reckless’’ and that it was ‘‘probably true’’ that more people were going to die. Now, isn’t that lovely? Why is the Attorney General being so obstinate? After months of delay, delay, delay, today is the day of reck-oning. This administration claims to be the most transparent administration in history. So why won’t the administra-tion let the American people know what happened during Fast and Furi-ous? What are they hiding? This contempt resolution is about one thing. It’s about finding out how such a stealth and dangerous operation could ever be authorized by the Gov-ernment of the United States. Why would our government help smuggle guns to our neighbor and put them in the hands of the enemy of Mexico and the United States—the violent drug cartels? And no wonder the Attorney General of Mexico wants those in the United States who are responsible to be extra-dited to Mexico and tried for those pos-sible crimes. Mexico is more interested in Fast and Furious than is our own government. As a former judge, I can tell you that contempt is used as a last resort to let individuals know they will comply with a lawful order whether they like it or not. Even the Attorney General cannot evade the law. Time for America to find out the truth about gun smuggling to Mexico. Time for a little transparency. Today is judgment day. And that’s just the way it is. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me remind my friend that this gunwalking program started under President Bush. And that’s just the way it is. I would like to yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G ENE GREEN ). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mem- bers, I’m from Texas. We believe it’s our constitutional right to own every gun that was ever made, and we don’t want to export them to anywhere—but this resolution is pure politics. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to the resolution recommending that the House of Representatives find Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attor-ney General, U.S. Department of Justice, in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with a subpoena duly issued by the committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In 2005, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) initiated Project Gunrunner that focused on stemming the flow of firearms into Mexico. This would stop guns from being obtained by drug cartels and criminal organizations that have killed thousands in Mexico in recent years. Part of Project Gunrunner was Operation Fast and Furious, which has come under scru-tiny over the past year due to reports that the ATF allowed the sale of hundreds of assault weapons to suspected straw purchasers, who then allegedly transported these weapons through the Southwest and into Mexico. In De-cember 2010, suspected firearms linked to Operation Fast and Furious were found at the murder scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. This resolution is not about Project Gun- runner or Operation Fast and Furious because the Department of Justice has produced thou-sands of pages of documents, two dozen offi-cials have been interviewed, and the Attorney General has testified nine times, to show it was not responsible for these operations. The Attorney General has continually offered to provide even more information, including doc-uments outside of the Committee’s original subpoena. The documents that are now at the center of the resolution are completely unre-lated to how Project Gunrunner or Operation Fast and Furious were initiated. This investigation is nothing more than a hyper-partisan, election-year effort. The Com-mittee vote was strictly along partisan lines and every amendment passed or failed on party-line votes. During this investigation, the Committee refused all Democratic requests for witnesses and hearings, as well as requests to interview any Bush Administration appointees. Attorney General Eric Holder has produced sufficient evidence, through thousands of pages of documents and testifying nine times before the committee, to confirm that once he learned about Operation Fast and Furious, he took action to bring it to a close. The denial of Democratic requests to interview officials of the Bush Administration on this matter only further proves this is strictly a partisan political game to hold the first sitting Attorney General in contempt. Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to a former law enforcement officer who lost her husband in the line of duty, the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. A DAMS ). Mrs. ADAMS. I am going to come to you from a different angle, one of a law enforcement officer. I served over 17 years as a law en- forcement officer, and I worked many undercover operations. As a law en-forcement officer, you knew you didn’t give guns to bad guys. The drug car-tels, they’re bad guys. You know if you let a gun walk with a bad guy that you’re going to see that gun whether it’s at a crime scene, or you’re going to be looking down the barrel of it. So when the Attorney General came to our committee, I asked him, Who approved this operation? Why was it approved? And he just wouldn’t answer. He didn’t know. Okay. Well, what rises to the level of the Attorney General? If an inter-national operation that allows guns to walk to another country and that are then used to kill one of our agents and that are used to kill and maim their citizens doesn’t rise to his level of ap-proval, who approved it? This is something that is just normal procedure in any operation in a law en-forcement agency. So now you have an Attorney Gen- eral who won’t tell us or can’t tell us who approved this international oper-ation. You have others saying, Well, this is something that started under another administration. It didn’t. That was a different oper- ation, and they realized they couldn’t keep up with those guns, so they stopped it. When this one started, it was flawed from the beginning. The At-torney General said it was flawed from the beginning. Yet we still have no answers. We don’t have answers. The American peo-ple don’t have answers, and most im-portantly, the Terry family doesn’t have answers. That’s just unaccept-able. I’ve heard from the other side of the aisle and from my colleagues here today that this is political. This isn’t political. To me, it’s personal. We have a law enforcement officer who was doing his job and who was killed by a flawed operation that no one will take ownership of in the Attorney General’s Office; and the Attorney General, him-self, won’t tell us what rises to the level of his knowing what’s going on in his agency if an international oper-ation does not. So I will tell you that it was not po- litical when I started looking into this and when we started looking into it. It is not political today. The way that it became political was when there was asserted, right before the gavel dropped in the committee, an executive privi-lege. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. NUGENT. I yield the gentlelady an additional 15 seconds.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4169 June 28, 2012 Mrs. ADAMS. I ask you today to ap- prove this resolution. Bring some credibility back to our Department of Justice. If this had happened in an-other agency throughout this Nation and if one of our officers had died and if the Department of Justice were in-volved in the investigation, they would be asking for the same documents that we are asking for. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me just say to the gentlelady that if she is interested in why the United States pursued this gunwalking program, she should talk to the Attorney General under the Bush administration, Attor-ney General Mukasey, when this thing started 5 years ago. Unfortunately, notwithstanding the fact that the Democrats have asked that he be called before the committee, the request has been denied. She wants to know why this is political? The re-quest for every single witness that the Democrats asked to be brought before the committee was denied, the request for every single witness. That is unprecedented in this House in any committee, the fact that the Democrats have been locked out of having any of their witnesses come for-ward. This is not about gunwalking. This is not about finding the terrible truth about what happened to Agent Terry. This is about politics, plain and simple; and it diminishes this House. I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Co-lumbia (Ms. N ORTON ). Ms. NORTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Any doubt that today’s contempt res- olution is political was put to rest when the NRA joined in to blowtorch vulnerable Democrats to vote for con-tempt today. The gun lobby is directly responsible for the gap in Federal law that allowed the straw purchases of guns here that were taken to Mexico, ultimately re-sulting in the tragic death of a border agent. Yet because of a political man-date from the gun lobby, our com-mittee spent no time on the root cause of this tragedy. Instead, after the ma-jority failed to get the documents it re-quested that were under court seal and documents related to ongoing inves-tigations, it asked for internal commu-nications that no Republican or Demo-cratic administration has ever given up. Instead of sparing no effort to give law enforcement the tools it must have to protect our border agents, our com-mittee has spared no effort to get to today’s contempt resolution over issues unrelated to the tragic killing. After 16 months, the committee found no evidence that the Attorney General or other top Justice Department offi-cials knew about the ATF gunwalking. And the committee resolutely refused to hear from top ATF officials who said that they, in turn, had given the Jus-tice Department no such information. b1310 It is Attorney General Holder who stopped the gunwalking authorized and started by the Bush administration. The contempt today, Mr. Speaker, is for the truth. Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I just want to make it very clear that the House rules of article XI talk about, specifically, j(1) as it relates to the rights of the minority. But you have to ask for that. A majority of the minor-ity has to ask for it. It has to be fo-cused on the issue at hand. They were talking about issues as it related to, I guess, gun ownership, and that was not germane to that issue. With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Q UAYLE ). Mr. QUAYLE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, today’s vote is long overdue. For months, my colleagues and I have worked to uncover the truth about Operation Fast and Furious, which cost the life of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in my home State of Arizona. Congressional efforts to get to the bottom of this tragedy and bring ac-countability to those responsible were met with derision by Attorney General Holder. At hearings, when we ques-tioned Mr. Holder, he evaded. When we requested documents, he obfuscated. When I questioned Mr. Holder on June 8, he looked me in the eye and stated plainly that there was nothing whatso-ever in the wiretap applications that suggested the existence of a gunwalking program. Yet, all I had to do was review those same applications to see that what the attorney general had said to me, my colleagues, and to the American people, was nothing but a boldfaced lie. Mr. Speaker, I will re-peat that again. It was a boldfaced lie. Today, let Congress’ vote be a signal to Mr. Holder that dishonesty on the part of administration officials will never be tolerated. Today, let this vote be a signal to President Obama that the security of the American people must always come before his own job security and the job security of his Cabinet officials. Let this vote be a reminder to Mr. Holder and to President Obama that despite their executive overreach, there are, in fact, three coequal branches of government. Let this vote demonstrate that Con- gress has not forgotten its right or its responsibility to provide oversight and to bring accountability. I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying resolution. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Florida (Mr. N UGENT ) mentioned the issue of gun ownership as related to the witnesses that the Democrats wanted to have appear be-fore the committee. How inviting the head of the ATF, which is responsible for Operation Fast and Furious, or in-viting the former Attorney General, who was briefed on gunwalking and knew about it, how that has anything to do with gun ownership—what that has to do with, Mr. Speaker, is getting to the truth. The minority has submitted a re- quest for witnesses in writing and even requested for a—which I guess they have the right to do—a day of minority witnesses, which they were told they would not be granted that day in a timely fashion. This is about politics. This, by all measures, is about politics. Again, the fact that we are doing this today, I think, diminishes the House of Rep-resentatives. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. A NDREWS ). (Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, every Member of this Chamber wants to get to the bottom of the issue of the tragic death of Officer Terry. Every Member of the Chamber wants to find out how the ATF and Justice Department were run as related to that tragedy. So the committee that’s looking into this refused to hear the testimony of the person running the ATF. The committee that’s looking into this refused to hear the testimony of the Assistant Attorney General, who was responsible for the ATF and talked about this with Attorney General Hold-er. The committee that is responsible for this received thousands of pages of doc-uments from the Attorney General to try to get to the bottom of the matter. This procedure does violence to the American Constitution. Yes, we have three separate branches. Those branches are designed to respect each other’s prerogatives. Those branches are designed to avoid a constitutional confrontation and engage in one only when necessary. In the 225-year history of this insti- tution, there has never been a vote like this before—never. Is it because the Attorney General didn’t turn over documents? He turned over thousands of pages of documents. Is it because the people that know about this issue haven’t been made available? To the contrary. The com-mittee refused to hear the testimony of the head of the ATF and the Assistant Attorney General. This procedure diminishes the House. It vandalizes the Constitution. It should not go forward. Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. C HAFFETZ ). Mr. CHAFFETZ. The record will re- flect that in a bipartisan way, the Act-ing Director of the ATF, the person that was actually appointed by Presi-dent Obama, was deposed by both Democrats and Republicans about a year ago for 2 days around July 4. It was 2 days that he was deposed. That record is there. It is crystal clear. We were also denied, by the Depart- ment of Justice, to speak with Lanny Breuer and Kenneth Blanco, two of the key central people at the highest levels of the Department of Justice. To sug-gest that we were given an opportunity to talk to them is patently false.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4170 June 28, 2012 The final part I will make is you can’t complain that Attorney General Holder was here nine times between the House and the Senate talking in part about Fast and Furious and then say that you never had a Democratic witness. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we need to deal with facts in this debate because this is an important matter. The gentleman just talked about these hearings, these meetings with the head of the ATF. The reality was that a year ago Republican staff met with the head of the ATF on July 3 without notifying Democratic staff. Democratic staff were invited to come on July 4. There were no public hear-ings, and no Members were there. Again, I’m not sure what the problem is with having the head of the ATF come before the committee so the American people can hear what the truth is and what the facts are. I don’t know why that’s such a big deal. But to suggest that this was a bipartisan ef-fort is just outright false. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. E DWARDS ). Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, the Re- publican majority is pursuing an un-precedented and a partisan constitu-tional confrontation today, and it’s un-necessary. The contempt resolution that’s be- fore the House is both disgraceful and it really is demeaning to this House. It’s being brought forth by the other side simply to drag Attorney General Holder through the mud and to pub-licly accuse him and the administra-tion and, frankly, by extension, the President of the United States, of a coverup, claiming that our Attorney General was obstructing justice. Re-publicans even went so far as to call him a liar on national television. This is unheard of, it is hyperbolic, and it’s disrespectful to the office and dis-respectful to this House. The fact is that Chairman I SSAand Republicans have continuously moved the goalpost and disregarded the good intent and good faith shown by the At-torney General, the Justice Depart-ment, and the President’s administra-tion. As has been said before, the Depart- ment of Justice has provided the Con-gress with over 7,600 pages of docu-ments and made numerous officials available for testimony, but that’s been rebuffed. Just last week, the At-torney General offered to provide even more internal documents and requested a show simply of good faith on the part of the Republican majority that they wanted to resolve the contempt issue, but they refused, choosing this con-stitutional confrontation instead. That’s because the Republicans, to be clear, are not interested in a resolu-tion. They’re not looking to com-promise. They’re only looking to score political points at the expense of the integrity of the House and the good name of the President and the Attor-ney General. So I would ask us to carefully con- sider what we’re doing here today and to raise into question what we’re doing to this House, to the institution, and to the Presidency. I would ask my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle to ask themselves whether the American people want us to focus on their busi-ness, to focus on the business of mov-ing the country forward, or to simply play politics because you can’t win any other way. It’s a really simple proposition that’s in front of us today. And I would say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: it is time for us to simply walk away from the nonsense that is not doing justice to the American people. Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority is pur- suing an unprecedented and partisan constitu-tional confrontation today. The contempt resolution before this House is disgraceful and demeaning to the House. It’s been brought forth by the other side to drag Attorney General Holder through the mud and publicly accuse him and the Administra-tion by extension the President of the U.S. of a ‘‘cover-up’’, claiming that Attorney General Holder was ‘‘obstructing justice.’’ Republicans even went so far as to call him a ‘‘liar’’ on na-tional television—unheard of, blatantly hyper-bolic, and disrespectful to the office. The fact is that Chairman I SSAand the Re- publicans have continuously moved the goal-posts and disregarded the good faith shown by the Attorney General, the Justice Depart-ment, and the President’s Administration. All told, the Department of Justice has pro- vided Congress with over 7,600 pages of doc-uments and has made numerous high profile officials available for public congressional tes-timony. The Attorney General himself has an-swered questions at nine public hearings. Last week, the Attorney General offered to provide even more internal documents, includ-ing documents outside of Chairman I SSA’S subpoena. All the Attorney General requested was a show of good faith on the part of the Republican majority to resolve the contempt issue, but they refused. That’s because the Republicans are not looking to compromise. They are looking simply to score political points at the expense of the integrity of the House. And so, on June 11th, Chairman I SSA an- nounced his intention to hold a contempt vote. On June 20th, just nine short days later, Chairman I SSAcalled the vote after the Presi- dent invoked executive privilege. From George Washington to George W. Bush, Presidents of both political parties have asserted executive privilege to protect the con-fidentiality of certain kinds of executive branch information in response to demands by Con-gress. In fact, dating back to President Reagan, Presidents have asserted executive privilege 24 times. In previous situations, Committee Chairman put off contempt proceedings in order to con-duct serious and careful review of Presidential assertions of executive privilege. Then Over-sight and Government Reform Chairman W AX- MAN put off a contempt vote after President Bush asserted executive privilege in the Valarie Plame investigation. Chairman W AX- MAN did the same when President Bush as- serted the privilege relating to EPA ozone reg-ulations—on the same day as the contempt vote. Mr. D INGELL , as Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee held two hearings be-fore proceeding to a contempt vote, after he received President Reagan’s assertion of ex-ecutive privilege. But on June 20th, after the invocation of ex- ecutive privilege by President Obama, and over the requests of several committee mem-bers to delay action, Chairman I SSA pro- ceeded with the contempt vote. One question that comes to my mind is why the rush? The Committee recently ‘‘com-pleted’’ a 16-month investigation, one in which the committee refused all Democratic requests for hearings and even for a single witness. Then one week and just seven days after the committee reported out the contempt resolu-tion on a party-line vote on June 20th, the House today will vote on this privileged resolu-tion. The last time the House voted on contempt resolution against executive branch officials was during an investigation in the Bush ad-ministration into the firing of U.S. Attorneys. In that situation, the House Judiciary Committee cited two officials for contempt of Congress in July 2007. The full House did not actually con-sider and vote on those contempt resolutions until eight months later in February 2008. The Obama administration has argued that the documents in question in this instance fall within the executive privilege because they have been generated in the course of the de-liberative process concerning the Justice De-partment’s response to Congressional over-sight, not because the President knew more about this matter than he admitted to or that there was a conspiracy in the White House, as Chairman I SSAfalsely asserts. For some reason, the Republican majority feels that this is a pressing issue. But I can think of a large list of other issues that I feel that Americans would rather we address. It is hard to imagine that the House Repub- lican majority’s actions are anything else be-sides election-year politics designed to make this administration look bad. This resolution will not create jobs, nor will it strengthen our economic recovery. It is far past time to get-ting around to solving the real problems that the American people sent each of us here to resolve. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to carefully consider what we are about to do today. Never in our nation’s history has the House voted to hold a sitting Attorney General in contempt. I urge my colleagues to vote down this partisan and political contempt resolution. b1320 Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire how much time re-mains. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4171 June 28, 2012 Fast and Furious has, unfortunately, degenerated into yet another partisan political attack in an election year. And it’s a shame this is taking place for many reasons. First and foremost, because the American people have a le-gitimate interest in getting to the bot-tom of the gun violence that spills across our border, with the tens of thousands of weapons made in America that end up in the hands of the cartels. But instead of looking into that inves-tigation, instead of finding out what we can do about this gun violence, this has now become a fight over docu-ments, a fight that is completely un-necessary and unjustified. The very documents that are at issue in this resolution were created after this operation had long since been shut down. They will shed no light on the operation. They will shed no light on what we can do to stop this gun traf-ficking. But then that’s not the goal. The goal here is simply the fight. The Justice Department has bent over backwards, produced thousands of documents. The Attorney General has testified eight or nine times before the House, has made every effort to cooper-ate in this investigation, but the com-mittee will not take ‘‘yes’’ for an an-swer because that’s not the goal. The fight is the goal. And so we are here when we should be doing the Nation’s business, when we should be working on legislation to create jobs. Instead, we are here in what is nothing less than a partisan brawl over nothing. And you know how this will end? It will end months or years from now with a settlement in Federal District Court in which the Justice Department will provide the very same documents they have al-ready offered to provide. But we will have wasted our time; we will have wasted our money; and we will have wasted the precious opportunity to get the people’s business done here in the House. In case the majority hasn’t noticed, we are in the midst of a very difficult economy, where people are struggling to find work. They are not struggling to find another partisan fight on the House floor. This is something that cried out for resolution, but those cries were ignored. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. C HAFFETZ ). Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, the reason I am so passionate about this issue is that it’s about openness, it’s about transparency, it’s about the idea that there is no one person in our gov-ernment that’s above the law; that when you have a duly issued subpoena, you comply with that subpoena. In fact, I would like to hearken back to the remarks by President Obama as he took office. He said: Let me say as simply as I can. Trans- parency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency. I will also hold myself, as President, to a new standard of openness. But the mere fact that you have legal power to keep something secret does not mean you should always use it. He went on to say: I expect members of my administration not simply to live up to the letter but also the spirit of this law. He went on to send something to all of the department heads. He said: Government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors or failures might be revealed, or be-cause of speculative or abstract fears. The President further said, relating to Fast and Furious: There may be a situation here in which a serious mistake was made, and if that’s the case, we will find out, and we will hold some-body accountable. We have a dead Border Patrol agent. We have over 200 dead Mexican people. We have a program that the Attorney General called ‘‘fundamentally flawed.’’ We have thousands of weapons that are missing. We have a duty, an obligation to pursue this to the fullest extent and to make sure that we have all those documents so we can make sure that it never, ever happens again. Now there are 140,000 documents, ac- cording to the Attorney General, that deal with Fast and Furious. We’ve been given less than 8,000 of those. Less than 8,000 of those. We deserve to have that. Also, I will be submitting for the R ECORD this statement from the Na- tional Border Patrol Council. This is the AFL–CIO-oriented organization of 17,000 Border Patrol members who call for the resignation of Attorney General Holder. In fact, they say that it’s ‘‘a slap in the face to all Border Patrol agents who serve this country’’ and ‘‘an utter failure of leadership at the highest levels of government.’’ ‘‘If Eric Holder were a Border Patrol agent and not the Attorney General, he would have long ago been found unsuit-able for government employment and terminated.’’ These are from the people on the front lines. We have an obligation to get to the bottom of this. [From the National Border Patrol Council, June 20, 2012] NBPC C ALLS FOR THE RESIGNATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ERICHOLDER JUNE18, 2012.—The union representing U.S. Border Patrol agents called for the resigna-tion of Attorney General Eric Holder for his role in the ‘‘Operation Fast and Furious’’ gun smuggling scandal that directly resulted in the murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry on December 15, 2010. National Border Patrol Council President George E. McCubbin III called the actions of the Attorney General Holder, ‘‘A slap in the face to all Border Patrol agents who serve this country’’ and ‘‘an utter failure of leader-ship at the highest levels of government.’’ Border Patrol agents are indoctrinated from day one of their training that integrity is their most important trait as a Border Pa-trol agent and that without it they have lit-tle use to the agency. Border Patrol agents are quickly disciplined whenever they lie or show a lack of candor. The standard that ap-plies to these agents should at a minimum be applied to those who lead them. ‘‘If Eric Holder were a Border Patrol agent and not the Attorney General, he would have long ago been found unsuitable for government employment and terminated.’’ ‘‘The heroism that Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry demonstrated on that cold night in the dessert of Arizona was in keeping with the finest traditions of the United States Border Patrol and will never be forgotten by those who patrol this nation’s borders. We cannot allow our agents to be sacrificed for no gain and not hold accountable those who approved the ill conceived ‘Operation Fast and Furious’’’, said McCubbin. ‘‘The political shenanigans surrounding this scandal and the passing of blame must stop.’’ A Border Patrol agent cannot acciden-tally step foot into Mexico without a myriad of U.S. and Mexican government agencies being made aware, so there is no possible way that this operation was conducted with-out the knowledge and tacit approval of the Department of Justice and the Obama ad-ministration. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds. Mr. Speaker, if this is about open- ness, then why does the committee have secret meetings where they lock Democrats out? If this is about open-ness, then why won’t they let any Democratic witnesses appear before the committee? And since there seems to be some confusion as to whether or not Demo-crats actually formally requested wit-nesses, I will insert into the R ECORD a letter to the Honorable D ARRELL ISSA on October 28, on November 4, and on February 2, requesting witnesses, in-cluding the former Attorney General Mukasey and Mr. Melson, the head of the ATF. COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOV- ERNMENT REFORM , HOUSE OF REP- RESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, October 28, 2011. Hon. D ARRELL E. ISSA, Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Govern- ment Reform, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D EARMR. CHAIRMAN : As I have stated re- peatedly, I believe Operation Fast and Furi-ous was a terrible mistake with tragic con-sequences. As I have also stated, I support a fair and responsible investigation that fol-lows the facts where they lead, rather than drawing conclusions before evidence is gath-ered or ignoring information that does not fit into a preconceived narrative. On several occasions over the past month, you have called on Attorney General Eric Holder to appear before the House Judiciary Committee to answer questions about when he first became aware of the controversial tactics used in Operation Fast and Furious. The Attorney General has now agreed to tes-tify before the House Judiciary Committee on December 8, 2011, when you will have an-other opportunity to question him directly. With respect to our own Committee’s in- vestigation, I do not believe it will be viewed as legitimate or credible—and I do not be-lieve the public record will be complete— without public testimony from Kenneth Melson, who served as the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). A hearing with Mr. Melson would help the Committee and the American people better understand what mistakes were made in Op-eration Fast and Furious, how these tactics originated, who did and did not authorize them. and what steps are being taken to en-sure that they are not used again. Our staffs have already conducted tran- scribed interviews with Mr. Melson and the VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4172 June 28, 2012 former Deputy Director of ATF, William Hoover. During those interviews, these offi-cials expressed serious concerns about the controversial tactics employed by the Phoe-nix Field Division of ATF as part of this op-eration. They also raised concerns about the manner in which the Department of Justice responded to congressional inquiries. Both officials also stated that they had not been aware of the controversial tactics being used in Operation Fast and Furious, had not authorized those tactics, and had not in-formed anyone at the Department of Justice headquarters about them. They stated that Operation Fast and Furious originated with-in the Phoenix Field Division, and that ATF headquarters failed to properly supervise it. Since the Attorney General has now agreed to appear before Congress in December, I be-lieve Members also deserve an opportunity to question Mr. Melson directly, especially since he headed the agency responsible for Operation Fast and Furious. My staff has been in touch with Mr. Melson’s attorney, who reports that Mr. Melson would be pleased to cooperate with the Committee. Thank you for your consideration of this request. Sincerely, E LIJAH E. C UMMINGS , Ranking Member. COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOV- ERNMENT REFORM , HOUSE OF REP- RESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, November 4, 2011. Hon. D ARRELL E. ISSA, Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Govern- ment Reform, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : I am writing to re- quest that the Committee hold a hearing with former Attorney General Michael Mukasey in order to assist our efforts in un-derstanding the inception and development of so-called ‘‘gun-walking’’ operations over the past five years. THE MUKASEY MEMO Documents obtained by the Committee in- dicate that Attorney General Mukasey was briefed on November 16, 2007, on a botched gun-walking operation by the Bureau of Al-cohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). A briefing paper prepared for Attor-ney General Mukasey prior to a meeting with Mexican Attorney General Medina Mora describes ‘‘the first-ever attempt to have a controlled delivery of weapons being smuggled into Mexico by a major arms traf-ficker.’’ The briefing paper warns, however, that ‘‘the first attempts at this controlled delivery have not been successful.’’ Despite these failures, the briefing paper proposes expanding such operations in the future. It states: ATF would like to expand the possibility of such joint investigations and controlled deliveries—since only then will it be possible to investigate an entire smuggling network, rather than arresting simply a single smug-gler. Attorney General Mukasey’s briefing paper was prepared only weeks after ATF officials had expressed serious concerns with the fail-ure of these tactics and claimed they were shutting them down. After ATF officials dis-covered that firearms were not being inter-dicted, William Hoover, then ATF’s assistant director of field operations, wrote an e-mail on October 5, 2007, to Carson Carroll, ATF’s assistant director for enforcement programs, stating: I do not want any firearms to go South until further notice. I expect a full briefing paper on my desk Tuesday morning from SAC Newell [Special Agent in Charge Wil-liam Newell] with every question answered. The next day, Special Agent in Charge Newell responded in an e-mail, stating: I’m so frustrated with this whole mess I’m shutting the case down and any further at-tempts to do something similar. We’re done trying to pursue new and innovative initia-tives—it’s not worth the hassle. It is unclear from the documents what changed between October 6, 2007, when Spe-cial Agent in Charge Newell indicated that he was shutting down these operations, and November 16, 2007, when Attorney General Mukasey was presented with a proposal to expand them. The documents do not indicate whether Attorney General Mukasey read this briefing paper or how he responded to the proposal to expand these operations. ADDITIONAL GUN -WALKING OPERATIONS DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION Other documents obtained by the Com- mittee indicate that the officials who pre-pared the November 16, 2007, briefing paper for Attorney General Mukasey were aware that it did not disclose the full scope of pre-vious gun-walking operations. After review-ing the briefing paper, Mr. Carroll wrote an e-mail to Mr. Hoover, stating: ‘‘I am going to ask DOJ to change ‘first ever’.’’ He added: ‘‘there have [been] cases in the past where we have walked guns.’’ Mr. Carroll’s statement appears to be a ref- erence to an earlier operation in 2006 known as Operation Wide Receiver. The documents obtained by the Committee do not indicate whether Attorney General Mukasey was in fact informed about this operation, which oc-curred a year earlier. The documents obtained by the Committee appear to directly contradict your claim on national television that gun-walking oper-ations under the previous Administration were well coordinated. During an appearance on Face the Nation on October 16, 2011, you asserted: We know that under the Bush Administra- tion there were similar operations, but they were coordinated with Mexico. They made every effort to keep their eyes on the weap-ons the whole time. Your assertion was particularly troubling since the Committee obtained these e-mail exchanges in July, several months before your appearance on Face the Nation. CONCLUSION Over the past year, you have been ex- tremely critical of Attorney General Eric Holder, arguing that he should have known about the controversial tactics employed in these operations. He has now agreed to your request to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on December 8, 2011, to answer additional questions about these operations. Given the significant questions raised by the disclosures in these documents, our Com-mittee’s investigation will not be viewed as credible, even-handed, or complete unless we hear directly from Attorney General Mukasey. During a press appearance on Wednesday, you stated: ‘‘Our job for the American people is to make sure—since they say they shouldn’t walk guns and they did walk guns—is that we know they’ll never walk guns again.’’ I completely agree with this statement, and I believe my request will help us fulfill our shared goal. Thank you for your consideration of this request. Sincerely, E LIJAH E. C UMMINGS , Ranking Member. COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOV- ERNMENT REFORM , HOUSE OF REP- RESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, February 2, 2012. Hon. D ARRELL E. ISSA, Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Govern- ment Reform, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Given your state- ments at today’s hearing, I am writing to formally reiterate my previous request for the Committee to hold a public hearing with former Attorney General Michael Mukasey. On November 4, 2011, I wrote to you re- questing a public hearing with Mr. Mukasey in order to assist the Committee’s efforts in understanding the inception and develop-ment of so-called ‘‘gunwalking’’ operations over the past five years in Arizona. As I described in the letter, the Committee has now obtained a briefing paper prepared for Mr. Mukasey prior to a meeting with Mexican Attorney General Medina Mora. The briefing paper describes efforts in 2007 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to coordinate interdiction efforts with Mexico after firearms crossed the border. The briefing paper warns, how-ever, that ‘‘the first attempts at this con-trolled delivery have not been successful.’’ Despite these failures, the briefing paper proposes expanding such operations in the future. It states: ATF would like to expand the possibility of such joint investigations and controlled deliveries—since only then will it be possible to investigate an entire smuggling network, rather than arresting simply a single smug-gler. Since I sent the letter to you in November, the Committee has not held a public hearing with Mr. Mukasey. In addition to these documents, I issued a report this week documenting that Oper-ation Fast and Furious was actually the fourth in a series of reckless operations run by the Phoenix Field Division of ATF and the Arizona U.S. Attorney’s Office dating back to 2006 involving hundreds of weapons across two administrations. At today’s hearing, several Members of the Committee acknowledged that the docu-ments obtained by the Committee do not in-dicate that Mr. Mukasey approved gunwalking, just as they do not indicate that Attorney General Holder approved gunwalking. Nevertheless, these Members expressed their belief that Mr. Mukasey’s public testimony is necessary if the Com-mittee intends to conduct a thorough and evenhanded investigation of this five-year history of gunwalking in Arizona. During an exchange with Committee Mem- ber Gerry Connolly at today’s hearing, you stated that you were open to all requests for hearings relating to this investigation. At-torney General Holder has now testified pub-licly six times about these issues. It is only appropriate for the Committee and the pub-lic to hear testimony from Mr. Mukasey at least once. Thank you for your consideration of this request. Sincerely, E LIJAH E. C UMMINGS , Ranking Member. Mr. M CGOVERN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. J OHN- SON). Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak- er, today we need to understand that there are two classes of documents. The ones that relate to pending crimi-nal investigations, those are not dis-coverable or cannot be distributed out-side of the Justice Department under VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4173 June 28, 2012 penalty of U.S. law. You can get 5 years for doing that. You can’t expect the Attorney General to turn those over. The other class of documents is internal communications. There may be some whiff of discoverable informa-tion in those, but they’re covered by executive privilege. And you really don’t know why the Attorney General has invoked executive privilege on those issues, but we have to trust the fact that there’s good reason for that to be the case. Now when you compare what has gone on today and over the last 7 days with what happened the day that Presi-dent Obama was sworn in, you can un-derstand why they’re doing what they’re doing today. You see, not very long after President Obama was sworn in, we got word that M ITCH MCCONNELL said that his mission was to make President Obama a one-term President. And then we know that later on that afternoon, later that evening, when ev-eryone else was enjoying themselves at the Presidential balls, there was a group of Congresspeople—leadership in the Republican Party—that were scheming on how they were going to disrupt and say ‘‘no’’ and obstruct ev-erything that this President put forth. So they have done that. They have done everything they can to make this President look bad. This is a manufactured crisis. It has no legal substance whatsoever. This is just simply a cheap political stunt to bring disfavor upon the President of the United States. And I ask my col-leagues to not let us sink to this level. It is the first time in history that any Cabinet member has been found in con-tempt of Congress. This is truly sad-dening. Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the gentleman from Okla-homa (Mr. L ANKFORD ). Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. Speaker, I would have to concur. This is an in-credibly sad day. This administration that started talking about trans-parency has now sunk to the level of actually concealing documents. Never has an Attorney General been held in contempt of Congress because every other Attorney General has turned over documents to Congress when they were requested. This Attor-ney General has not. I would just compare this whole con- troversy with the Secret Service scan-dal from several months ago. They put everything out, released all the docu-ments, walked through it. It was done. The GSA scandal, released all the docu-ments, held people accountable. It was done. ATF even, when we started this investigation a year and a half ago, put all their documents out, put all their people out, done. As soon as we get to the Department of Justice, it’s slow. It’s delay, it’s delay, it’s delay. The question is, Why? Why this matters when we get to the Department of Justice documents? Be-cause in the Phoenix office, everything was organized in the Phoenix office, then was approved by the U.S. attorney in the Phoenix area, and then went to the Department of Justice—not to the head of ATF—but to the Department of Justice, to DOJ and their leadership, to be approved. b1330 It is essential that we know what was done there and who did it in the proc-ess. So this is not some ancillary thing that’s added to it. This is an important part of this process. Now, there’s all this obfuscation to say it’s Bush’s fault, this is political, there’s not enough witnesses. The es-sence of this particular contempt deals with the documents that, on February 4 of last year, the Department of Jus-tice sent us a letter that said they had no idea about this. And then by Decem-ber, after all yearlong saying, No, we didn’t know, we didn’t know, we didn’t know, come back in December and say, Oops, we did. It is what Eric Holder has called his evolving truth. We want to know the facts of how it started here and went here. There’s 130,000 documents that they say they have. They have turned over a little over 7,000 of those documents. This is not the prerogative for them to con-tinue to hold and conceal those docu-ments. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NUGENT. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds. Mr. LANKFORD. Fast and Furious has moved to slow and tedious. We have got to have those documents to be able to finish up this investigation. It should have long since been done. Eric Holder told our chairman that he has these documents, but he’s using the documents as a bargaining chip to get a better deal. This is not the pre-rogative when we have a subpoena. We are not looking for some conflict with the administration. We’re looking to get to the facts. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. F ATTAH ). Mr. FATTAH. I thank the gentleman. I served for many years on the Over- sight and Government Reform Com-mittee. I’ve been involved in a lot of these investigations over time. I served for many years on the House Ethics Committee. The Congress should be embarrassed about the conduct of this investigation and the charade that brings us to the floor today. The Attorney General can’t provide these documents. The President has protected them under ex-ecutive order, executive privilege, which means that the person who works for the President can’t provide them to the Congress. We all know that. So to take a decent man who’s served his country in almost every ca-pacity—as a military veteran, as a U.S. attorney here in D.C., as a judge—and to drag his name wrongfully before this House, this majority, which clearly has lost its way—in their pursuit of power, they have lost all sense of principle— this is a disgraceful act. But we will get through it. We are a big country, and the American people will recognize the disservice that the Republican majority brings to this floor today. I wouldn’t be surprised, at the end of the day, whether we couldn’t even find this Congress held in more contempt than it is now. I think we’re at a 9 per-cent approval rate. That’s because of the actions of this majority. And the public will have to take account of that as we go forward. Mr. NUGENT. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from Cali-fornia (Ms. S PEIER ). Ms. SPEIER. I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts. This should be labeled ‘‘Fast and Foolish’’ or maybe ‘‘Fast and Fake.’’ We are not talking about gunwalking here. We are doing nothing to help the family of Brian Terry recover. What we’re talking about are interoffice emails between the administration ex-ecutives in the AG’s office. I want ev-eryone here to be willing to turn over all of their interoffice emails. But, more importantly, let’s talk about whether there’s precedence for the assertion of executive privilege. And let me just point to a number of cases when executive privilege was as-serted for noninvolved Presidential communications. In October 1981, President Reagan as- serted executive privilege over internal deliberations within the Department of the Interior concerning, interestingly enough, the Mineral Lands Leasing Act. In October 1982, President Reagan as- serted executive privilege over internal EPA files concerning Superfund provi-sions. In July 1986, President Reagan as- serted executive privilege over docu-ments written by William Rehnquist when he was the head of the OLC at DOJ. In August 1991, President George H.W. Bush asserted executive privilege over an internal Defense Department memorandum regarding an aircraft de-velopment contract. In December 2011, President George W. Bush asserted executive privilege over internal Justice Department ma-terials relating to prosecutorial deci-sionmaking. It has been done many, many times before by Republican Presidents. What we are doing here is a travesty to this institution and to this country. Mr. NUGENT. I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, can I inquire of the gentleman from Florida how many more speakers he has, be-cause we have no more speakers on this side but myself. Mr. NUGENT. We have no more speakers. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4174 June 28, 2012 Mr. Speaker, there isn’t a single per- son in this House who doesn’t honor the service of Agent Terry. There isn’t a single person in this House who does not want justice for Agent Terry’s fam-ily—and the truth. There isn’t a single person in this House, I believe, who doesn’t want to get to the bottom of how gunwalking started and how these operations were so terribly botched. But every single attempt for an even- handed investigation has been thwart-ed by the Republican majority. There has not been an evenhanded investiga-tion. Every single witness that the Democrats requested to be called be-fore the committee was refused. Every single witness. It’s unprecedented. Let me say that Eric Holder is a good and decent and honorable man. He’s doing an excellent job as Attorney General. He does not deserve this. And this institution does not deserve this. I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: Do you really want to go down this road? This is a race to the bottom. This is a witch hunt. This is politics, pure and simple. It diminishes this House of Representatives. We are better than this. Does everything have to be a con- frontation? Does everything have to be in your face? Now, you want to maintain your ma- jority. I get it. You want to win elec-tions. That’s understandable. But at what cost? Do we really need to drag the House of Representatives down this road? This is a stain on this House of Rep- resentatives. We should not be here today. We should be talking about jobs and putting people back to work and about making sure student loans don’t double. But instead, we are doing this. This is so political and so blatantly partisan that I think the American people are sickened by this. And as a number of people have said, You want to know why the approval rating is so low? Watch the videotape of this de-bate here today. We should be doing the peoples’ business. This is not the peoples’ business. This is not about getting to the truth in the case of Agent Terry. This is a political maneuver to go after this ad-ministration. And this has, unfortu-nately, become a trend and a pattern in this Congress. We need to find a way to solve our problems without always having these big confrontations. So I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, don’t go down this road. We urged the Speaker of the House yesterday to pull this from the floor. This is wrong. Please defeat this rule. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is about Agent Terry, who gave his life for this country. This is about what this government has done not to expose the truth but to block the truth. This is about calling on the At-torney General to follow the Constitu-tion. It’s about us following article I of the Constitution in regards to our abil- ity to have oversight. I hear this stuff about witch hunt and about politics and it gets me sick, be-cause I will tell you this: as a former law enforcement officer, we should be more worried about what lousy policies that Attorney General Holder has cov-ered up that caused the death of one of our own in protecting this country. That’s what this is all about. This is about holding people accountable. I hear a lot of things down here. But the rule of law, when I was subpoenaed as a sheriff, we complied with the sub-poena. I understand that the Attorney General feels that he’s above the law in regards to the subpoena, and I under-stand the President’s come in to pro-tect him. But we talk about this body and what the American people think. How about we do the right thing, Mr. Speaker, and we move forward and do the right thing in regards to all the Attorney General has to do is comply with the subpoena. By saying that he’s bent over back-wards, I would suggest to you that under 8,000 pages of documents out of 140,000 is not bending over backwards. This is about our constitutional re- sponsibility to provide oversight. This is about our constitutional responsi-bility to make sure that the Federal Government stays on track, that these executive branch decisions that are made don’t put more Americans at risk. Nobody seems to care about the 200- plus Mexican nationals that have been killed. Obviously, Mexico cares because they want to indict those that were re-sponsible for coming up with this failed idea. b1340 This is about Congress doing its con- stitutional responsibility, holding hearings to find out what happened. And when the Federal Government or branches of the Federal Government stand in the way and obstruct, that’s not the right thing to do. My friends on the other side of the aisle should be more concerned that the Attorney Gen-eral has said to the Congress: Guess what, you don’t matter. Congress does matter. Congress has a constitutional responsibility, Mr. Speaker, to do just that, to have over-sight over the executive branch, and the subpoena is a tool to allow us to do that. And, unfortunately, this Attor-ney General feels he doesn’t have to comply. I beg to differ. I think the American people—but more than that, the family of Officer Terry—deserve to know what tran-spired and what the end of this is. And I think that we should be protecting those law enforcement officers that are out there today. In the United States of America, they are going to be facing these same guns that were walked dur-ing Fast and Furious. If you read the transcripts, hundreds—hundreds—of guns walked. Some have been recov-ered in the United States. And, unfor-tunately, some have been recovered in Mexico and have led to deaths in Mex-ico. One has to wonder how many of those guns are going to lead to deaths here in America. You know, when I raised my hand, along with everybody else, it was to support and defend the Constitution. When I raised my hand as a sheriff, it was to support and defend the Con-stitution. And when Officer Terry raised his hand, it was to support and defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America. We owe it to all of our law enforce- ment officers—Federal law enforce-ment officers, in particular—on this issue, to make sure that they’re pro-tected. And to all of our local law en-forcement officers who are going to be the first line of defense on the streets of our cities and counties, they have a right to know what this Attorney Gen-eral’s office and the leadership has done, not giving people a free pass be-cause it is expedient to do and because we really don’t want to hear what the absolute facts are. Let’s just push the facts aside. Those on the other side of the aisle really don’t want to talk about the facts. They want to talk about it is a witch hunt or it’s politics. The facts are clear. Officer Terry is dead. Officer Terry died because weap-ons were allowed to walk from the United States under the nose of the ATF and under the nose of the Attor-ney General’s office through an OCDETF case. Those are the facts. I would suggest that we should find out how did that come to pass. And then in regards to what was transpired and sent to Congress and Members of Congress about the fact that it didn’t really occur, and then 10 months later, Oh, by the way, you know that memo we sent, it wasn’t correct; we did, in fact, allow guns to walk. We put law enforcement officers of the United States of America at risk because this Federal Government had a botched idea and a bad idea. Mr. NUGENT. With that, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER RESOLUTION RAISING A QUES-TION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I rise to give notice of my in-tent to raise a question of the privi-leges of the House. The form of the resolution is as fol- lows: Whereas the chair of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has inter-fered with the work of an independent agen-cy and pressured an administrative law judge of the National Labor Relations Board by compelling the production of documents re-lated to an ongoing case, something inde-pendent experts said ‘‘could seriously under-mine the authority of those charged with en-forcing the nation’s labor laws’’ and which the House Ethics Manual discourages by not-ing that ‘‘Federal courts have nullified ad-ministrative decisions on grounds of due process and fairness towards all of the par-ties when congressional interference with ongoing administrative proceedings may have unduly influenced the outcome’’; Whereas the chair of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has po-liticized investigations by rolling back long-standing bipartisan precedents, including by authorizing subpoenas without the concur-rence of the ranking member or a committee vote, by refusing to share documents and other information with the ranking member, and restricting the minority’s right to call witnesses at hearings; Whereas the chair of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has jeop-ardized an ongoing criminal investigation by publicly releasing documents that his own staff has admitted were under court seal; Whereas the chair of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has uni-laterally subpoenaed a witness who was ex-pected to testify at an upcoming Federal trial, despite longstanding precedent and ob-jections from the Department of Justice that such a step could cause complications at a trial and potentially jeopardize a criminal conviction; Whereas the chair of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has en-gaged in a witch hunt, through the use of re-peated incorrect and uncorroborated state-ments in the committee’s ‘‘Fast and Furi-ous’’ investigation; and Whereas the chair of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has cho-sen to call the Attorney General of the United States a liar on national television without corroborating evidence and has ex-hibited unprofessional behavior which could result in jeopardizing an ongoing Committee investigation into Operation Fast and Furi-ous: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representa- tives disapproves of the behavior of the chair for interfering with ongoing criminal inves- tigations; insisting on a personal attack against the attorney general of the united states; and for calling the Attorney General of the United States a liar on national tele-vision without corroborating evidence there-by discredit to the integrity of the House. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under rule IX, a resolution offered from the floor by a Member other than the ma-jority leader or the minority leader as a question of the privileges of the House has immediate precedence only at a time designated by the Chair with-in 2 legislative days after the resolu-tion is properly noticed. Pending that designation, the form of the resolution noticed by the gentle-woman from Texas will appear in the R ECORD at this point. The Chair will not at this point de- termine whether the resolution con-stitutes a question of privilege. That determination will be made at the time designated for consideration of the res-olution. f b1430 RECOMMENDING THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER BE FOUND IN CONTEMPT OF CON-GRESS Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I call up the re-port (H.Rept. 112–546) to accompany resolution recommending that the House of Representatives find Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General, U.S. De-partment of Justice, in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with a subpoena duly issued by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The Clerk read the title of the report. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 708, the report is considered read. The text of the report is as follows: The Committee on Oversight and Govern- ment Reform, having considered this Report, report favorably thereon and recommend that the Report be approved. The form of the resolution that the Com- mittee on Oversight and Government Reform would recommend to the House of Represent-atives for citing Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attor-ney General, U.S. Department of Justice, for contempt of Congress pursuant to this report is as follows: Resolved , That Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attor- ney General of the United States, shall be found to be in contempt of Congress for fail-ure to comply with a congressional sub-poena. Resolved , That pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 192 and 194, the Speaker of the House of Representa-tives shall certify the report of the Com-mittee on Oversight and Government Re-form, detailing the refusal of Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, to produce documents to the Com-mittee on Oversight and Government Reform as directed by subpoena, to the United States Attorney for the District of Colum-bia, to the end that Mr. Holder be proceeded against in the manner and form provided by law. Resolved , That the Speaker of the House shall otherwise take all appropriate action to enforce the subpoena. I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Department of Justice has refused to comply with congressional subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious, an Adminis-tration initiative that allowed around two thousand firearms to fall into the hands of drug cartels and may have led to the death of a U.S. Border Patrol Agent. The con-sequences of the lack of judgment that per-mitted such an operation to occur are tragic. The Department’s refusal to work with Congress to ensure that it has fully complied with the Committee’s efforts to compel the production of documents and information re-lated to this controversy is inexcusable and cannot stand. Those responsible for allowing Fast and Furious to proceed and those who are preventing the truth about the operation from coming out must be held accountable for their actions. Having exhausted all available options in obtaining compliance, the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Com-mittee recommends that Congress find the Attorney General in contempt for his failure to comply with the subpoena issued to him. II. AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE An important corollary to the powers ex- pressly granted to Congress by the Constitu-tion is the implicit responsibility to perform rigorous oversight of the Executive Branch. The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized this Congressional power on numerous occasions. For example, in McGrain v. Daugherty , the Court held that ‘‘the power of inquiry—with process to enforce it—is an essential and ap-propriate auxiliary to the legislative func-tion. . . . A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of infor-mation respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change, and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information—which not infrequently is true—recourse must be had to others who do possess it.’’ 1Further, in Watkins v. United States , Chief Justice War- ren wrote for the majority: ‘‘The power of Congress to conduct investigations is inher-ent in the legislative process. That power is broad.’’ 2 Both the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (P.L. 79–601), which directed House and Senate Committees to ‘‘exercise continuous watchfulness’’ over Executive Branch pro-grams under their jurisdiction, and the Leg-islative Reorganization Act of 1970 (P.L. 91– 510), which authorized committees to ‘‘re-view and study, on a continuing basis, the application, administration and execution’’ of laws, codify the oversight powers of Con-gress. The Committee on Oversight and Govern- ment Reform is a standing committee of the House of Representatives, duly established pursuant to the Rules of the House of Rep-resentatives, which are adopted pursuant to the Rulemaking Clause of the Constitution. 3 House rule X grants to the Committee broad oversight jurisdiction, including authority to ‘‘conduct investigations of any matter without regard to clause 1, 2, 3, or this clause [of House rule X] conferring jurisdiction over the matter to another standing com-mittee.’’ 4The rules direct the Committee to make available ‘‘the findings and rec-ommendations of the committee . . . to any other standing committee having jurisdic-tion over the matter involved.’’ 5 House rule XI specifically authorizes the Committee to ‘‘require, by subpoena or oth-erwise, the attendance and testimony of such VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4178 June 28, 2012 6House rule XI, clause (2)(m)(1)(B). 7House rule XI, clause (2)(m)(3)(A)(i). 8E-mail from [Dep’t of Justice] on behalf of Dep- uty Att’y Gen. David Ogden to Kathryn Ruemmler, et al. (Oct. 26, 2009). 9Transcribed Interview of Special Agent Peter Forcelli, at 53–54 (Apr. 28, 2011). 10E-mail from Kevin Simpson, Intelligence Officer, Phoenix FIG, ATF, to David Voth (Dec. 18, 2009). 11Id. 12Id. witnesses and the production of such books, records, correspondence, memoranda, papers, and documents as it considers necessary.’’ 6 The rule further provides that the ‘‘power to authorize and issue subpoenas’’ may be dele-gated to the Committee chairman. 7The sub- poenas discussed in this report were issued pursuant to this authority. The Committee’s investigation into ac- tions by senior officials in the U.S. Depart-ment of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) in designing, implementing, and supervising the execution of Operation Fast and Furious, and subsequently providing false denials to Congress, is being undertaken pursuant to the authority delegated to the Committee under House Rule X as described above. The oversight and legislative purposes of the investigations are (1) to examine and ex-pose any possible malfeasance, abuse of au-thority, or violation of existing law on the part of the executive branch with regard to the conception and implementation of Oper-ation Fast and Furious, and (2) based on the results of the investigation, to assess wheth-er the conduct uncovered may warrant addi-tions or modifications to federal law and to make appropriate legislative recommenda-tions. In particular, the Committee’s investiga- tion has highlighted the need to obtain infor-mation that will aid Congress in considering whether a revision of the statutory provi-sions governing the approval of federal wire-tap applications may be necessary. The major breakdown in the process that oc-curred with respect to the Fast and Furious wiretap applications necessitates careful ex-amination of the facts before proposing a legislative remedy. Procedural improve-ments may need to be codified in statute to mandate immediate action in the face of highly objectionable information relating to operational tactics and details contained in future applications. The Committee’s investigation has called into question the ability of ATF to carry out its statutory mission and the ability of the Department of Justice to adequately super-vise it. The information sought is needed to consider legislative remedies to restructure ATF as needed. III. BACKGROUND ON THE COMMITTEE’S INVESTIGATION In February 2011, the Oversight and Gov- ernment Reform Committee joined Senator Charles E. Grassley, Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, in in-vestigating Operation Fast and Furious, a program conducted by ATF. On March 16, 2011, Chairman Darrell Issa wrote to then- Acting ATF Director Kenneth E. Melson re-questing documents and information regard-ing Fast and Furious. Responding for Melson and ATF, the Department of Justice did not provide any documents or information to the Committee by the March 30, 2011, deadline. The Committee issued a subpoena to Melson the next day. The Department produced zero pages of non-public documents pursuant to that subpoena until June 10, 2011, on the eve of the Committee’s first Fast and Furious hearing. On June 13, 2011, the Committee held a hearing entitled ‘‘Obstruction of Justice: Does the Justice Department Have to Re-spond to a Lawfully Issued and Valid Con-gressional Subpoena?’’ The Committee held a second hearing on June 15, 2011, entitled ‘‘Operation Fast and Furious: Reckless Deci-sions, Tragic Outcomes.’’ The Committee held a third hearing on July 26, 2011, entitled ‘‘Operation Fast and Furious: The Other Side of the Border.’’ On October 11, 2011, the Justice Depart- ment informed the Committee its document production pursuant to the March 31, 2011, subpoena was complete. The next day, the Committee issued a detailed subpoena to At-torney General Eric Holder for additional documents related to Fast and Furious. On February 2, 2012, the Committee held a hearing entitled ‘‘Fast and Furious: Manage-ment Failures at the Department of Jus-tice.’’ The Attorney General testified at that hearing. The Committee has issued two staff re- ports documenting its initial investigative findings. The first, The Department of Justice’s Operation Fast and Furious: Accounts of ATF Agents , was released on June 14, 2011. The second, The Department of Justice’s Operation Fast and Furious: Fueling Cartel Violence, was released on July 26, 2011. Throughout the investigation, the Com- mittee has made numerous attempts to ac-commodate the interests of the Department of Justice. Committee staff has conducted numerous meetings and phone conversations with Department lawyers to clarify and highlight priorities with respect to the sub-poenas. Committee staff has been flexible in scheduling dates for transcribed interviews; agreed to review certain documents in cam- era; allowed extensions of production dead- lines; agreed to postpone interviewing the Department’s key Fast and Furious trial witness; and narrowed the scope of docu-ments the Department must produce to be in compliance with the subpoena and to avoid contempt proceedings. Despite the Committee’s flexibility, the Department has refused to produce certain documents to the Committee. The Depart-ment has represented on numerous occasions that it will not produce broad categories of documents. The Department has not pro-vided a privilege log delineating with par-ticularity why certain documents are being withheld. The Department’s efforts at accommoda- tion and ability to work with the Committee regarding its investigation into Fast and Fu-rious have been wholly inadequate. The Com-mittee requires the subpoenaed documents to meet its constitutionally mandated over-sight and legislative duties. IV. OPERATION FAST AND FURIOUS: BREAKDOWNS AT ALL LEVELS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE The story of Operation Fast and Furious is one of widespread dysfunction across numer-ous components of the Department of Jus-tice. This dysfunction allowed Fast and Furi-ous to originate and grow at a local level be-fore senior officials at Department of Justice headquarters ultimately approved and au-thorized it. The dysfunction within and among Department components continues to this day. A. T HEATF P HOENIX FIELD DIVISION In October 2009, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General (ODAG) in Washington, D.C. promulgated a new strategy to combat gun trafficking along the Southwest Border. This new strategy directed federal law en-forcement to shift its focus away from seiz-ing firearms from criminals as soon as pos-sible, and to focus instead on identifying members of trafficking networks. The Office of the Deputy Attorney General shared this strategy with the heads of many Department components, including ATF. 8 Members of the ATF Phoenix Field Divi- sion, led by Special Agent in Charge Bill Newell, became familiar with this new strat-egy and used it in creating Fast and Furious. In mid-November 2009, just weeks after the strategy was issued, Fast and Furious began. Its objective was to establish a nexus be-tween straw purchasers of firearms in the United States and Mexican drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs) operating on both sides of the United States-Mexico border. Straw purchasers are individuals who are legally entitled to purchase firearms for themselves, but who unlawfully purchase weapons with the intent to transfer them to someone else, in this case DTOs or other criminals. During Fast and Furious, ATF agents used an investigative technique known as ‘‘gunwalking’’—that is, allowing illegally- purchased weapons to be transferred to third parties without attempting to disrupt or deter the illegal activity. ATF agents aban-doned surveillance on known straw pur-chasers after they illegally purchased weap-ons that ATF agents knew were destined for Mexican drug cartels. Many of these trans-actions established probable cause for agents to interdict the weapons or arrest the posses-sors, something every agent was trained to do. Yet, Fast and Furious aimed instead to allow the transfer of these guns to third par-ties. In this manner, the guns fell into the hands of DTOs, and many would turn up at crime scenes. ATF then traced these guns to their original straw purchaser, in an attempt to establish a connection between that indi-vidual and the DTO. Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs), who cooperated with ATF, were an integral com-ponent of Fast and Furious. Although some FFLs were reluctant to continue selling weapons to suspicious straw purchasers, ATF encouraged them to do so, reassuring the FFLs that ATF was monitoring the buyers and that the weapons would not fall into the wrong hands. 9ATF worked with FFLs on or about the date of sale to obtain the unique serial number of each firearm sold. Agents entered these serial numbers into ATF’s Sus-pect Gun Database within days after the pur-chase. Once these firearms were recovered at crime scenes, the Suspect Gun Database al-lowed for expedited tracing of the firearms to their original purchasers. By December 18, 2009, ATF agents assigned to Fast and Furious had already identified fifteen interconnected straw purchasers in the targeted gun trafficking ring. These straw purchasers had already purchased 500 firearms. 10In a biweekly update to Bill New- ell, ATF Group Supervisor David Voth ex-plained that 50 of the 500 firearms purchased by straw buyers had already been recovered in Mexico or near the Mexican border. 11 These guns had time-to-crimes of as little as one day, strongly indicating straw pur-chasing. 12 Starting in late 2009, many line agents ob- jected vociferously to some of the techniques used during Fast and Furious, including gunwalking. The investigation continued for another year, however, until shortly after December 15, 2010, when two weapons from Fast and Furious were recovered at the mur-der scene of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. Pursuant to the Deputy Attorney Gen- eral’s strategy, in late January 2010 the ATF Phoenix Field Division applied for Fast and Furious to become an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) case. In preparation for the OCDETF application process, the ATF Phoenix Field Division pre-pared a briefing paper detailing the inves-tigative strategy employed in Fast and Furi-ous.

The briefing paper stated: Currently our strategy is to allow the transfer of firearms to continue to take place, albeit at a much slower pace, in order to further the investigation and allow for the identification of additional co-conspirators who would continue to operate and illegally traffic firearms to Mexican DTOs which are perpetrating armed violence along the Southwest Border. 13 Fast and Furious was approved as an OCDETF case, and this designation resulted in new operational funding. Additionally, Fast and Furious became a prosecutor-led OCDETF Strike Force case, meaning that ATF would join with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Adminis-tration, Internal Revenue Service, and Im-migrations and Customs Enforcement under the leadership of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona. B. T HEUNITED STATES ATTORNEY ’SOFFICE FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona led the Fast and Furious OCDETF Strike Force. Although ATF was the lead law enforcement agency for Fast and Furi-ous, its agents took direction from prosecu-tors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The lead federal prosecutor for Fast and Furious was Assistant U.S. Attorney Emory Hurley, who played an integral role in the day-to-day, tactical management of the case. 14 Many ATF agents working on Operation Fast and Furious came to believe that some of the most basic law enforcement tech-niques used to interdict weapons required the explicit approval of the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and specifically from Hurley. On nu-merous occasions, Hurley and other federal prosecutors withheld this approval, to the mounting frustration of ATF agents. 15The U.S. Attorney’s Office chose not to use other available investigative tools common in gun trafficking cases, such as civil forfeitures and seizure warrants, during the seminal pe-riods of Fast and Furious. The U.S. Attorney’s Office advised ATF that agents needed to meet unnecessarily strict evidentiary standards in order to speak with suspects, temporarily detain them, or interdict weapons. ATF’s reliance on this advice from the U.S. Attorney’s Of-fice during Fast and Furious resulted in many lost opportunities to interdict weap-ons. In addition to leading the Fast and Furious OCDETF task force, the U.S. Attorney’s Of- fice was instrumental in preparing the wire-tap applications that were submitted to the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. Federal prosecutors in Arizona filed at least six of these applications, each containing immense detail about operational tactics and specific information about straw pur-chasers, in federal court after Department headquarters authorized them. C. ATF H EADQUARTERS Fast and Furious first came to the atten- tion of ATF Headquarters on December 8, 2009, just weeks after the case was officially opened in Phoenix. ATF’s Office of Strategic Information and Intelligence (OSII) briefed senior ATF personnel about the case on De-cember 8, 2009, discussing in detail a large re-covery of Fast and Furious weapons in Naco, Sonora, Mexico. 16 The next day, December 9, 2009, the Acting ATF Director first learned about Fast and Furious and the large recovery of weapons that had already occurred. 17The following week, OSII briefed senior ATF officials about another large cache of Fast and Furious weapons that had been recovered in Mexico. 18 On January 5, 2010, OSII presented senior ATF officials with a summary of all of the weapons that could be linked to known straw purchasers in Fast and Furious. In just two months, these straw purchasers bought a total of 685 guns. This number raised the ire of several individuals in the room, who ex-pressed concerns about the growing oper-ation. 19 On March 5, 2010, ATF headquarters hosted a larger, more detailed briefing on Operation Fast and Furious. David Voth, the Group Su-pervisor overseeing Fast and Furious, trav-eled from Phoenix to give the presentation. He gave an extremely detailed synopsis of the status of the investigation, including the number of guns purchased, weapons seizures to date, money spent by straw purchasers, and organizational charts of the relation-ships among straw purchasers and to mem-bers of the Sinaloa drug cartel. At that point, the straw purchasers had bought 1,026 weapons, costing nearly $650,000. 20 NATF’s Phoenix Field Division informed ATF headquarters of large weapons recov-eries tracing back to Fast and Furious. The Phoenix Field Division had frequently for-warded these updates directly to Deputy ATF Director Billy Hoover and Acting ATF Director Ken Melson. 21When Hoover learned about how large Fast and Furious had grown in March 2010, he finally ordered the develop-ment of an exit strategy. 22This exit strat- egy, something Hoover had never before re-quested in any other case, was a timeline for ATF to wind down the case. 23 Though Hoover commissioned the exit strategy in March, he did not receive it until early May. The three-page document out-lined a 30-, 60-, and 90-day strategy for wind-ing down Fast and Furious and handing it over to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for pros-ecution. 24 In July 2010, Acting Director Melson ex- pressed concern about the number of weap-ons flowing to Mexico, 25and in October 2010 the Assistant Director for Field Operations, the number three official in ATF, expressed concern that ATF had not yet halted the straw purchasing activity in Fast and Furi-ous. 26Despite these concerns, however, the U.S. Attorney’s Office continued to delay the indictments, and no one at ATF head-quarters ordered the Phoenix Field Division to simply arrest the straw purchasers in order to take them off the street. The mem-bers of the firearms trafficking ring were not arrested until two weapons from Fast and Furious were found at the murder scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. D. T HECRIMINAL DIVISION COORDINATION WITH ATF In early September 2009, according to De- partment e-mails, ATF and the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division began discus-sions ‘‘to talk about ways CRM [Criminal Di-vision] and ATF can coordinate on gun traf-ficking and gang-related initiatives.’’ 27 Early on in these discussions, Lanny Breuer, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, sent an attorney to help the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Arizona prosecute ATF cases. The first case chosen for prosecution was Operation Wide Receiver, a year-long ATF Phoenix Field Division investigation initiated in 2006, which involved several hun-dred guns being walked. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Arizona, objecting to the tactics used in Wide Receiver, had previously re-fused to prosecute the case. According to James Trusty, a senior offi- cial in the Criminal Division’s Gang Unit, in September 2009 Assistant Attorney General Breuer was ‘‘VERY interested in the Arizona gun trafficking case [Wide Receiver], and he is traveling out [to Arizona] around 9/21. Consequently, he asked us for a ‘briefing’ on that case before the 21st rolls around.’’ 28The next day, according to Trusty, Breuer’s chief of staff ‘‘mentioned the case again, so there is clearly great attention/interest from the front office.’’ 29 When the Criminal Division prosecutor ar- rived in Arizona, she gave Trusty her impres-sions of the case. Her e-mail stated: Case involves 300 to 500 guns .... I t i s m y understanding that a lot of these guns ‘‘walked’’. Whether some or all of that was intentional is not known. 30 Discussions between ATF and the Criminal Division regarding inter-departmental co-ordination continued over the next few months. On December 3, 2009, the Acting ATF Director e-mailed Breuer about this co-operation. He stated: Lanny: We have decided to take a little dif- ferent approach with regard to seizures of multiple weapons in Mexico. Assuming the guns are traced, instead of working each trace almost independently of the other traces from the seizure, I want to coordinate and monitor the work on all of them collec-tively as if the seizure was one case. 31 Breuer responded: We think this is a terrific idea and a great way to approach the investigations of these seizures. Our Gang Unit will be assigning an attorney to help you coordinate this effort. 32 Kevin Carwile, Chief of the Gang Unit, as- signed an attorney, Joe Cooley, to assist ATF, and Operation Fast and Furious was se-lected as a recipient of this assistance. Shortly after his assignment, Cooley had to rearrange his holiday plans to attend a sig-nificant briefing on Fast and Furious. 33 Cooley was assigned to Fast and Furious for the next three months. He advised the lead federal prosecutor, Emory Hurley, and received detailed briefings on operational de-tails. Cooley, though, was not the only Criminal Division attorney involved with VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

The head of the division, Lanny Breuer, met with ATF officials about the case, including Deputy Director Billy Hoover and Assistant Director for Field Operations Mark Chait. 34 Given the initial involvement of the Crimi- nal Division with Fast and Furious in the early stages of the investigation, senior offi-cials in Criminal Division should have been greatly alarmed about what they learned about the case. These officials should have halted the program, especially given their prior knowledge of gunwalking in Wide Re-ceiver, which was run by the same leadership in the same ATF field division. On March 5, 2010, Cooley attended a brief- ing about Fast and Furious. The detailed briefing highlighted the large number of weapons the gun trafficking ring had pur-chased and discussed recoveries of those weapons in Mexico. According to Steve Mar-tin, Deputy Assistant Director in ATF’s Of-fice of Strategic Intelligence and Informa-tion, everyone in the room knew the weap-ons from Fast and Furious were being linked to a Mexican cartel. 35Two weeks later, in mid-March 2010, Carwile pulled Cooley off Fast and Furious, when the U.S. Attorney’s Office informed him that it had the case under control. 36 WIRETAPS At about the same time, senior lawyers in the Criminal Division authorized wiretap ap-plications for Fast and Furious to be sub-mitted to a federal judge. Fast and Furious involved the use of seven wiretaps between March and July of 2010. In a letter to Chairman Issa, the Deputy Attorney General acknowledged that the Of-fice of Enforcement Operations (OEO), part of the Justice Department’s Criminal Divi-sion, is ‘‘primarily responsible for the De-partment’s statutory wiretap authoriza-tions.’’ 37According to the letter, lawyers in OEO review these wiretap packages to ensure that they ‘‘meet statutory requirements and DOJ policies.’’ 38When OEO completes its re- view of a wiretap package, federal law pro-vides that the Attorney General or his des-ignee—in practice, a Deputy Assistant Attor-ney General in the Criminal Division—re-views and authorizes it. 39Each wiretap pack- age includes an affidavit which details the factual basis upon which the authorization is sought. Each application for Fast and Furi-ous included a memorandum from Assistant Attorney General Breuer to Paul O’Brien, Director of OEO, authorizing the intercep-tion application. 40 The Criminal Division’s approval of the wiretap applications in Fast and Furious vio-lated Department of Justice policy. The core mission of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives is to ‘‘protect[ ] our communities from . . . the illegal use and trafficking of firearms.’’ 41 The wiretap applications document the ex- tensive involvement of the Criminal Division in Fast and Furious. These applications were constructed from raw data contained in hun- dreds of Reports of Investigation (ROI); the Department of Justice failed to produce any of these ROI in response to the Committee’s subpoena. The Criminal Division authorized Fast and Furious wiretap applications on March 10, 2010; April 15, 2010; May 6, 2010; May 14, 2010; June 1, 2010; and July 1, 2010. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, Deputy Assistant Attorney Gen-eral Kenneth Blanco, and Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Keeney signed these applications on behalf of Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer. E. T HEOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL The Office of the Deputy Attorney General (ODAG) maintained close involvement in Op-eration Fast and Furious. In the Justice De-partment, ATF reports to the Deputy Attor-ney General (DAG). 42In practice, an official in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General is responsible for managing the ATF port-folio. This official monitors the operations of ATF, and raises potential ATF issues to the attention of the DAG. 43During the pendency of Fast and Furious, this official was Asso-ciate Deputy Attorney General Edward Siskel. Officials in ODAG became familiar with Fast and Furious as early as March 2010. On March 12, 2010, Siskel and then-Acting DAG Gary Grindler received an extensive briefing on Fast and Furious during a monthly meet-ing with the ATF’s Acting Director and Dep-uty Director. This briefing presented Grindler with overwhelming evidence of ille-gal straw purchasing during Fast and Furi-ous. The presentation included a chart of the names of the straw purchasers, 31 in all, and the number of weapons they had acquired to date, 1,026. 44Three of these straw purchasers had already purchased over 100 weapons each, with one straw purchaser having al-ready acquired over 300 weapons. During this briefing, Grindler learned that buyers had paid cash for every single gun. 45 A map of Mexico detailed locations of re- coveries of weapons purchased through Fast and Furious, including some at crime scenes. 46The briefing also covered the use of stash houses where weapons bought during Fast and Furious were stored before being transported to Mexico. Grindler learned of some of the unique investigative techniques ATF was using during Fast and Furious. 47 Despite receiving all of this information, then-Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler did not order Fast and Furious to be shut down, nor did he follow-up with ATF or his staff about the investigation. Throughout the summer of 2010, ATF offi- cials remained in close contact with their ODAG supervisors regarding Fast and Furi-ous. Fast and Furious was a topic in each of the monthly meetings between ATF and the DAG. ATF apprised Ed Siskel of significant recoveries of Fast and Furious weapons, as well as of notable progress in the investiga-tion, and Siskel indicated to ATF that he was monitoring it. 48In mid-December 2010, after Fast and Furious had been ongoing for over a year, Grindler received more details about the program. On December 15, 2010, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed. Two Fast and Furious weapons were recov- ered at the scene of his murder. Two days later, Associate Deputy Attorney General Brad Smith sent Grindler and four ODAG of-ficials an e-mail detailing the circumstances of Terry’s murder and its connection to Fast and Furious. 49Smith attached a four-page summary of the Fast and Furious investiga-tion. V. THE COMMITTEE’S OCTOBER 12, 2011, SUBPOENA TO ATTORNEY GENERAL HOLDER On October 12, 2011, the Committee issued a subpoena to Attorney General Eric Holder, demanding documents related to the Depart-ment of Justice’s involvement with Oper-ation Fast and Furious. The subpoena was issued following six months of constant re-fusals by the Justice Department to cooper-ate with the Committee’s investigation into Operation Fast and Furious. A. E VENTS LEADING UPT OT H E SUBPOENA On March 16, 2011, Chairman Issa sent a letter to then-ATF Acting Director Ken Melson asking for information and docu-ments pertaining to Operation Fast and Fu-rious. 50Late in the afternoon of March 30, 2011, the Department, on behalf of ATF and Melson, informed the Committee that it would not provide any documents pursuant to the letter. The Committee informed the Department it planned to issue a subpoena. On March 31, 2011, the Committee issued a subpoena to Ken Melson for the documents. On May 2, 2011, Committee staff reviewed documents the Department made available for in camera review at Department head-quarters. Many of these documents con-tained partial or full redactions. Following this review, Chairman Issa wrote to the De-partment on May 5, 2011, asking the Depart-ment to produce all documents responsive to the Committee’s subpoena forthwith. 51That same day, senior Department officials met with Committee staff and acknowledged ‘‘there’s a there, there’’ regarding the legit-imacy of the congressional inquiry into Fast and Furious. In spite of Chairman Issa’s May 5, 2011, let- ter, during the two months following the issuance of the subpoena, the Department produced zero pages of non-public docu-ments. On June 8, 2011, the Committee again wrote to the Department requesting com-plete production of all documents by June 10, 2011. 52The Department responded on June 10, 2011, stating ‘‘complete production of all doc-uments by June 10, 2011, . . . is not pos-sible.’’ 53At 7:49 p.m. that evening, just three days before a scheduled Committee hearing on the obligation of the Department of Jus-tice to cooperate with congressional over-sight, the Department finally produced its first non-public documents to the Com-mittee, totaling 69 pages. 54 Over the next six weeks, through July 21, 2011, the Department produced an additional 1,286 pages of documents. The Department produced no additional documents until Sep-tember 1, 2011, when it produced 193 pages of VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

Many of the documents the whistleblowers provided were not among the 2,050 pages that the Department had pro-duced by October 11, 2011, demonstrating that the Department was withholding mate-rials responsive to the subpoena. The Committee requested additional docu- ments from the Department as the investiga-tion proceeded during the summer of 2011. On July 11, 2011, Chairman Issa and Senator Grassley wrote to the Attorney General re-questing documents from twelve people in Justice Department headquarters pertaining to Fast and Furious. 58The Justice Depart- ment first responded to this letter on Octo-ber 31, 2011, nearly four months later. 59 On July 11, 2011, Chairman Issa and Sen- ator Grassley sent a letter to the FBI re-questing documents relating to the FBI’s role in the Fast and Furious OCDETF inves-tigation. 60The letter requested information and documents pertaining to paid FBI in-formants who were the target of the Fast and Furious investigation. The FBI never produced any of the documents requested in this letter. On July 15, 2011, Chairman Issa and Sen- ator Grassley sent a letter to the DEA re-questing documents pertaining to another target of the Fast and Furious investiga-tion. 61The DEA was aware of this target be- fore Fast and Furious became an OCDETF case, a fact that raises serious questions about the lack of information-sharing among Department components. Though DEA re-sponded to the letter on July 22, 2011, it, too, did not provide any of the requested docu-ments. 62 On September 1, 2011, Chairman Issa and Senator Grassley wrote to the Acting U.S. Attorney in Arizona requesting documents and communications pertaining to Fast and Furious. 63As the office responsible for lead- ing Fast and Furious, the Arizona U.S. At-torney’s Office possesses a large volume of documents relevant to the Committee’s in-vestigation. The Department of Justice, on behalf of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona, did not respond to this letter until December 6, 2011, the eve of the Attorney General’s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee. 64 On September 27, 2011, Chairman Issa and Senator Grassley sent a letter to the Attor-ney General raising questions about informa-tion-sharing among Department compo- nents, the Department’s cooperation with Congress, and FBI documents requested in the July 11, 2011, letter to FBI Director Mueller. 65To date, the Department has not responded to this letter. The Department wrote to Chairman Issa on October 11, 2011, stating it had ‘‘substan-tially concluded [its] efforts to respond to the Committee requests set forth in the sub-poena and the letter of June 8th.’’ 66The let- ter further stated: [O]ther documents have not been produced or made available for these same reasons be-cause neither redacting them nor making them available for review (as opposed to pro-duction) was sufficient to address our con-cerns. Our disclosure of the vast majority of the withheld material is prohibited by stat-ute. These records pertain to matters occur-ring before a grand jury, as well as investiga-tive activities under seal or the disclosure of which is prohibited by law . . . we also have not disclosed certain confidential investiga-tive and prosecutorial documents, the disclo-sure of which would, in our judgment, com-promise the pending criminal investigations and prosecution. These include core inves-tigative and prosecutorial material, such as Reports of Investigation and drafts of court filings. Finally . . . we have also withheld internal communications that were generated in the course of the Department’s effort to respond to congressional and media inquiries about Operation Fast and Furious. These records were created in 2011, well after the comple-tion of the investigative portion of Operation Fast and Furious that the Committee has been reviewing and after the charging deci-sions reflected in the January 25, 2011, in- dictments. Thus, they were not part of the communications regarding the development and implementation of the strategy deci-sions that have not been the focus of the Committee’s inquiry . . . Disclosure would have a chilling effect on agency officials’ de-liberations about how to respond to inquiries from Congress or the media. Such a chill on internal communications would interfere with our ability to respond as effectively and efficiently as possible to congressional over-sight requests. 67 The following day, on October 12, 2011, after the Department announced its inten-tion to cease producing documents respon-sive to the Committee’s March 31, 2011, sub-poena to Melson, the Committee issued a subpoena to Attorney General Eric Holder demanding documents relating to Fast and Furious. B. S UBPOENA SCHEDULE REQUESTS In the weeks following the issuance of the subpoena, Committee staff worked closely with Department lawyers to provide clari-fications about subpoena categories, and to assist the Department in prioritizing docu-ments for production. Committee and De-partment staff engaged in discussions span-ning several weeks to enable the Department to better understand what the Committee was specifically seeking. During these con-versations, the Committee clearly articu-lated its investigative priorities as reflected in the subpoena schedule. The Department memorialized these priorities with speci-ficity in an October 31, 2011, e-mail from the Office of Legislative Affairs. 68 Despite the Department’s acknowledge- ment that it understands what the Com-mittee was seeking, it has yet to provide a single document for 11 out of the 22 cat-egories contained in the subpoena schedule. The Department has not adequately com-plied with the Committee’s subpoena, and it has unequivocally stated its refusal to com-ply with entire categories of the subpoena al-together. In a letter to Chairman Issa on May 15, 2012, the Department stated that it had delivered or made available for review documents responsive to 13 of the 22 cat-egories of the subpoena. 69 A review of each of the 22 schedule cat- egories in the subpoena reflects the Depart-ment’s clear understanding of the documents sought by the Committee for each category. Below is a listing of each category of the subpoena schedule, followed by what the De-partment has explained is its understanding of what the Committee is seeking for each category. All communications referring or relating to Operation Fast and Furious, the Jacob Chambers case, or any Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) firearms trafficking case based in Phoenix, Arizona, to or from the following individuals: a. Eric Holder, Jr., Attorney General; b. David Ogden, Former Deputy Attorney General; c. Gary Grindler, Office of the Attorney General and former Acting Deputy Attorney General; d. James Cole, Deputy Attorney General; e. Lanny Breuer, Assistant Attorney Gen- eral; f. Ronald Weich, Assistant Attorney Gen- eral; g. Kenneth Blanco, Deputy Assistant At- torney General; h. Jason Weinstein, Deputy Assistant At- torney General; i. John Keeney, Deputy Assistant Attorney General; j. Bruce Swartz, Deputy Assistant Attor- ney General; k. Matt Axelrod, Associate Deputy Attor- ney General; l. Ed Siskel, former Associate Deputy At- torney General; m. Brad Smith, Office of the Deputy Attor- ney General; n. Kevin Carwile, Section Chief, Capital Case Unit, Criminal Division; o. Joseph Cooley, Criminal Fraud Section, Criminal Division; and, p. James Trusty, Acting Chief, Organized Crime and Gang Section. Department Response: In late October 2011, the Department acknowledged that it had ‘‘already begun searches of some of the custodians listed here relating to Fast and Furious, such as in response to the Chair-man’s letter of 7/11/11.’’ 70Still, it has pro- duced no documents since the issuance of the subpoena pursuant to subpoena categories 1(a), 1(b), 1(g), 1(i), and 1(k), only two docu-ments pursuant to subpoena category 1(d), and very few documents pursuant to sub-poena category 1(j) and 1(l). All communications between and among Department of Justice (DOJ) employees and Executive Office of the President employees, including but not limited to Associate Com-munications Director Eric Schultz, referring or relating to Operation Fast and Furious or any other firearms trafficking cases. Department Response: The Department ac- knowledged that the Committee identified several people likely to be custodians of VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4182 June 28, 2012 71Id. 72May 15 Cole Letter, at 4. 73Id. 74Id. 75Id. 76May 15 Cole Letter, at 4. 77Sharyl Attkisson, Second gun used in ICE agent murder linked to ATF undercover operation, (Feb. 22, 2012, 5:29 P.M.), http://www.cbsnews.com/8301- 31727 _162-57383089-10391695/second-gun-used-in-ice- agent-murder-linked-to-atf-undercover-operation/. 78Id. 79OLA e-mail, supra note 68. 80Id. 81Id. 82Id. 83Id. 84Id. these documents.71Though the Department has stated it has produced documents pursu-ant to this subpoena category, the Com-mittee has not found any documents pro-duced by the Department responsive to this subpoena category. 72 All communications between DOJ em- ployees and Executive Office of the President employees referring or relating to the Presi-dent’s March 22, 2011, interview with Jorge Ramos of Univision. Department Response: The Department rep- resented that it would ‘‘check on commu-nications with WH Press Office in the time period preceding the President’s 3/22/11 inter-view,’’ and that it had identified the most likely custodians of those documents. 73 Nonetheless, it has produced no documents responsive to this subpoena category. The Department has not informed the Committee that no documents exist responsive to this schedule number. All documents and communications re- ferring or relating to any instances prior to February 4, 2011, where the Bureau of Alco-hol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) failed to interdict weapons that had been il-legally purchased or transferred. Department Response: The Department has produced some documents responsive to this subpoena category. All documents and communications re- ferring or relating to any instances prior to February 4, 2011, where ATF broke off sur-veillance of weapons and subsequently be-came aware that those weapons entered Mex-ico. Department Response: The Department has produced documents responsive to this sub-poena category. Most of the responsive documents the De- partment has produced pursuant to the sub-poena pertain to categories 4 and 5 and re-late to earlier cases the Department has de-scribed as involving gunwalking. The De-partment produced these documents strate-gically, advancing its own narrative about why Fast and Furious was neither an iso-lated nor a unique program. It has attempted to accomplish this objective by simulta-neously producing documents to the media and the Committee. All documents and communications re- ferring or relating to the murder of Immigra-tions and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata, including, but not limited to, docu-ments and communications regarding Zapata’s mission when he was murdered, Form for Reporting Information That May Become Testimony (FD–302), photographs of the crime scene, and investigative reports prepared by the FBI. Department Response: The Department ‘‘understand[s] that the Zapata family has complained that they’ve been ‘kept in the dark’ about this matter’’ which necessitated this subpoena category. 74The Department ‘‘conferred with the U.S. Attorney’s Office . . . which we hope will be helpful to them and perhaps address the concerns that are the basis of this item.’’ 75Though the Depart- ment has stated it has produced documents pursuant to this subpoena category, the Committee has not found any documents produced by the Department responsive to this subpoena category. 76 In late February 2012, press accounts re- vealed that prosecutors had recently sen-tenced a second individual in relation to the murder of Immigration and Customs En-forcement (ICE) Agent Jaime Zapata. One news article stated that ‘‘[n]obody was more astonished to learn of the case than Zapata’s parents, who didn’t know that [the defend-ant] had been arrested or linked to their son’s murder.’’ 77Press accounts alleged that the defendant had been ‘‘under ATF surveil-lance for at least six months before a rifle he trafficked was used in Zapata’s murder’’—a situation similar to what took place during Fast and Furious. 78Despite this revelation, the Department failed to produce any docu-ments responsive to this subpoena category. All communications to or from William Newell, former Special Agent-in-Charge for ATF’s Phoenix Field Division, between: a. December 14, 2010 to January 25, 2011; and, b. March 16, 2009 to March 19, 2009. Department Response: The Department has not produced any documents responsive to subpoena category 7(b), despite its under-standing that the Committee sought docu-ments pertaining ‘‘to communications with [Executive Office of the President] staff re-garding gun control policy’’ within a specific and narrow timeframe. 79The Department has not informed the Committee that no doc-uments exist responsive to this schedule number. All Reports of Investigation (ROIs) re- lated to Operation Fast and Furious or ATF Case Number 785115–10–0004. Department Response: Department rep- resentatives contended that this subpoena category ‘‘presents some significant issues for’’ the Department due to current and po-tential future indictments. 80The Depart- ment has not produced any documents re-sponsive to this subpoena category. The De-partment has not informed the Committee that no documents exist responsive to this schedule number. All communications between and among Matt Axelrod, Kenneth Melson, and William Hoover referring or relating to ROIs identi-fied pursuant to Paragraph 8. Department Response: The Department ac- knowledged its understanding that this re-quest specifically pertained to ‘‘emails Ken sent to Matt and Billy, expressing concerns, perhaps in March 2011, [that] are core to [the Committee’s] work, and we’ll look at those.’’ 81Still, it has produced no documents pursuant to this subpoena category. The De-partment has not informed the Committee that no documents exist responsive to this schedule number. All documents and communications be- tween and among former U.S. Attorney Den-nis Burke, Attorney General Eric Holder, Jr., former Acting Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler, Deputy Attorney General James Cole, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, and Deputy Assistant Attor-ney General Jason Weinstein referring or re-lating to Operation Fast and Furious or any OCDETF case originating in Arizona. Department Response: The Department has produced some documents responsive to this subpoena category. A complete production of these documents is crucial to allow Congress to understand how senior Department officials came to know that the February 4, 2011, letter to Senator Grassley was false, why it took so long for the Department to withdraw the let-ter despite months of congressional pressure to do so, and why the Department obstructed the congressional investigation for nearly a year. These documents will show the reac-tions of top officials when confronted with evidence about gunwalking in Fast and Furi-ous. The documents will also show whether these officials knew about, or were surprised to learn of, the gunwalking. Additionally, these documents will reveal the identities of Department officials who orchestrated var-ious forms of retaliation against the whistle- blowers. All communications sent or received be- tween: a. December 16, 2009 and December 18, 2009; and, b. March 9, 2011, and March 14, 2011, to or from the following individuals: i. Emory Hurley, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona; ii. Michael Morrissey, Assistant U.S. At- torney, Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona; iii. Patrick Cunningham, Chief, Criminal Division, Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona; iv. David Voth, Group Supervisor, ATF; and, v. Hope MacAllister, Special Agent, ATF. Department Response: The Department ac- knowledged that it ‘‘will first search these custodians for records re a) the Howard meeting in 12/09; and b) the ROI or memo that was written during this time period re-lating to the Howard mtng in 12/09.’’ 82Al- though the Department has produced docu-ments that are purportedly responsive to this category, these documents do not per-tain to the subject matter that the Depart-ment understands that the Committee is seeking. All communications sent or received be- tween December 15, 2010, and December 17, 2010, to or from the following individuals in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona: a. Dennis Burke, former United States At- torney; b. Emory Hurley, Assistant United States Attorney; c. Michael Morrissey, Assistant United States Attorney; and, d. Patrick Cunningham, Chief of the Crimi- nal Division. Department Response: The Department un- derstood that the Committee’s ‘‘primary in-terest here is in the communications during this time period that relate to the Terry death and, per our conversation, we will start with those.’’ 83Although the Depart- ment has produced some documents respon-sive to this subpoena category, it has not represented that it has produced all respon-sive documents in this category. All communications sent or received be- tween August 7, 2009, and March 19, 2011, be-tween and among former Ambassador to Mexico Carlos Pascual; Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer; and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bruce Swartz. Department Response: The Department ac- knowledged that it ‘‘understand[s] the Com-mittee’s focus here is Firearms Trafficking issues along the SW Border, not limited to Fast & Furious.’’ 84The Department has pro- duced some documents responsive to this subpoena category. All communications sent or received be- tween August 7, 2009, and March 19, 2011, be-tween and among former Ambassador to Mexico Carlos Pascual and any Department of Justice employee based in Mexico City re-ferring or relating to firearms trafficking initiatives, Operation Fast and Furious or VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4183 June 28, 2012 85Id. 86Id. 87Id. 88Id. 89Id. 90Id. 91Id. 92Id. 93Id. 94Fast and Furious: Management Failures at the De- partment of Justice: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Oversight and Gov’t Reform , 112th Cong. (Feb. 2, 2012) (Statement of Hon. Eric H. Holder, Jr., Att’y Gen. of the U.S.). 95Id. 96On Friday January 27, 2012, just days before the Attorney General testified before Congress, docu-ments were delivered to the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee so late in the evening that a disc of files had to be slipped under the door. This is not only an ex-treme inconvenience for congressional staff but also deprives staff of the ability to review the materials in a timely manner. 972 U.S.C. 192 states, in pertinent part: Every person who having been summoned as a wit- ness by the authority of either House of Congress to give testimony or to produce papers upon any mat-ter under inquiry before . . . any committee of ei-ther House of Congress, willfully makes default . . . shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 nor less than $100 and imprisonment in a common jail for not less than one month nor more than twelve months. any firearms trafficking case based in Ari- zona, or any visits by Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer to Mexico. Department Response: The Department has produced only a handful of pages responsive to this subpoena category, even though it ‘‘understand[s] that [the Committee] wants [the Department] to approach this effort with efficiency.’’ 85Despite the Committee’s request for an efficient effort, the Depart-ment produced a key document regarding Attorney General Lanny Breuer three and a half months after the subpoena was issued, after several previous document productions, and long after Breuer testified before Con-gress and could be questioned about the doc-ument. Given the importance of the contents of the document and the request for an effi-cient effort on the part of the Department in this subpoena category, it is inconceivable that the Department did not discover this document months prior to its production. The Department’s actions suggest that it kept this document hidden for strategic and public relations reasons. Any FD–302 relating to targets, sus- pects, defendants, or their associates, bosses, or financiers in the Fast and Furious inves-tigation, including but not limited to any FD–302s ATF Special Agent Hope MacAllister provided to ATF leadership dur-ing the calendar year 2011. Department Response: The Department ‘‘understand[s] that [the Committee’s] pri-mary focus here is the 5 FBI 302s that were provided to SA MacAllister, which she later gave to Messrs. Hoover and Melson.’’ 86De- spite the specificity of this document re-quest, the Department has not produced any documents responsive to this schedule num-ber. The Department has not informed the Committee that no documents exist respon-sive to this schedule number. Any investigative reports prepared by the FBI or Drug Enforcement Administra-tion (DEA) referring or relating to targets, suspects, or defendants in the Fast and Furi-ous case. Department Response: The Department was ‘‘uncertain about the volume here,’’ regard-ing the amount of documents, and pledged to ‘‘work[ ] on this [with] DEA and FBI.’’ 87De- spite this pledge, it has produced no docu-ments responsive to this subpoena category. The Department has not informed the Com-mittee that no documents exist responsive to this schedule number. Any investigative reports prepared by the FBI or DEA relating to the individuals described to Committee staff at the October 5, 2011, briefing at Justice Department head-quarters as Target Number 1 and Target Number 2. Department Response: The Department ac- knowledged that it ‘‘think[s] we understand this item.’’ 88Despite this understanding, it has produced no documents responsive to this subpoena category. The Department has not informed the Committee that no docu-ments exist responsive to this schedule num-ber. All documents and communications in the possession, custody or control of the DEA referring or relating to Manuel Fabian Celis-Acosta. Department Response: The Department agreed to ‘‘start with records regarding in-formation that DEA shared with ATF about Acosta, which we understand to be the focus of your interest in this item.’’ 89Despite this understanding, the Department has produced no documents responsive to this subpoena category. The Department has not informed the Committee that no documents exist re-sponsive to this schedule number. All documents and communications be- tween and among FBI employees in Arizona and the FBI Laboratory, including but not limited to employees in the Firearms/ Toolmark Unit, referring or relating to the firearms recovered during the course of the investigation of Brian Terry’s death. Department Response: The Department’s un- derstanding was that ‘‘[the Committee’s] focus here is how evidence was tagged at the scene of Agent Terry’s murder, how evidence was processed, how the FBI ballistics report was prepared and what it means.’’ 90Despite this clear understanding, the Department has produced no documents responsive to this subpoena category. The Department has not informed the Committee that no docu-ments exist responsive to this schedule num-ber. All agendas, meeting notes, meeting minutes, and follow-up reports for the Attor-ney General’s Advisory Committee of U.S. Attorneys between March 1, 2009, and July 31, 2011, referring or relating to Operation Fast and Furious. Department Response: This category asks for documents from the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee within a clearly speci-fied date range. Despite the fact that the De-partment has acknowledged this category ‘‘is clear,’’ the Department has produced no documents responsive to this subpoena cat-egory. 91The Department has not informed the Committee that no documents exist re-sponsive to this schedule number. All weekly reports and memoranda for the Attorney General, either directly or through the Deputy Attorney General, from any employee in the Criminal Division, ATF, DEA, FBI, or the National Drug Intelligence Center created between November 1, 2009 and September 30, 2011. Department Response: This category asks for weekly reports and memoranda to the Attorney General from five different Depart-ment components ‘‘regarding ATF cases re firearms trafficking.’’ 92The Department has produced some documents responsive to this subpoena category. All surveillance tapes recorded by pole cameras inside the Lone Wolf Trading Co. store between 12:00 a.m. on October 3, 2010, and 12:00 a.m. on October 7, 2010. Department Response: This category asks for all ATF surveillance tapes from Lone Wolf Trading Company between two speci-fied dates in October 2010. Both the Com-mittee and the Department ‘‘understand a break-in occurred’’ at that time. 93The De- partment has produced no documents respon-sive to this subpoena category. The Depart-ment has not informed the Committee that no documents exist responsive to this sched-ule number. C. A TTEMPTS OF ACCOMMODATION BY THE COM- MITTEE , LACK OF COMPLIANCE BY THE JUS- TICE DEPARTMENT In public statements, the Department has maintained that it remains committed to ‘‘work[ing] to accommodate the Committee’s legitimate oversight needs.’’ 94The Depart- ment, however, believes it is the sole arbiter of what is ‘‘legitimate.’’ In turn, the Com-mittee has gone to great lengths to accom-modate the Department’s interests as an Ex-ecutive Branch agency. Unfortunately, the Department’s actions have not matched its rhetoric. Instead, it has chosen to prolong the investigation and impugn the motives of the Committee. A statement the Attorney General made at the February 2, 2012, hear-ing was emblematic of the Department’s pos-ture with respect to the investigation: But I also think that if we are going to really get ahead here, if we are really going to make some progress, we need to put aside the political gotcha games in an election year and focus on matters that are ex-tremely serious. 95 This attitude with respect to a legitimate congressional inquiry has permeated the De- partment’s ranks. Had the Department dem-onstrated a willingness to cooperate with this investigation from the outset—instead of attempting to cover up its own internal mismanagement—this investigation likely would have concluded well before the elec-tion year even began. The Department has intentionally withheld documents for months, only to release a selected few on the eve of the testimony of Department offi-cials. 96The Department has impeded the ability of a co-equal branch of government to perform its constitutional duty to conduct Executive Branch oversight. By any meas-ure, it has obstructed and slowed the Com-mittee’s work. The Committee has been unfailingly pa- tient in working with Department represent-atives to obtain information the Committee requires to complete its investigation. The Department’s progress has been unaccept-ably slow in responding to the October 12, 2011, subpoena issued to the Attorney Gen-eral. Complying with the Committee’s sub-poena is not optional. Indeed, the failure to produce documents pursuant to a congres-sional subpoena is a violation of federal law. 97Because the Department has not cited any legal authority as the basis for with-holding documents pursuant to the subpoena its efforts to accommodate the Committee’s constitutional obligation to conduct over-sight of the Executive Branch are incom-plete. IN CAMERA REVIEWS In an attempt to accommodate the Justice Department’s interests, Committee staff has viewed documents responsive to the sub-poena that the Department has identified as sensitive in camera at Department head- quarters. Committee staff has visited the De-partment on April 12, May 4, June 17, Octo-ber 12, and November 3, 2011, as well as on January 30 and February 27, 2012 to view these documents. Many of the documents made available for in camera review, how- ever, have been repetitive in nature. Many other documents seemingly do not contain any sensitive parts that require them to be viewed in camera . Other documents are alto- gether non-responsive to the subpoena. Committee staff has spent dozens of hours at Department headquarters reviewing these VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4184 June 28, 2012 98Letter from Ass’t Att’y Gen. Ronald Weich to Chairman Darrell Issa (May 2, 2011). 99Letter from Ass’t Att’y Gen. Ronald Weich to Chairman Darrell Issa (June 14, 2011). 100Letter from Ass’t Att’y Gen. Ronald Weich to Chairman Darrell Issa (July 18, 2011). 101E-mail from Office of Leg.

Affairs Staff (Mar. 30, 2011). 107Letter from Ass’t Att’y Gen. Ronald Weich to Chairman Darrell Issa (Apr. 1, 2011). documents. In addition, the Department has identified hundreds of other sensitive docu-ments responsive to the subpoena, which it refuses to make available even for in camera review, instead withholding them from the Committee altogether. The Committee has made these accommodations to the Depart-ment at the expense of not being able to make these documents available for review by Committee Members. REDACTED DOCUMENTS The Department has redacted varying por- tions of many of the documents it has pro-duced. These redactions purportedly protect ongoing criminal investigations and prosecu-tions, as well as other sensitive data. The Department has so heavily redacted some documents produced to Congress that they are unintelligible. There appears to be no ob-jective, consistent criteria delineating why some documents were redacted, only pro-vided in camera , or withheld entirely. On the evening of May 2, 2011, Department of Justice representatives notified the Com-mittee that the Department was planning to make approximately 400 pages of documents available for an in camera review at its head- quarters. 98Committee staff went to review those documents on May 4, 2011, only to dis-cover they were partially, or in some cases almost completely, redacted. Since these documents were only made available pursu-ant to Committee’s first subpoena and only on an in camera basis, redactions were inap- propriate and unnecessary. On June 14, 2011, the Department produced 65 pages of documents to the Committee in a production labeled ‘‘Batch 4.’’ 99Of these 65 pages, every single one was at least partially redacted, 44 were completely redacted, and 61 had redactions covering more than half of the page. On July 18, 2011, after more than a month of discussions between Committee and De-partment staff, the Department finally in-cluded a redaction code that identifies the reason for each redaction within a docu-ment. 100While the Department has used this redaction code in subsequent document pro-ductions to the Committee, documents pro-duced and redacted prior to July 18, 2011, do not have the benefit of associated redaction codes for each redaction. The Department has over-redacted certain documents. The Committee has obtained many of these documents through whistle-blowers and has compared some of them with those produced by the Department. In some instances, the Department redacted more text than necessary, making it unnecessarily difficult and sometimes impossible for the Committee, absent the documents provided by whistleblowers, to investigate decisions made by Department officials. Further, any documents made available pursuant to the Committee’s subpoenas must not have any redactions. To fully and prop-erly investigate the decisions made by De-partment officials during Fast and Furious, the Committee requires access to documents in their entirety. The Department has not complied with this requirement. The Committee does recognize the impor- tance of privacy interests and other legiti-mate reasons the Department has for redact-ing portions of documents produced to the Committee. The Committee has attempted to accommodate the Department’s stated concerns related to documents it believes are sensitive. The Committee intended to release 230 pages of documents in support of its July 26, 2011, report entitled The Department of Justice’s Operation Fast and Furious: Fueling Cartel Violence , and gave the Department an opportunity to suggest its own redactions before the documents became public. 101 These actions are consistent with the Com-mittee’s willingness to accommodate the De-partment’s interests. PRIVILEGE LOG Mindful of the Justice Department’s pre- rogatives as an Executive Branch agency, the Committee has offered the opportunity for the Department to prepare a privilege log of documents responsive to the subpoena but withheld from production. A privilege log would outline the documents withheld and the specific grounds for withholding. Such a log would serve as the basis for negotiation between the Committee and the Department about prioritizing the documents for poten-tial production. On January 31, 2012, Chairman Issa wrote to the Attorney General. He said: Should you choose to continue to withhold documents pursuant to the subpoena, you must create a detailed privilege log explain-ing why the Department is refusing to produce each document. If the Department continues to obstruct the congressional in-quiry by not providing documents and infor-mation, this Committee will have no alter-native but to move forward with proceedings to hold you in contempt of Congress. 102 On February 14, 2012, Chairman Issa again wrote to the Attorney General. He said: We cannot wait any longer for the Depart- ment’s cooperation. As such please specify a date by which you expected the Department to produce all documents responsive to the subpoena. In addition, please specify a De-partment representative who will interface with the Committee for production purposes . . . This person’s primary responsibility should be to identify for the Committee all documents the Department has determined to be responsive to the subpoena but is refus-ing to produce, and should provide a privi-lege log of the documents delineating why each one is being withheld from Congress. Please direct this individual to produce this log to the Committee without further delay. 103 On several occasions, Committee staff has asked the Department to provide such a privilege log, including a listing, category- by-category, of documents the Department has located pursuant to the subpoena and the reason the Department will not produce those documents. Despite these requests, however, the Department has neither pro-duced a privilege log nor responded to this aspect of Chairman Issa’s letters of January 31, 2012, and February 14, 2012. The Department has not informed the Committee that it has been unable to locate certain documents. This suggests that the Department is not producing responsive doc-uments in its possession. Since the Depart-ment will not produce a privilege log, it has failed to make a good faith effort to accom-modate the Committee’s legitimate over-sight interests. ASSERTIONS OF NON -COMPLIANCE The Committee’s investigation into Oper- ation Fast and Furious is replete with in-stances in which the Justice Department has openly acknowledged it would not comply with the Committee’s requests. These pro-nouncements began with the March 31, 2011, subpoena to the former Acting ATF Direc-tor, continued through the Committee’s Oc-tober 12, 2011, subpoena to the Attorney Gen-eral, and persist to this day. (a) March 31, 2011, Subpoena On March 16, 2011, Chairman Issa sent a letter to the then-Acting ATF Director re-questing documents about Fast and Furi-ous. 104As part of this request, Chairman Issa asked for a ‘‘list of individuals responsible for authorizing the decision to ‘walk’ guns to Mexico in order to follow them and capture a ‘bigger fish.’’’ 105On the afternoon of March 30, 2011, the deadline given in Chair-man Issa’s letter, Department staff partici-pated in a conference call with Committee staff. During that call, Department staff ex-pressed a lack of understanding over the meaning of the word ‘‘list.’’ 106Department officials further informed Committee staff that the Department would not produce doc-uments by the deadline and were uncertain when they would produce documents in the future. Committee staff understood this re-sponse to mean the Department did not in-tend to cooperate with the Committee’s in-vestigation. The next day Chairman Issa authorized a subpoena for the Acting ATF Director. The following day, the Department wrote to Chairman Issa. Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich wrote: As you know, the Department has been working with the Committee to provide doc-uments responsive to its March 16 request to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Yesterday, we informed Committee staff that we intended to produce a number of responsive documents within the next week. As we explained, there are some documents that we would be unable to provide without compromising the Depart-ment’s ongoing criminal investigation into the death of Agent Brian Terry as well as other investigations and prosecutions, but we would seek to work productively with the Committee to find other ways to be respon-sive to its needs. 107 Despite the Department’s stated intention to produce documents within the next week, it produced no documents for over two months, until June 10, 2011. In the interim, the Department made little effort to work with the Committee to define the scope of the documents required by the subpoena. On April 8, 2011, the Department wrote to Chairman Issa to inform the Committee that it had located documents responsive to the subpoena. Assistant Attorney General Weich wrote that the Department did not plan to share many of these materials with the Com-mittee. His letter stated: To date, our search has located several law enforcement sensitive documents responsive to the requests in your letter and the sub-poena. We have substantial confidentiality interests in these documents because they contain information about ATF strategies and procedures that could be used by individ-uals seeking to evade our law enforcement efforts. We are prepared to make these docu-ments, with some redactions, available for review by Committee staff at the Depart-ment. They will bear redactions to protect VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

In addition, we noti-fied Committee staff that we have identified certain publicly available documents that are responsive. While our efforts to identify responsive documents are continuing, many of your requests seek records relating to on-going criminal investigations. Based upon the Department’s longstanding policy re-garding the confidentiality of ongoing crimi-nal investigations, we are not in a position to disclose such documents, nor can we con-firm or deny the existence of records in our ongoing investigative files. This policy is based on our strong need to protect the inde-pendence and effectiveness of our law en-forcement efforts. 108 The letter cited prior Department policy in support of its position of non-compliance: We are dedicated to holding Agent Terry’s killer or killers responsible through the criminal justice process that is currently un-derway, but we are not in a position to pro-vide additional information at this time re-garding this active criminal investigation for the reasons set forth above. . . . 109 On June 14, 2011, after the Department had produced 194 pages of non-public documents pursuant to the subpoena, the Department informed the Committee that it was delib-erately withholding certain documents: As with previous oversight matters, we have not provided access to documents that contain detailed information about our in-vestigative activities where their disclosure would harm our pending investigations and prosecutions. This includes information that would identify investigative subjects, sen-sitive techniques, anticipated actions, and other details that would assist individuals in evading our law enforcement efforts. Our judgments begin with the premise that we will disclose as much as possible that is re-sponsive to the Committee’s interests, con-sistent with our responsibilities to bring to justice those who are responsible for the death of Agent Terry and those who violate federal firearms laws. 110 The June 14, 2011, letter arrived one day after the Committee held a hearing featuring constitutional experts discussing the legal obligations of the Department to comply with a congressional subpoena. The Depart-ment’s letter did not address the views ex-pressed at the hearing, instead reiterating its internal policy. The letter noted that the Department would not provide access to doc-uments discussing its use of ‘‘sensitive tech-niques’’—even though these techniques were central to the Committee’s investigation. On July 5, 2011, Chairman Issa and Senator Grassley wrote to the Department about se-rious issues involving the lack of informa-tion sharing among Department components, in particular, between the FBI and DEA. 111 These issues raised the possibility that the Department had been deliberately con-cealing information about Fast and Furious from the Committee, including the roles of its component agencies. The next day, the Department responded. It wrote: Your letter raises concerns about the al- leged role of other agencies in matters that you say touch on Operation Fast and Furi- ous. Chairman Issa’s staff previously raised this issue with representatives of the Depart-ment and it is my understanding that discus-sions about whether and how to provide any such sensitive law enforcement information have been ongoing. . . . 112 On July 11, 2011, Chairman Issa and Sen- ator Grassley wrote to the FBI requesting information on the issue of information sharing within the Department. The letter included a request for information relating to the murder of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata. 113On Au- gust 12, 2011, the FBI responded. It wrote: Your letter also asks for specific informa- tion related to the crime scene and events leading to the murder of ICE Agent Jaime Zapata in Mexico on February 15, 2011. As you know, crime scene evidence and the cir-cumstances of a crime are generally not made public in an ongoing investigation. Furthermore, the investigative reports of an ongoing investigation are kept confidential during the investigation to preserve the in-tegrity of the investigation and to ensure its successful conclusion. We regret that we can-not provide more details about the investiga-tion at this time, but we need to ensure all appropriate steps are taken to protect the integrity of the investigation. 114 The FBI did not provide any documents to the Committee regarding the information sharing issues raised, though it did offer to provide a briefing to staff. It delivered that briefing nearly two months later, on October 5, 2011. On October 11, 2011, the Department wrote to Chairman Issa. The Department stated: We believe that we have now substantially concluded our efforts to respond to the Com-mittee requests set forth in the subpoena and the letter of June 8th. 115 The Department was well aware that the Committee was struggling to understand how the Department created its February 4, 2011, letter to Senator Grassley, which the Committee believed to contain false infor-mation. To that end, the Department stated: As we have previously explained to Com- mittee staff, we have also withheld internal communications that were generated in the course of the Department’s effort to respond to congressional and media inquiries about Operation Fast and Furious. These records were created in 2011, well after the comple-tion of the investigative portion of Operation Fast and Furious that the Committee has been reviewing and after the charging deci-sions reflected in the January 25, 2011, in-dictments. Thus, they were not part of the communications regarding the development and implementation of the strategy deci-sions that have been the focus of the Com-mittee’s inquiry. It is longstanding Execu-tive Branch practice not to disclose docu-ments falling into this category because dis-closure would implicate substantial Execu-tive Branch confidentiality interests and separation of powers principles. Disclosure would have a chilling effect on agency offi-cials’ deliberations about how to respond to inquiries from Congress or the media. Such a chill on internal communications would interfere with our ability to respond as effec-tively and efficiently as possible to congres- sional oversight requests. 116 The next day, the Committee issued a sub- poena to Attorney General Holder. (b) October 12, 2011, Subpoena On October 31, 2011, the Department pro- duced its first batch of documents pursuant to the Committee’s October 12, 2011, sub-poena. 117This production consisted of 652 pages. Of these 652 pages, 116 were about the Kingery case, a case that the Department wanted to highlight in an attempt to dis-credit some of the original Fast and Furious whistleblowers. Twenty-eight additional pages were about an operation from the prior administration, the Hernandez case, and 245 pages were about another operation from the prior administration, Operation Wide Re-ceiver. Although the subpoena covered documents from the Hernandez and Wide Receiver cases, their inclusion into the first production batch under the subpoena was indicative of the Department’s strategy in responding to the subpoena. The Department briefed the press on these documents at the same time as it produced them to the Committee. The Department seemed more interested in spin control than in complying with the congres-sional subpoena. Sixty percent of the docu-ments in this first production were related to either Kingery, Hernandez, or Wide Re-ceiver, and therefore, unrelated to the grava-men of the Committee’s investigation into Fast and Furious. On December 2, 2011, shortly before the At- torney General’s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, the Department pro-duced 1,364 pages of documents pertaining to the creation of its February 4, 2011, letter. 118 Despite its statements in the October 11, 2011, letter, the Department, through a letter from Deputy Attorney General James Cole, publicly admitted under pressure its obvious misstatements, formally acknowledging that the February 4, 2011, letter ‘‘contains inac-curacies.’’ 119 On December 13, 2011, on the eve of the Committee’s interview with Gary Grindler, Chief of Staff to the Attorney General, the Department produced 19 pages of responsive documents. 120 On January 5, 2012, the Department pro- duced 482 pages of documents responsive to the subpoena. 121Of these 482 pages, 304 of them, or 63 percent, were related to the Wide Receiver case. This production brought the total number of pages produced pursuant to Wide Receiver to 549, nearly 100 more than the Department had produced at that time regarding Fast and Furious in three docu-ment productions. On January 27, 2012, the Department pro- duced 486 pages of documents pursuant to the October 12, 2011, subpoena. 122In its cover letter, the Department stated, ‘‘[t]he major-ity of materials produced today are respon-sive to items 7, 11 and 12 of your October 11 subpoena.’’ There are no documents in the production, however, responsive to items 7(b) or 11(b)(i–v). The Department wrote in its January 27 cover letter: We are producing or making available for review materials that are responsive to these VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

James Cole to Chairman Darrell Issa (Feb. 1, 2012) [hereinafter Feb. 1 Letter]. 126Letter from Ass’t Att’y Gen.

Holder, Jr., Att’y Gen. of the U.S.). 132Id. 133Transcribed Interview of Gary Grindler, Chief of Staff to the Att’y Gen., at 22 (Dec. 14, 2011) [herein-after Grindler Tr.]. 134Id. 135Transcribed Interview of Jason Weinstein, Dep- uty Ass’t Att’y Gen. at 177 (Jan. 10, 2012). 136Transcribed Interview of Dennis K.

We are not, however, providing materials pertaining to other mat-ters, such as documents regarding ATF cases that do not appear to involve the inappro-priate tactics under review by the Com-mittee; non-ATF cases, except for certain in-formation relating to the death of Customs and Border Protection Agent Brian Terry; administrative matters; and personal records. 123 The Department refused to produce docu- ments pursuant to the subpoena regarding investigations that it had not previously specified to the Committee, or investigations that ‘‘do not appear’’ to involve inappro-priate tactics. In doing so, the Department made itself the sole arbiter of the Commit-tee’s investigative interests, as well as of the use of ‘‘inappropriate’’ tactics. The Depart-ment has prevented Congress from executing its constitutionally mandated oversight function, preferring instead to self-regulate. The October 12, 2011, subpoena, however, covers all investigations in which ATF failed to interdict weapons that had been illegally purchased or transferred—not just those cases previously identified by the Depart-ment. The subpoena does not give the De-partment the authority to define which tac-tics are inappropriate. Rather, the language in sections 4 and 5 of the subpoena schedule is clear. The Department’s refusal to cooper-ate on this front and only produce docu-ments about investigations that it had pre-viously identified—documents that support the Department’s press strategy—is in viola-tion of its obligation to cooperate with con-gressional oversight. On January 31, 2012, Chairman Issa again wrote to the Attorney General, this time asking that the Department produce all doc-uments pursuant to the subpoena by Feb-ruary 9, 2012. 124The following day, the De- partment responded. It stated: Your most recent letter asks that we com- plete the production process under the Octo-ber 11, 2011, subpoena by February 9, 2012. The broad scope of the Committee’s requests and the volume or material to be collected, processed and reviewed in response make it impossible to meet that deadline, despite our good faith efforts. We will continue in good faith to produce materials, but it simply will not be possible to finish the collection, proc-essing and review of materials by the date sought in your most recent letter. 125 Yet, as discussed in Section V.B above, the Department was acutely aware in October 2011, approximately three months earlier, ex-actly what categories of documents the Com-mittee was seeking. In response to the sub-poena, the Department had, up to February 1, 2012, produced more documents relating to a single operation years before Fast and Fu-rious even began than it had relating to Op-eration Fast and Furious itself. On February 16, 2012, the Department pro- duced 304 pages of documents pursuant to the subpoena. 126The production included nearly 60 pages of publicly available and pre-viously produced information, as well as other documents previously produced to the Committee. On February 27, 2012, the Department pro- duced eight pages pursuant to the sub-poena. 127These eight pages, given to the Committee by a whistleblower ten months earlier, were produced only because a tran-scribed interview with a former Associate Deputy Attorney General was to take place the next day. On March 2, 2012, the Department produced 26 pages of documents pursuant to the Octo-ber 12, 2011, subpoena. 128Five of these docu- ments were about the Kingery case. Four-teen documents—over half of the produc-tion—related to Wide Receiver. Seven pages were duplicate copies of a press release al-ready produced to the Committee. On March 16, 2012, the Department pro- duced 357 pages of documents pursuant to the subpoena. Three hundred seven of these pages, or 86 percent, related to the Her-nandez and Medrano cases from the prior Ad-ministration. Twenty other pages had been previously produced by the Department, and seven pages were publicly available on the Justice Department’s website. On April 3, 2012, the Department produced 116 pages of documents pursuant to the sub-poena. Forty four of these pages, or 38 per-cent, related to cases other than Fast and Furious. On April 19, 2012, the Department produced 188 pages of documents pursuant to the subpoena. On May 15, 2012, the Department produced 29 pages of documents pursuant to the sub-poena. Ten of these pages, or 36 percent, re-lated to cases other than Fast and Furious. The Department has produced a total of 6,988 pages to the Committee to date. 129 Though the Department recently stated that it has ‘‘provided documents to the Com-mittee at least twice every month since late last year,’’ the Department has not produced any documents to the Committee in over 30 days. 130 (c) Post-February 4, 2011, Documents Many of the documents the October 12, 2011, subpoena requires were created or pro-duced after February 4, 2011. The Depart-ment first responded to Congress about Fast and Furious on this date. The Department has steadfastly refused to make any docu-ments created after February 4, 2011, avail-able to the Committee. The Department’s actions following the February 4, 2011, letter to Senator Grassley are crucial in determining how it responded to the serious allegations raised by the whis-tleblowers. The October 12, 2011, subpoena covers documents that would help Congress understand what the Department knew about Fast and Furious, including when and how it discovered its February 4 letter was false, and the Department’s efforts to con-ceal that information from Congress and the public. Such documents would include those relating to actions the Department took to silence or retaliate against Fast and Furious whistleblowers and to find out what had hap-pened, and how the Department assessed the culpability of those involved in the program. The Attorney General first expressed the Department’s position regarding documents created after February 4, 2011, in his testi-mony before the House Judiciary Committee on December 8, 2011. In no uncertain terms, he stated: [W]ith regard to the Justice Department as a whole—and I’m certainly a member of the Justice Department—we will not provide memos after February the 4th . . . e-mails, memos—consistent with the way in which the Department of Justice has always con- ducted itself in its interactions. 131 He again impressed this point upon Com- mittee Members later in the hearing: Well, with the regard to provision of e- mails, I thought I’ve made it clear that after February the 4th it is not our intention to provide e-mail information consistent with the way in which the Justice Department has always conducted itself. 132 The Department reiterated this position less than a week later in a December 14, 2011, transcribed interview of Gary Grindler, the Attorney General’s Chief of Staff. Depart-ment counsel broadened the Department’s position with respect to sharing documents created after February 4, 2011, in refusing to allow Grindler to answer any questions re-lating to conversations that he had with anyone in the Department regarding Fast and Furious after February 4, 2011. Grindler stated: What I am saying is that the Attorney General made it clear at his testimony last week that we are not providing information to the committee subsequent to the Feb-ruary 4th letter. 133 Department counsel expanded the position the Attorney General articulated regarding documentary evidence at the House Judici-ary Committee hearing to include testi-monial evidence as well. 134Given the initial response by the Department to the congres-sional inquiry into Fast and Furious, the comments by Department counsel created a barrier preventing Congress from obtaining vital information about Fast and Furious. The Department has maintained this posi- tion during additional transcribed inter-views. In an interview with Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein on Janu-ary 10, 2012, Department counsel prohibited him from responding to an entire line of questioning about his interactions with the Arizona U.S. Attorney’s Office because it ‘‘implicates the post-February 4th pe-riod.’’ 135 Understanding the post-February 4th pe- riod is critical to the Committee’s investiga-tion. Furthermore, documents from this pe-riod are responsive to the October 12, 2011, subpoena. For example, following the Feb-ruary 4, 2011, letter, Jason Weinstein, at the behest of Assistant Attorney General Breuer, prepared an analytical review of Fast and Furious. 136Weinstein interviewed Emory Hurley and Patrick Cunningham of the Ari-zona U.S. Attorney’s office as part of this re-view. 137The document that resulted from Weinstein’s analysis specifically discussed issues relevant to the Committee’s inquiry. To date, the Department has not produced documents related to Weinstein’s review to the Committee. Chairman Issa has sent several letters urg- ing the Department to produce documents pertaining to the Fast and Furious from the post-indictment period, and raising the pos-sibility of contempt if the Attorney General chose not to comply. Initially, the Depart-ment refused to produce any documents cre-ated after January 25, 2011, the date that the VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4187 June 28, 2012 138Letter from Chairman Darrell Issa to Ass’t Att’y Gen. Ronald Weich (Nov. 9, 2011). 139See, e.g., Grindler Tr. at 22. 140Jan. 31 Letter, supra note 102. 141Feb. 1 Letter, supra note 125. 142Id. 143Feb. 14 Letter, supra note 103. 144Id (emphasis in original). 145Feb. 16 Letter, supra note 126. case was unsealed. On November 9, 2011, Chairman Issa wrote to the Department: Over the past six months, Senator Grassley and I have asked for this information on many occasions, and each time we have been told it would not be produced. This informa-tion is covered by the subpoena served on the Attorney General on October 12, 2011, and I expect it to be produced no later than Wednesday, November 16, at 5:00 p.m. Failure to comply with this request will leave me with no other alternative than the use of compulsory process to obtain your testi-mony under oath. * * * * * * * Understanding the Department’s actions after Congress started asking questions about Fast and Furious is crucial. As you know, substantial effort was expended to hide the actions of the Department from Congress . . . I expect nothing less than full compliance with all aspects of the subpoena, including complete production of documents created after the indictments were unsealed on January 25, 2011. 138 On December 2, 2011, the Department pro- duced documents pertaining to its February 4, 2011, response to Senator Grassley. When the Attorney General testified before Con-gress on December 8, 2011, he created a new cutoff date of February 4, 2011, after which no documents would be produced to Con-gress, despite the fact that such documents were covered by the October 12, 2011, sub-poena. In support of this position regarding post-February 4, 2011, documents, in tran-scribed interviews, Department representa-tives have asserted a ‘‘separation of powers’’ privilege without further explanation or ci-tation to legal authority. 139The Department has not cited any legal authority to support this new, extremely broad assertion of privi-lege. On January 31, 2012, Chairman Issa wrote to the Attorney General about this new, ar-bitrary date created by the Department, and raised the possibility of contempt: In short, the Committee requires full com- pliance with all aspects of the subpoena, in-cluding complete production of documents created after the Department’s February 4, 2011, letter .... I f the Department continues to obstruct the congressional inquiry by not providing documents and information, this Committee will have no alternative but to move forward with proceedings to hold you in contempt of Congress. 140 The Department responded the following day. It said: To the extent responsive materials exist that post-date congressional review of this matter and were not generated in that con-text or to respond to media inquiries, and likewise do not implicate other recognized Department interests in confidentiality (for example, matters occurring before a grand jury, investigative activities under seal or the disclosure of which is prohibited by law, core investigative information, or matters reflecting internal Department delibera-tions), we intend to provide them. 141 The Department quoted from its October 11, 2011, letter, stating: [A]s we have previously explained to Com- mittee staff, we have also withheld internal communications that were generated in the course of the Department’s effort to respond to congressional and media inquiries about Operation Fast and Furious. These records were created in 2011, well after the comple-tion of the investigative portion of Operation Fast and Furious that the Committee has been reviewing and after the charging deci-sions reflected in the January 25, 2011, in-dictments. Thus, they were not part of the communications regarding the development and implementation of the strategy deci-sions that have been the focus of the Com-mittee’s inquiry. It is longstanding Execu-tive Branch practice not to disclose docu-ments falling into this category because dis-closure would implicate substantial Execu-tive Branch confidentiality interests and separation of powers principles. Disclosure would have a chilling effect on agency offi-cials’ deliberations about how to respond to inquiries from Congress or the media. Such a chill on internal communications would interfere with our ability to respond as effec-tively and efficiently as possible to congres-sional oversight requests. 142 On February 14, 2012, Chairman Issa again wrote to the Department regarding post-Feb- ruary 4, 2011, documents, and again raised the possibility of contempt: Complying with the Committee’s subpoena is not optional. Indeed, the failure to produce documents pursuant to a congres-sional subpoena is a violation of federal law. The Department’s letter suggests that its failure to produce, among other things, ‘‘de-liberative documents and other internal communications generated in response to congressional oversight requests’’ is based on the premise that ‘‘disclosure would com-promise substantial separation of powers principles and Executive Branch confiden-tiality interests.’’ Your February 4, 2011, cut- off date of providing documents to the Com-mittee is entirely arbitrary, and comes from a ‘‘separation of powers’’ privilege that does not actually exist. You cite no legal authority to support your new, extremely broad assertion. To the con-trary, as you know, Congress possesses the ‘‘power of inquiry.’’ Furthermore, ‘‘the issuance of a subpoena pursuant to an au-thorized investigation is . . . an indispen-sable ingredient of lawmaking.’’ Because the Department has not cited any legal author-ity as the basis for withholding documents, or provided the Committee with a privilege log with respect to documents withheld, its efforts to accommodate the Committee’s constitutional obligation to conduct over-sight of the Executive Branch are incom-plete. 143 * * * * * * * Please specify a date by which you expect the Department to produce all documents re- sponsive to the subpoena. In addition, please specify a Department representative who will interface with the Committee for pro-duction purposes. This individual should also serve as the conduit for dealing with possible contempt proceedings, should the Depart-ment continue to ignore the Committee’s subpoena. 144 On February 16, 2012, the Department re- sponded. The response did not address the post-February 4, 2011, documents, nor did it address the possibility of contempt. The De-partment’s letter stated: We have produced documents to the Com- mittee on a rolling basis; since late last year these productions have occurred approxi-mately twice a month. It is our intent to ad-here to this rolling production schedule until we have completed the process of producing all responsive documents to which the Com-mittee is entitled, consistent with the long-standing policies of the Executive Branch across administrations of both parties. More-over, we intend to send a letter soon memo-rializing our discussions with your staff about the status of our production of docu-ments within the various categories of the subpoena. Our efforts to cooperate with the Com- mittee have been a significant undertaking, involving a great deal of hard work by a large number of Department employees. The Department has been committed to pro-viding the documents and information nec-essary to allow the Committee to satisfy its core oversight interests regarding the use of inappropriate tactics in Fast and Furious. The Department, however, has yet to produce any documents pursuant to the sub-poena created after February 4, 2011. Despite warnings by Chairman Issa that the Com-mittee would initiate contempt if the De-partment failed to comply with the sub- poena, the Department has refused to produce documents. (d) Interview Requests In addition to the October 12, 2011, sub- poena, the Committee has requested to inter-view key individuals in Operation Fast and Furious and related programs. The Com-mittee accommodated the Department’s re-quest to delay an interview with Hope MacAllister, the lead case agent for Oper-ation Fast and Furious, despite her vast knowledge of the program. The Committee agreed to this accommodation due to the De-partment’s expressed concern about inter-viewing a key witness prior to trial. Throughout the investigation, the Depart- ment has had an evolving policy with regard to witnesses that excluded ever-broader cat-egories of witnesses from participating in volunteer interviews. The Department first refused to allow line attorneys to testify in transcribed interviews, and then it prevented first-line supervisors from testifying. Next, the Department refused to make Senate-con-firmed Department officials available for transcribed interviews. One such Senate-con-firmed official, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, is a central focus in the Com-mittee’s investigation. On February 16, 2012, the Department retreated somewhat from its position, noting in a letter to the Committee that it was ‘‘prepared to work with [the Committee] to find a mutually agreeable date for [Breuer] to appear and answer the Committee’s questions, whether or not that appearance is public.’’ 145The Department has urged the Committee to reconsider this interview request. While the Department has facilitated a dozen interviews to avoid compulsory deposi-tions, there have been several instances in which the Department has refused to cooper-ate with the Committee in scheduling inter-views. The Department has stated that it would not make available certain individuals that the Committee has requested to inter-view. On December 6, 2011, the Department wrote: We would like to defer any final decisions about the Committee’s request for Mr. Swartz’s interview until we have identified any responsive documents, some of which may implicate equities of another agency. The remaining employees you have asked to interview are all career employees who are either line prosecutors or first- or second- level supervisors.

The remaining three employees you have asked to interview— Emory Hurley, Serra Tsethlikai, and Joseph Cooley—are line prosecutors. We are not pre-pared to make any of these attorneys avail-able for interviews. 146 The Department did, however, make Pat- rick Cunningham, Chief of the Criminal Di-vision for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Ari-zona, available for an interview. The Com-mittee had been requesting to interview Cunningham since summer 2011. The Depart-ment finally allowed access to Cunningham for an interview in December 2011. Cunningham chose to retain private counsel instead of Department counsel. On January 17, 2012, Cunningham canceled his interview scheduled for the Committee on January 19, 2012. Chairman Issa issued a subpoena to Cunningham to appear for a deposition on January 24, 2012. In a letter dated January 19, 2012, Cunningham’s counsel informed the Committee that Cunningham would ‘‘assert his constitutional privilege not to be com-pelled to be a witness against himself.’’ 147On January 24, 2012, Chairman Issa wrote to the Attorney General to express that the ab-sence of Cunningham’s testimony would make it ‘‘difficult to gauge the veracity of some of the Department’s claims’’ regarding Fast and Furious. 148 On January 27, 2012, Cunningham left the Department of Justice. After months of Committee requests, the Department finally made him available for an interview just be-fore he left the Department. The actions of the Department in delaying the interview and Cunningham’s own assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege delayed and denied the Committee the benefit of his testimony. FAILURE TO TURN OVER DOCUMENTS The Department has failed to turn over any documents pertaining to three main cat-egories contained in the October 12, 2011, subpoena. (a) Who at Justice Department Headquarters Should Have Known of the Reckless Tactics The Committee is seeking documents re- lating to who had access to information about the objectionable tactics used in Oper-ation Fast and Furious, who approved the use of these tactics, and what information was available to those individuals when they approved the tactics. Documents that whis-tleblowers have provided to the Committee indicate that those officials were the senior officials in the Criminal Division, including Lanny Breuer and one of his top deputies, Jason Weinstein. Documents in this category include those relating to the preparation of the wiretap ap-plications, as well as certain ATF, DEA, and FBI Reports of Investigation. Key decision makers at Justice Department headquarters relied on these and other documents to ap-prove the investigation. (b) How the Department Concluded that Fast and Furious was ‘‘Fundamentally Flawed’’ The Committee requires documents from the Department relating to how officials learned about whistleblower allegations and what actions they took as a result. The Com-mittee is investigating not just management of Operation Fast and Furious, but also the Department’s efforts to slow and otherwise interfere with the Committee’s investiga-tion. For months after the congressional inquiry began, the Department refused to acknowl-edge that anything improper occurred during Fast and Furious. At a May 5, 2011, meeting with Committee staff, a Department rep-resentative first acknowledged that ‘‘there’s a there, there.’’ The Attorney General ac-knowledged publicly that Fast and Furious was ‘‘fundamentally flawed’’ on October 7, 2011. On December 2, 2011, the Department fi-nally admitted that its February 4, 2011, let-ter to Senator Grassley contained false in-formation—something Congress had been telling the Department for over seven months. Documents in this category include those that explain how the Department responded to the crisis in the wake of the death of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. These doc-uments will reveal when the Department re-alized it had a problem, and what actions it took to resolve that problem. These docu-ments will also show whether senior Depart-ment officials were surprised to learn that gunwalking occurred during Fast and Furi-ous, or if they already knew that to be the case. These documents will also identify who at the Department was responsible for au-thorizing retaliation against the whistle-blowers. The documents may also show the Department’s assignment of responsibility to officials who knew about the reckless con-duct or were negligent during Fast and Furi-ous. (c) How the Inter-Agency Task Force Failed The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program was created to coordinate inter-agency information shar-ing. As early as December 2009, the DEA shared information with ATF that should have led to arrests and the identification of the gun trafficking network that Fast and Furious sought to uncover. The Committee has received information suggesting that, after arrests were made one year later, ATF discovered that two Mexican drug cartel as-sociates at the top of the Fast and Furious network had been designated as national se-curity assets by the FBI, and at times have been paid FBI informants. Because of this cooperation, these associates are considered by some to be unindictable. Documents in this category will reveal the extent of the lack of information-sharing among DEA, FBI, and ATF. Although the Deputy Attorney General is aware of this problem, he has expressed little interest in resolving it. VI. ADDITIONAL ACCOMMODATIONS BY THE COMMITTEE As discussed above in Section V.C.5, the Department has failed to turn over any docu-ments responsive to three main categories covered by the October 12, 2011, subpoena: (a) Who at Justice Department Head- quarters Should Have Known of the Reckless Tactics; (b) How the Department Concluded that Fast and Furious was ‘‘Fundamentally Flawed’’; and, (c) How the Inter-Agency Task Force Failed. The Committee notified the Justice De- partment on multiple occasions that its fail-ure to produce any documents responsive to these three categories would force the Com-mittee to begin contempt proceedings against the Attorney General. On May 18, 2012, Chairman Issa, along with Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, wrote a letter to the Attorney General. As an accommodation to the Department, the letter offered to narrow the scope of docu-ments the Department needed to provide in order to avoid contempt proceedings. 149Doc- uments in category (c) are outside the scope of the narrowed request, and so the Depart-ment no longer needed to produce them to avoid contempt proceedings, even though such documents are covered by the October 12, 2011, subpoena. The Committee also obtained copies of wiretap applications authorized by senior Department officials during Operation Fast and Furious. These documents, given to the Committee by whistleblowers, shined light on category (a). Still, many subpoenaed doc-uments under this category have been delib-erately withheld by the Department. These documents are critical to understanding who is responsible for failing to promptly stop Fast and Furious. The Department has cited such documents as ‘‘core investigative’’ ma-terials that pertain to ‘‘pending law enforce-ment matters.’’ 150To accommodate the De- partment’s interest in successfully pros-ecuting criminal defendants in this case, the Committee is willing to accept production of these documents after the current prosecu-tions of the 20 straw purchasers indicted in January 2011, have concluded at the trial level. This deferment should in no way be in-terpreted as the Committee ceding its legiti-mate right to receive these documents, but instead solely as an accommodation meant to alleviate the Department’s concerns about preserving the integrity of the ongoing pros-ecutions. In addition to deferring production of cat- egory (a) documents, the Committee is also willing to view these documents in camera with limited redactions. These accommoda-tions represent a significant commitment on the part of the Committee to negotiating in good faith to avoid contempt. Unlike documents in category (a), the De- partment has no legitimate interest in lim-iting the Committee’s access to documents in category (b). On February 4, 2011, the De-partment wrote a letter to Congress cat-egorically denying that gunwalking had oc-curred. This letter was false. Still, it was not withdrawn until December 2011. The Com-mittee has a right to know how the Depart-ment learned that gunwalking did in fact occur, and how it handled the fallout inter- nally. The deliberative process privilege is not recognized by Congress as a matter of law and precedent. By sending a letter that contained false and misleading statements, the Department forfeited any reasonable ex-pectation that the Committee would accom-modate its interest in withholding delibera-tive process documents. On June 20, 2012, minutes before the start of the Committee’s meeting to consider a resolution holding the Attorney General in contempt, the Committee received a letter from Deputy Attorney General James Cole claiming that the President asserted execu-tive privilege over certain documents cov-ered by the subpoena. The Committee has a number of concerns about the validity of this assertion: The assertion was transparently not a valid claim of privilege given its last minute nature; The assertion was obstructive given that it could have and should have been asserted months ago, but was not until literally the day of the contempt mark-up; The assertion is eight months late. It should have been made by October 25, 2011, the subpoena return date; To this moment, the President himself has not indicated that he is asserting execu-tive privilege; The assertion is transparently invalid in that it is not credible that every document VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

The Committee has spent 16 months investigating, talking to dozens of individuals, and collecting docu-ments from many sources. The remaining documents are ones uniquely in the posses-sion of the Justice Department; and, Without these documents, the Commit- tee’s important legislative work will con-tinue to be stymied. The documents are nec-essary to evaluate what government reform is necessary within the Justice Department to avoid the problems uncovered by the in-vestigation in the future. The President has now asserted executive privilege. This assertion, however, does not change the fact that Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. is in contempt of Congress today for failing to turn over lawfully subpoenaed documents explaining the Department’s role in withdrawing the false letter it sent to Congress. VII. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES ON CONTEMPT Contempt proceedings in Congress date back over 215 years. These proceedings pro-vide Congress a valuable mechanism for ad-judicating its interests. Congressional his-tory is replete with examples of the pursuit of contempt proceedings by House commit-tees when faced with strident resistance to their constitutional authority to exercise in-vestigative power. A. P ASTINSTANCES OF CONTEMPT Congress first exercised its contempt au- thority in 1795 when three Members of the House charged two businessmen, Robert Randall and Charles Whitney, with offering bribes in exchange for the passage of legisla-tion granting Randall and his business part-ners several million acres bordering Lake Erie. 152This first contempt proceeding began with a resolution by the House deeming the allegations were adequate ‘‘evidence of an attempt to corrupt,’’ and the House reported a corresponding resolution that was referred to a special committee. 153The special com- mittee reported a resolution recommending formal proceedings against Randall and Whitney ‘‘at the bar of the House.’’ 154 The House adopted the committee resolu- tion which laid out the procedure for the contempt proceeding. Interrogatories were exchanged, testimony was received, Randall and Whitney were provided counsel, and at the conclusion, on January 4, 1796, the House voted 78–17 to adopt a resolution finding Randall guilty of contempt. 155As punish-ment Randall was ‘‘ordered [ ] to be brought to the bar, reprimanded by the Speaker, and held in custody until further resolution of the House.’’ 156Randall was detained until January 13, 1796, when the House passed a resolution discharging him. 157In contrast, Whitney ‘‘was absolved of any wrongdoing,’’ since his actions were against a ‘‘member- elect’’ and occurred ‘‘away from the seat of government.’’ 158 Congressional records do not demonstrate any question or hesitation regarding wheth-er Congress possesses the power to hold indi-viduals in contempt. 159Moreover, there was no question that Congress could punish a non-Member for contempt. 160Since the first contempt proceeding, numerous congres-sional committees have pursued contempt against obstinate administration officials as well as private citizens who failed to cooper-ate with congressional investigations. 161 Since the first proceeding against Randall and Whitney, House committees, whether standing or select, have served as the vehicle used to lay the foundation for contempt pro-ceedings in the House. 162 On August 3, 1983, the House passed a privi- leged resolution citing Environmental Pro-tection Agency Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford with contempt of Congress for fail-ing to produce documents to a House sub-committee pursuant to a subpoena. 163This was the first occasion the House cited a cabi-net-level executive branch member for con-tempt of Congress. 164A subsequent agree- ment between the House and the Adminis-trator, as well as prosecutorial discretion, was the base for not enforcing the contempt citation against Burford. 165 Within the past fifteen years the Com- mittee on Oversight and Government Reform has undertaken or prepared for contempt proceedings on multiple occasions. In 1998, Chairman Dan Burton held a vote recom-mending contempt for Attorney General Janet Reno based on her failure to comply with a subpoena issued in connection with the Committee’s investigation into cam-paign finance law violations. 166On August 7, 1998, the Committee held Attorney General Reno in contempt by a vote of 24 to 18. 167 During the 110th Congress, Chairman Henry Waxman threatened and scheduled contempt proceedings against several Ad-ministration officials. 168Contempt reports were drafted against Attorney General Mi-chael B. Mukasey, Stephen L. Johnson, Ad-ministrator of the U.S. Environmental Pro-tection Agency, and Susan E. Dudley, Ad-ministrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the White House Office of Management and Budget. Business meetings to consider these drafts were scheduled. 169Former Attorney General Mukasey’s draft contempt report charged him with failing to produce documents in connection to the Committee’s investigation of the release of classified information. Ac-cording to their draft contempt reports, Ad-ministrators Johnson and Dudley failed to cooperate with the Committee’s lengthy in-vestigation into California’s petition for a waiver to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles and the revision of the national ambient air quality standards for ozone. Most recently, the House Judiciary Com- mittee pursued contempt against former White House Counsel Harriet Miers and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten. 170 On June 13, 2007, the Committee served sub-poenas on Miers and Bolten. 171After at- tempts at accommodations from both sides, the Committee determined that Miers and Bolten did not satisfactorily comply with the subpoenas. On July 25, 2007, the Com-mittee voted, 22–17, to hold Miers and Bolten in contempt of Congress. On February 14, 2008, the full House, with most Republicans abstaining, voted to hold Miers and Bolten in criminal contempt of Congress by a margin of 223–42. 172One hun- dred seventy-three Members of Congress did not cast a vote either in favor or against the resolution. 173All but nine Members who ab- stained were Republican.174Only three Re- publicans supported the contempt resolution for Miers and Bolten. 175This marked the first contempt vote by Congress with respect to the Executive Branch since the Reagan Administration. 176The resolutions passed by the House allowed Congress to exercise all available remedies in the pursuit of con-tempt. 177The House Judiciary Committee’s action against Miers marked the first time that a former administration official had ever been held in contempt. 178 B. D OCUMENT PRODUCTIONS The Department has refused to produce thousands of documents pursuant to the Oc-tober 12, 2011, subpoena because it claims certain documents are Law Enforcement Sensitive, others pertain to ongoing criminal investigations, and others relate to internal deliberative process. During the past ten years, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has undertaken a number of investigations that resulted in strong opposition from the Exec-utive Branch regarding document produc-tions. These investigations include regu-latory decisions of the Environmental Pro-tection Agency (EPA), the leak of CIA opera-tive Valerie Plame’s identity, and the frat-ricide of Army Corporal Patrick Tillman. In all cases during the 110th Congress, the Ad-ministration produced an overwhelming amount of documents, sheltering a narrow few by asserting executive privilege. In 2008, the Committee received or re- viewed in camera all agency-level documents related to the EPA’s decision regarding Cali-fornia’s request for a rule waiver, numbering approximately 27,000 pages in total. 179Ac- cording to a Committee Report, the EPA VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

Ronald Weich to Chairman Darrell Issa (May 15, 2012). withheld only 32 documents related to the California waiver decision based on execu-tive privilege. These included notes of tele-phone calls or meetings in the White House ‘‘involving at least one high-ranking EPA of-ficial and at least one high-ranking White House official.’’ 180The White House Counsel informed the Committee that these docu-ments represented ‘‘deliberations at the very highest level of government.’’ 181 During the Committee’s 2008 investigation into the Administration’s promulgation of ozone standards, the EPA produced or al-lowed in camera review of over 35,000 pages of documents. The President asserted executive privilege over a narrow set of documents, en-compassing approximately 35 pages. One such document included ‘‘talking points for the EPA Administrator to use in a meeting with [the President].’’ 182 In furtherance of the Committee’s ozone regulation investigation, OIRA produced or allowed in camera review of 7,500 docu- ments. 183Documents produced by EPA and OIRA represented pre-decisional opinions of career scientists and agency counsel. 184 These documents were sensitive because some, if not all, related to ongoing litiga-tion. 185The OIRA Administrator withheld a certain number of documents that were com-munications between OIRA and certain White House officials, and the President ulti-mately ‘‘claimed executive privilege over these documents.’’ 186 Also during the 110th Congress, the Com- mittee investigated the revelation of CIA op-erative Valerie Plame’s identity in the news media. The Committee’s investigation was contemporaneous with the Department of Justice’s criminal investigation into the leak of this classified information—a situa-tion nearly identical to the Committee’s cur-rent investigation into Operation Fast and Furious. Pursuant to the Committee’s investiga- tion, the Justice Department produced FBI reports of witness interviews, commonly re-ferred to as ‘‘302s.’’ Specifically, documents reviewed by the Committee staff during the Valerie Plame investigation included the fol-lowing: FBI interviews of federal officials who did not work in the White House, as well as interviews of relevant private individuals . . . total of 224 pages of records of FBI inter-view reports with 31 individuals, including materials related to a former Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Undersecretary [sic], and two Assistant Secretaries of State, and other former or current CIA and State Department officials, including the Vice President’s CIA briefer. 187 To accommodate the Committee, the De- partment permitted in camera review of the following: [D]ocuments include[ing] redacted reports of the FBI interview with Mr. Libby, Andrew Card, Karl Rove, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley, Dan Bartlett, and Scott McClellan and another 104 pages of additional interview reports of the Director of Central Intel-ligence, and eight other White House or Of- fice of the Vice President officials. 188 The only documents the Justice Depart- ment declined to produce were the FBI 302s with respect to the interviews of the Presi-dent and the Vice President. 189Ultimately, the Committee relented in its pursuit of the President’s 302. 190The Committee, however, persisted in its request for the Vice Presi-dent’s 302. As a result, the President asserted executive privilege over that particular doc-ument. 191 The Committee specifically included 302s in its October 12, 2011, subpoena to the Attor-ney General regarding Fast and Furious. These subpoenaed 302s do not include FBI interviews with White House personnel, or even any other Executive Branch employee. Still, in spite of past precedent, the Depart-ment has refused to produce those docu-ments to the Committee or to allow staff an in camera review. In the 110th Congress, the Committee in- vestigated the fratricide of Army Corporal Patrick Tillman and the veracity of the ac-count of the capture and rescue of Army Pri-vate Jessica Lynch. 192The Committee em- ployed a multitude of investigative tools, in-cluding hearings, transcribed interviews, and non-transcribed interviews. The Administra-tion produced thousands of documents. 193 The Committee requested the following: [T]he White House produce all documents received or generated by any official in the Executive Office of the President from April 22 until July 1, 2004, that related to Corporal Tillman. The Committee reviewed approxi-mately 1,500 pages produced in response to this request. The documents produced to the Committee included e-mail communications between senior White House officials holding the title of ‘‘Assistant to the President.’’ Ac-cording to the White House, the White House withheld from the Committee only prelimi-nary drafts of the speech President Bush de-livered at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner on May 1, 2004. 194 The Department of Defense produced over 31,000 responsive documents, and the Com-mittee received an unprecedented level of ac-cess to documents and personnel. 195 The Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s investigations over the past five years demonstrate ample precedent for the production of a wide array of documents from the Executive Branch. In these inves-tigations, the Committee received pre- decisional deliberative regulatory docu-ments, documents pertaining to ongoing in-vestigations, and communications between and among senior advisors to the President. The Committee’s October 12, 2011, subpoena calls for many of these same materials, in-cluding 302s and deliberative documents. Still, the Justice Department refuses to comply. Further, the number of documents the De- partment has produced during the Commit-tee’s Fast and Furious investigation pales in comparison to those produced in conjunction with the Committee’s prior investigations. In separate EPA investigations, the Com-mittee received 27,000 documents and 35,000 documents respectively. In the Patrick Till- man investigation, the Committee received 31,000 documents. Moreover, in the Valerie Plame investigation, the Committee re-ceived access to highly sensitive materials despite the fact that the Justice Department was conducting a parallel criminal investiga-tion. As of May 15, 2012, in the Fast and Furious investigation, in the light most favorable to the Department of Justice, it has ‘‘provided the Committee over 7,600 pages of docu-ments’’—a small fraction of what has been produced to the Committee in prior inves-tigations and of what the Department has produced to the Inspector General in this matter. 196This small number reflects the De- partment’s lack of cooperation since the Committee sent its first letter to the Depart-ment about Fast and Furious on March 16, 2011. VIII. RULES REQUIREMENTS E XPLANATION OF AMENDMENTS Mr. Gowdy offered an amendment that up- dated the Committee’s Report to reflect that the President asserted the executive privi-lege over certain documents subpoenaed by the Committee. The amendment also up-dated the Report to include the Committee’s concerns about the validity of the Presi-dent’s assertion of the executive privilege. The amendment was agreed to by a recorded vote. C OMMITTEE CONSIDERATION On June 20, 2012, the Committee on Over- sight and Government Reform met in open session with a quorum present to consider a report of contempt against Eric H. Holder, Jr., the Attorney General of the United States, for failure to comply with a Congres-sional subpoena. The Committee approved the Report by a roll call vote of 23–17 and or-dered the Report reported favorably to the House. R OLLCALLVOTES The following recorded votes were taken during consideration of the contempt Re-port: Mr. Welch offered an amendment to add language to the Executive Summary stating that contempt proceedings at this time are unwarranted because the Committee has not met with former Attorney General Michael Mukasey. The amendment was defeated by a recorded vote of 14 Yeas to 23 Nays.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4303 June 28, 2012 MINORITY VIEWS Report of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Resolution Recommending that the House of Representatives Find Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General, U.S. Department of Jus-tice, in Contempt of Congress for Refusal to Comply with a Subpoena Duly Issued by the Committee on Oversight and Govern-ment Reform On June 20, 2012, the Committee adopted on a strictly party-line vote a report and res-olution (hereinafter ‘‘Contempt Citation’’) concluding that Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr., the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, should be held in con-tempt of Congress for declining to produce certain documents pursuant to the Commit-tee’s investigation of ‘‘gunwalking’’ during Operation Fast and Furious and previous op-erations. Committee Democrats were unanimous in their opposition to the Contempt Citation. These dissenting views conclude that Con-gress has a Constitutional responsibility to conduct vigorous oversight of the executive branch, but that holding the Attorney Gen-eral in contempt would be an extreme, un-precedented action based on partisan elec-tion-year politics rather than the facts un-covered during the investigation. These views find that the Committee failed to honor its Constitutional responsibility to avoid unnecessary conflict with the execu-tive branch by seeking reasonable accom-modations when possible. The Committee flatly rejected a fair and reasonable offer made by the Attorney General to provide ad-ditional internal deliberative documents sought by the Committee in exchange for a good faith commitment toward resolving the contempt dispute. Instead, the Committee has repeatedly shifted the goalposts in this investigation after failing to find evidence to support its unsubstantiated allegations. The Contempt Citation adopted by the Committee contains serious and significant errors, omissions, and misrepresentations. To address these inaccuracies, these views hereby incorporate and attach the 95-page staff report issued by Ranking Member Eli-jah Cummings in January 2012, which pro-vides a comprehensive analysis of the evi-dence obtained during the Committee’s in-vestigation. I. T HECOMMITTEE ’SACTIONS HAVEBEEN HIGHLY PARTISAN The Committee’s contempt vote on June 20, 2012, was the culmination of one of the most highly politicized congressional inves-tigations in decades. It was based on numer-ous unsubstantiated allegations that tar-geted the Obama Administration for polit-ical purposes, and it ignored documented evi-dence of gunwalking operations during the previous administration. During the Committee’s 16-month inves- tigation, the Committee refused all Demo-cratic requests for witnesses and hearings. In one of the most significant flaws of the in-vestigation, the Chairman refused multiple requests to hold a public hearing with Ken-neth Melson, the former head of ATF, the agency responsible for conducting these op-erations. 1The Chairman’s refusal came after Mr. Melson told Committee investigators privately in July 2011 that he never informed senior officials at the Justice Department about gunwalking during Operation Fast and Furious because he was unaware of it him-self. 2Mr. Melson’s statements directly con- tradict the claim in the Contempt Citation that senior Justice Department officials were aware of gunwalking because Mr. Melson briefed Gary Grindler, then-Acting Deputy Attorney General, in March 2010. 3 Despite promising that he would be ‘‘inves- tigating a president of my own party because many of the issues we’re working on began on [sic] President Bush,’’ the Chairman also refused multiple requests for former Attor-ney General Michael Mukasey to testify be-fore the Committee or to meet with Com-mittee Members informally to discuss the origination and evolution of gunwalking op-erations since 2006. 4Documents obtained during the investigation indicate that Mr. Mukasey was briefed personally on botched efforts to coordinate firearm interdictions with Mexican law enforcement officials in 2007 and was informed directly that such ef-forts would be expanded during his tenure. 5 The Committee also failed to conduct interviews of other key figures. For example, the Committee did not respond to a request to interview Alice Fisher, who served as As-sistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division from 2005 to 2008, about her role in authorizing wiretaps in Operation Wide Receiver, or to a request to interview Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Blanco, who also authorized wiretaps in Op-eration Fast and Furious and still works at the Department, but who was placed in his position under the Bush Administration in April 2008. 6No explanation for these refusals has been given. During the Committee business meeting on June 20, 2012, every Democratic amendment to correct the Contempt Citation by noting these facts was defeated on strictly party- line votes. II. H OLDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN CONTEMPT WOULD BEUNPRECEDENTED The House of Representatives has never in its history held an Attorney General in con-tempt of Congress. The only precedent ref-erenced in the Contempt Citation for holding a sitting Attorney General in contempt for refusing to provide documents is this Com-mittee’s vote in 1998 to hold then-Attorney General Janet Reno in contempt during the campaign finance investigation conducted by then-Chairman Dan Burton. 7 Chairman Burton’s investigation was wide- ly discredited, and the decision to hold the Attorney General in contempt was criticized by editorial boards across the country as ‘‘a gross abuse of his powers as chairman of the committee,’’ 8a ‘‘fishing expedition,’’9 ‘‘laced with palpable political motives,’’10 and ‘‘showboating.’’11That action was so partisan and so widely discredited that Newt Gingrich, who was then Speaker, did not bring it to the House Floor for a vote. 12 Similarly, numerous commentators and editorial boards have criticized Chairman Issa’s recent actions as ‘‘a monstrous witch hunt,’’ 13‘‘a pointless partisan fight,’’14and ‘‘dysfunctional Washington as usual.’’15 III. T HECOMMITTEE HASHELD THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO AN IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD For more than a year, the Committee has held the Attorney General to an impossible standard by demanding documents he is pro-hibited by law from producing. One of the key sets of documents de- manded during this investigation has been federal wiretap applications submitted by law enforcement agents in order to obtain a federal court’s approval to secretly monitor the telephone calls of individuals suspected of gun trafficking. The federal wiretapping statute, which was passed by Congress and signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson on June 19, 1968, provides for a penalty of up to five years in prison for the unauthorized disclosure of wiretap com-munications and prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of wiretap applications approved by federal judges, who must seal them to protect against their disclosure. 16The stat- ute states: Each application for an order authorizing or approving the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication under this chapter shall be made in writing upon oath or affirmation to a judge of competent juris-diction. Applications made and orders grant-ed under this chapter shall be sealed by the judge. 17 Similarly, in 1940, Congress passed a stat- ute giving the Supreme Court the power to prescribe rules of pleading, practice, and pro-cedure in criminal cases. 18In 1946, the mod- ern grand jury secrecy rule was codified as Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides for criminal pen-alties for disclosing grand jury informa-tion. 19 The Department has explained this to the Committee repeatedly, including in a letter on May 15, 2012: Our disclosure to this oversight Committee of some material sought by the October 11 subpoena, such as records covered by grand jury secrecy rules and federal wiretap appli-cations and related information, is prohib-ited by law or court orders. 20 Despite these legal prohibitions, the Chair- man continued to threaten to hold the At-torney General in contempt for protecting these documents. He also publicly accused the Attorney General of a ‘‘cover-up,’’ 21 claimed he was ‘‘obstructing’’ the Commit-tee’s investigation, 22asserted that he is will- ing to ‘‘deceive the public,’’23and stated on national television that he ‘‘lied.’’24 IV. T HEDOCUMENTS AT ISSUE IN THE CON- TEMPT CITATION ARE NOT ABOUT GUNWALKING The documents at issue in the Contempt Citation are not related to the Committee’s investigation into how gunwalking was initi-ated and utilized in Operation Fast and Furi-ous. Over the past year, the Department of Jus- tice has produced thousands of pages of docu-ments, the Committee has interviewed two dozen officials, and the Attorney General has testified before Congress nine times. In January, Ranking Member Cummings issued a comprehensive 95-page staff report documenting that Operation Fast and Furi-ous was in fact the fourth in a series of gunwalking operations run by ATF’s Phoe-nix field division over a span of five years be-ginning in 2006. Three prior operations—Op-eration Wide Receiver (2006–2007), the Her-nandez case (2007), and the Medrano case (2008)—occurred during the Bush Administra-tion. All four operations were overseen by the same ATF Special Agent in Charge in Phoenix. 25 The Committee has obtained no evidence that the Attorney General was aware that gunwalking was being used. To the contrary, as soon as he learned of its use, the Attorney General halted it, ordered an Inspector Gen-eral investigation, and implemented signifi-cant internal reform measures. 26 After finding no evidence of wrongdoing by the Attorney General, the Committee’s in-vestigation shifted to focusing on a single letter sent by the Department’s Office of Legislative Affairs to Senator Charles Grass-ley on February 4, 2011. This letter initially denied allegations that ATF ‘‘knowingly al-lowed the sale of assault weapons to a straw purchaser who then transported them into Mexico’’ and stated that ‘‘ATF makes every effort to interdict weapons that have been purchased illegally and prevent their trans-portation to Mexico.’’ 27 The Department has acknowledged that its letter was inaccurate and has formally with-drawn it. On December 2, 2011, the Depart-ment wrote that ‘‘facts have come to light during the course of this investigation that VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00145 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4304 June 28, 2012 indicate that the February 4 letter contains inaccuracies.’’28 Acknowledging these inaccuracies, the De- partment also provided the Committee with 1,300 pages of internal deliberative docu-ments relating to how the letter to Senator Grassley was drafted. These documents dem-onstrate that officials in the Office of Legis-lative Affairs who were responsible for draft-ing the letter did not intentionally mislead Congress, but instead relied on inaccurate assertions and strong denials from officials ‘‘in the best position to know the relevant facts: ATF and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Arizona, both of which had responsibility for Operation Fast and Furious.’’ 29 Despite receiving these documents explain- ing how the letter to Senator Grassley was drafted, the Committee moved the goalposts and demanded additional internal documents created after February 4, 2011, the date the letter to Senator Grassley was sent. It is un-clear why the Committee needs these docu-ments. This narrow subset of additional doc-uments—which have nothing to do with how gunwalking was initiated in Operation Fast and Furious—is now the sole basis cited in the Contempt Citation for holding the Attor-ney General in contempt. 30 V. T HECOMMITTEE REFUSED A GOOD FAITH OFFER BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR AD- DITIONAL DOCUMENTS The Committee failed to honor its Con- stitutional responsibility to avoid unneces-sary conflict with the Executive Branch by seeking reasonable accommodations when possible. On the evening before the Commit-tee’s contempt vote, the Attorney General met with Chairman Issa, Ranking Member Cummings, Senator Grassley, and Senator Patrick Leahy. The Attorney General offered to take the following steps in response to the Committee’s demands for additional docu- ments. Specifically, the Attorney General: (1) offered to provide additional internal deliberative Department documents, created even after February 4, 2011; (2) offered a substantive briefing on the De- partment’s actions relating to how they de-termined the letter contained inaccuracies; (3) agreed to Senator Grassley’s request during the meeting to provide a description of the categories of documents that would be produced and withheld; and (4) agreed to answer additional substantive requests for information from the Com-mittee. The Attorney General noted that his offer included documents and information that went even beyond those demanded in the Committee’s subpoena. In exchange, the At-torney General asked the Chairman for a good faith commitment to work towards a final resolution of the contempt issue. 31 Chairman Issa did not make any sub- stantive changes to his position. Instead, he declined to commit to a good faith effort to work towards resolving the contempt issue and flatly refused the Attorney General’s offer. There is no question that the Constitution authorizes Congress to conduct rigorous in-vestigations in support of its legislative functions. 32The Constitution also requires Congress and the executive branch to seek to accommodate each other’s interests and to avoid unnecessary conflict. As the D.C. Cir-cuit has held: [E]ach branch should take cognizance of an implicit constitutional mandate to seek op-timal accommodation through a realistic evaluation of the needs of the conflicting branches in the particular fact situation. 33 Similarly, then-Attorney General William French Smith, who served under President Ronald Reagan, observed: The accommodation required is not simply an exchange of concessions or a test of polit-ical strength. It is an obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to ac-knowledge, and if possible to meet, the le-gitimate needs of the other branch. 34 VI. T HECOMMITTEE ’SDECISION TOPRESS FORWARD WITHCONTEMPT LED TO THE AD- MINISTRATION ’SASSERTION OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE After the Chairman refused the Attorney General’s good faith offer—and it became clear that a Committee contempt vote was inevitable—the President asserted executive privilege over the narrow category of docu-ments still at issue. The Administration made clear that it was still willing to nego-tiate on Congress’ access to the documents if contempt could be resolved. On June 20, 2012, Deputy Attorney General James Cole wrote to the Chairman to inform the Committee that ‘‘the President, in light of the Committee’s decision to hold the con-tempt vote, has asserted executive privilege over the relevant post-February 4 docu-ments.’’ 35An accompanying letter from At- torney General Holder described the docu-ments covered by the privilege as limited to ‘‘internal Department ‘documents from after February 4, 2011, related to the Department’s response to Congress.’’’ 36 Claims by House Speaker John Boehner and others that the Administration’s asser-tion of executive privilege raises questions about the President’s personal knowledge of gunwalking reflect a misunderstanding of the scope of the privilege asserted. 37Regard- ing the narrow subset of documents covered by the assertion, the letter from Attorney General explained: They were not generated in the course of the conduct of Fast and Furious. Instead, they were created after the investigative tactics at issue in that operation had termi-nated and in the course of the Department’s deliberative process concerning how to re-spond to congressional and related media in-quiries into that operation. 38 The Attorney General’s letter also ex- plained the Administration’s legal rationale for invoking executive privilege over inter-nal deliberative Justice Department docu-ments, citing opinions from former Attor-neys General Michael B. Mukasey, John Ashcroft, William French Smith, and Janet Reno, as well as former Solicitor General and Acting Attorney General Paul D. Clem-ent. 39The letter also quoted the Supreme Court in United States v. Nixon, writing: The threat of compelled disclosure of con- fidential Executive Branch deliberative ma-terial can discourage robust and candid de-liberations, for ‘‘[h]uman experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the deci-sionmaking process.’’ . . . Thus, Presidents have repeatedly asserted executive privilege to protect confidential Executive Branch de-liberative materials from congressional sub-poena. 40 VII. T HECOMMITTEE FAILED TORESPONSIBLY CONSIDER THE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE ASSER- TION Despite requests from several Committee Members, the Committee did not delay or postpone the business meeting in order to re-sponsibly examine the Administration’s as-sertion of executive privilege and determine whether it would be appropriate to continue contempt proceedings against the Attorney General. Instead of following the example of pre- vious Committee Chairmen who put off con-tempt proceedings in order to conduct a seri- ous and careful review of presidential asser-tions of executive privilege, Chairman Issa stated that ‘‘I claim not to be a constitu-tional scholar’’ and proceeded with the con-tempt vote. 41 In contrast, former Committee Chairman Henry Waxman put off a contempt vote after President George W. Bush asserted executive privilege in the investigation into the leak of the covert status of CIA operative Valerie Plame. 42He took the same course of action after President Bush asserted executive privilege over documents relating to the En-vironmental Protection Agency’s ozone regu-lation on the same day as a scheduled con-tempt vote. At the time, he stated: I want to talk with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle about this new develop-ment. I want to learn more about the asser-tion and the basis for this assertion of the executive privilege. 43 Although the Committee ultimately dis- agreed with the validity of President Bush’s assertions of executive privilege, in neither case did the Committee go forward with con-tempt proceedings against the officials named in the contempt citations. Similarly, Rep. John Dingell, as Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee during that Committee’s 1981 investigation into the Department of Interior, received an assertion of executive privilege from the Reagan Administration regarding documents pertaining to the administration of the Min-eral Lands Leasing Act. 44Before proceeding to contempt, the Committee held two sepa-rate hearings on the executive privilege as-sertion, and the Committee invited the At-torney General to testify regarding his legal opinion supporting the claim of executive privilege. 45 VIII. T HEINVESTIGATION HASBEEN CHARACTERIZED BY UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS The Committee’s investigation of ATF gunwalking operations has been character-ized by a series of unfortunate and unsub-stantiated allegations against the Obama Administration that turned out to be inac-curate. For example, during an interview on na- tional television on October 16, 2011, the Chairman accused the Federal Bureau of In-vestigation (FBI) of concealing evidence of the murder of Agent Brian Terry by hiding a ‘‘third gun’’ found at the murder scene. 46The FBI demonstrated quickly that this claim was unsubstantiated. 47Although the Chair- man admitted during a subsequent hearing that ‘‘we do go down blind alleys regularly,’’ no apology was issued to the law enforce-ment agents that were accused of a cover- up. 48 At the same time, the Chairman has de- fended the previous Administration’s oper-ations as ‘‘coordinated.’’ 49In response to a question about gunwalking during the Bush Administration, the Chairman stated: We know that under the Bush Administra- tion there were similar operations, but they were coordinated with Mexico. They made every effort to keep their eyes on the weap-ons the whole time. 50 To the contrary, the staff report issued by Ranking Member Cummings on January 31, 2012, documents at least three operations during the previous Administration in which coordination efforts were either non-existent or severely deficient. 51 In addition, the Chairman has stated re- peatedly that senior Justice Department of-ficials were ‘‘fully aware’’ of gunwalking in Operation Fast and Furious. 52After con- ducting two dozen transcribed interviews, none of the officials and agents involved said VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00146 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4305 June 28, 2012 they informed the Attorney General or other senior Department officials about gunwalking in Operation Fast and Furious. Instead, the heads of the agencies respon-sible for the operation—ATF and the U.S. Attorney’s Office—told Committee inves-tigators just the opposite, that they never informed senior Department officials about gunwalking in Operation Fast and Furious because they were unaware of it. 53 Finally, the Chairman has promoted an ex- treme conspiracy theory that the Obama Ad-ministration intentionally designed Oper-ation Fast and Furious to promote gunwalking. He stated in December 2011 that the Administration ‘‘made a crisis and they are using this crisis to somehow take away or limit people’s second amendment rights.’’ 54This offensive claim has also been made by Rush Limbaugh and other conserv-ative media personalities during the course of the investigation. For example, on June 20, 2011, Mr. Limbaugh stated: The real reason for Operation Gunrunner or Fast and Furious, whatever they want to call it now, the purpose of this was so that Obama and the rest of the Democrats can scream bloody murder about the lack of gun control in the U.S., which is causing all the murders in Mexico. This was a setup from the get-go. 55 Another conservative commentator stated that ‘‘their political agenda behind this en-tire thing was to blame American gun shops for cartel violence in America in order to push an anti-Second Amendment, more regu-lations on these gun shops.’’ 56Yet another one stated: This was purely a political operation. You send the guns down to Mexico, therefore you support the political narrative that the Obama administration wanted supported. That all these American guns are flooding Mexico, they’re the cause of the violence in Mexico, and therefore we need draconian gun control laws here in America. 57 As recently as this month, Committee Member John Mica repeated this claim on Fox News. On June 15, 2012, he stated: People forget how all this started. This ad- ministration is a gun control administra-tion. They tried to put the violence in Mex-ico on the blame of the United States. So they concocted this scheme and actually sending our federal agents, sending guns down there, and trying to cook some little deal to say that we have got to get more guns under control. 58 There is no evidence to support this con- spiracy theory. To the contrary, the docu-ments obtained and interviews conducted by the Committee demonstrate that gunwalking began in 2006, was used in three operations during the Bush Administration, and was a misguided tactic utilized by the ATF field division in Phoenix. 59 NOTES 1Letter from Rep.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4402 June 28, 2012 Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I call up the reso-lution (H. Res. 711) recommending that the House of Representatives find Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with a subpoena duly issued by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The Clerk read the title of the resolu- tion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 708, the resolu-tion is considered read and shall be de-batable for 50 minutes, equally divided and controlled by the chair and rank-ing minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform or their designees. The text of the resolution is as fol- lows: H. R ES. 711 Resolved , That Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attor- ney General of the United States, shall be found to be in contempt of Congress for fail-ure to comply with a congressional sub-poena. Resolved , That pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 192 and 194, the Speaker of the House of Representa-tives shall certify the report of the Com-mittee on Oversight and Government Re-form, detailing the refusal of Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, to produce documents to the Com-mittee on Oversight and Government Reform as directed by subpoena, to the United States Attorney for the District of Colum-bia, to the end that Mr. Holder be proceeded against in the manner and form provided by law. Resolved , That the Speaker of the House shall otherwise take all appropriate action to enforce the subpoena. The SPEAKER pro tempore. After debate on the resolution, it shall be in order to consider a motion to refer if offered by the gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. D INGELL ) or his designee which shall be debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent. The gentleman from California (Mr. I SSA) and the gentleman from Mary- land (Mr. C UMMINGS ) each will control 25 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani- mous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and in-sert extraneous materials into the R ECORD for both resolutions made in order under the rule. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. I never thought that we would be here today. I never thought this point would come. Throughout 18 months of investigation, through countless areas of negotiations in order to get the min-imum material necessary to find out the facts behind Fast and Furious and the murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, I always believed that, in time, we would reach an accommoda-tion sufficient to get the information needed for the American people while at the same time preserving the ongo-ing criminal investigations. I am proud to say that our com- mittee has maintained the ability for the Justice Department to continue their ongoing prosecutions. Neither the majority nor the minority has allowed any material to become public to com-promise that. However, the facts re-main—in Fast and Furious, the Depart-ment of Justice permitted the sale of more than 2,000 weapons that fell into the hands of the Mexican drug cartels, which was both reckless and inexcus-able. And it clearly was known by peo-ple, both career professionals and polit-ical appointees, from the lowliest members on the ground in Phoenix to high-ranking officials in the Depart-ment of Justice. But that’s not what we’re here for today. Today we are here on a very narrow contempt, one that the Speaker of the House, in his wisdom and assistance, has helped us to fashion. Let it be clear: we still have unanswered ques-tions on a myriad of areas related to Operation Fast and Furious. But today we are only here to determine how, over the 10 months from the time in which the American people and the Congress of the United States were lied to, given false—literally the reverse statement, that ‘‘no guns were allowed to walk’’ during those 10 months before the Justice Department finally owned up and recognized that they had to come clean that, in fact, Fast and Furi-ous was all about gunwalking. The Department of Justice main- tained a series of documents. Many of these documents are believed to be communications between and with the very individuals at the heart of the de-cision to go forward with Fast and Fu-rious. Therefore, we have focused our limited contempt on those documents. If our committee is able to receive the documents in totality that show who brought about the dishonest statement to Congress and who covered it up for 10 months, we believe that will allow us to backtrack to the individuals who ultimately believed in Fast and Furi-ous, facilitated Fast and Furious, and ultimately made it responsible for Brian Terry’s death. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ISSA. I yield myself an addi- tional 15 seconds. I won’t read everything that’s in my opening statement. But I will read just one more thing. These words were said on the House floor in 2008 when Speaker P ELOSI sup- ported contempt. She said: Congress has the responsibility of over- sight of the executive branch. I know that Members on both sides of the aisle take that responsibility very seriously. Oversight is an institutional obligation to ensure against abuse of power. Subpoena authority is a vital tool for that oversight. Speaker P ELOSI , 2008. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today, Mr. Speaker, is a historic day in many ways. On the one hand, in a landmark decision by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court upheld the health care bill, ensuring that millions of American families will finally have access to effective and af-fordable health care. On the other hand, Republican lead- ers of the House of Representatives are about to plunge into the history books as some of the most extreme and par-tisan ever. Rather than working to-gether in a bipartisan way to create jobs and help our Nation’s economic re-covery, they’re rushing to the floor under emergency procedures with a contempt resolution that is riddled with errors and is motivated by par-tisan politics. When I first heard about the allega- tions of gunwalking at ATF, I was out-raged. I fully supported our commit-tee’s goals of finding out how it start-ed, how it was used, and how it may have contributed to the death of Bor-der Patrol Agent Brian Terry. I made a personal commitment, which I will keep, to the Terry family to conduct a responsible and thorough inquiry. But today’s contempt vote is a cul- mination of one of the most highly po-liticized and reckless congressional in-vestigations in decades. After receiving thousands of pages of documents from the Justice Department, conducting two dozen transcribed interviews, and hearing testimony from the Attorney General nine times, here are the facts: First, the committee has obtained no evidence that the Attorney General au-thorized, condoned, or knew about gunwalking. Chairman I SSA admitted this just yesterday before the Rules Committee. We’ve seen no evidence that the Attorney General lied to Con-gress or engaged in a coverup. We’ve seen no evidence that the White House had anything to do with the gunwalking operations—Chairman I SSA admitted this on FOX News Sunday this past weekend. Democrats wanted a real investiga- tion. But Chairman I SSArefused 10 dif- ferent requests to hold a hearing with the director of ATF, the agency that ran these misguided operations. Let me say that again. During this entire in-vestigation, no Member of the House has been able to pose a single question to the head of ATF at a public hearing. How could you have a credible inves- tigation of gunwalking at ATF and never hold a single hearing with the leadership of the agency in charge? The answer is, you can’t. Based on the documents, we now know that gunwalking, in fact, started in 2006. Yesterday, Chairman I SSAsaid this about the misguided operations during the Bush administration: ‘‘They were all flops. They were all failures.’’ The committee has obtained docu- mentary evidence that former Attor-ney General Mukasey was personally VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00244 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4403 June 28, 2012 briefed on these botched interdiction efforts during his tenure and that he was told they would be expanded. Chairman I SSA refused to call Mr. Mukasey for a hearing or even for a private meeting. During our commit-tee’s year and a half investigation, the chairman refused every single Demo-cratic request for a witness. Instead of taking any of these rea- sonable steps as part of a credible and even-handed investigation to deter-mine facts, House Republican leaders rushed this resolution to the floor only 1 week after it was voted out of com-mittee. In contrast, during the last Congress, House leaders continued to negotiate for 6 months to try to avoid contempt in the United States Attor-neys investigation. Mr. Speaker, some of my colleagues on the other side seem almost giddy about today’s vote. After turning this investigation into an election year witch hunt, they have somehow con-vinced the Speaker to take it to the floor. b1440 And they are finally about to get the prize they have been seeking for more than a year: holding the Attorney Gen-eral of the United States of America in contempt. They may view today’s vote as a suc- cess, but in reality, it is a sad failure— a failure of House leadership, a failure of our constitutional obligations, and a failure of our responsibilities to the American people. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ISSA. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, the dis-tinguished Congressman M EEHAN , a former U.S. attorney in that district. Mr. MEEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chair- man. Mr. Speaker, this is not about poli- tics, though there are some who want to suggest that it is because if they yell loud enough and long enough, it will deflect the truth of the matter. Frankly, it’s not about ‘‘gotcha.’’ As a former prosecutor myself, the Attorney General personifies the pursuit of jus-tice, and I want to see him do well. But it is about accountability. Agent Brian Terry is dead, protecting our border, and 563 days later, the Terry family still does not know why it occurred. What they do know is that the very agency that initiated Fast and Furious, the Department of Justice under Attorney General Eric Holder, called the operation ‘‘fatally flawed.’’ And then the wagons got circled. It’s about the separation of powers. As uncomfortable as it may be, at times it’s a fundamental tenet and a strength of our democracy that Con-gress is given not just the power, but the responsibility, to exercise its duty of oversight over the Executive, espe-cially when, by their own admission, things have gone glaringly wrong. Because the Justice Department has stubbornly resisted the legitimate in-quiries of Congress over Operation Fast and Furious, there’s so much we do not know. But because whistleblowers within the Department of Justice were outraged at mischaracterizations, there’s a great deal that we do know. What we do know is that we have been dealing with a systematic effort to deflect attention away from the de-cisions and the determinations that were made at the highest levels of the Department of Justice, where informa-tion was brought directly to individ-uals at the highest levels of the De-partment of Justice, information that was contained in wiretap affidavits that lay out in explicit detail the mat-ters related to Fast and Furious. Mr. Speaker, there is a famous quotation in the Department of Justice about the responsibility of the Attor-ney General not being to win cases, but to assure that justice is pursued and retained. Mr. Speaker, it is incumbent and a responsibility on this House to do what is required to do in this circumstance and to support the request that we be given the documents to obtain the facts that will allow us to draw the conclusions which I believe will allow us to get to the bottom of this level. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gen-tleman from Illinois (Mr. Q UIGLEY ). Mr. QUIGLEY. Those bringing this contempt vote say they want to talk about gunwalking and how to stop it. Okay, let’s have that conversation. They say they want to stop gun traf- ficking and keep our ATF agents safe. Well, then let’s properly fund the ATF, which has the same number of agents since 1970. They say they want to stop gun traf- ficking. Well, then appoint a perma-nent ATF Director, which the agency hasn’t had in 6 years. They say they want to stop gun traf- ficking. Well, then let’s pass some laws which actually deter straw purchasers. Straw purchasers can currently buy thousands of AK–47s, lie on their paper-work, and the penalty is equivalent to a moving violation. They say they want to stop gun traf- ficking. Well, then let’s give the agents in the field what they’ve been asking for: the ability to track multiple pur-chases of long guns. These long guns include AK–47s, variant assault weap-ons, and .50 caliber semiautomatic sniper rifles, the weapons of choice for international drug cartels. They say they want to stop gun traf- ficking. Well, then let’s close the gun show loophole which currently allows anyone to purchase any gun they want without background check. Felons, do-mestic violence abusers, those with se-vere mental illness, even those on the terrorist watch list can currently walk into a gun show and purchase any gun they want. Yes, 2,000 guns were allowed to walk to Mexico, but the truth is tens of thousands of guns flow across our bor-der every year because of those lax gun laws. But those bringing this contempt vote don’t want to have this conversa- tion, and they aren’t serious about stopping gun trafficking. They simply want to embarrass the administration, even though the committee’s 16-month investigation found no evidence the At-torney General knew about gunwalking, even though there was no evidence of White House involvement in gunwalking, all of which Chairman I SSA admitted on national TV last week. So if we’re going to talk about gun trafficking, let’s be clear: this is about politics, not safety. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, the minority knows that, in fact, this contempt is all about the Attorney General’s re-fusal to turn over documents, not whether or not it was his lieutenants or he that personally was involved in Fast and Furious. With that, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. S ENSENBRENNER ). Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speak- er, this isn’t about politics. This is about the Constitution, and it’s about Congress’s mandate to do oversight over both the executive and judicial branches of government. The President is asserting executive privilege to attempt to shield these documents, and he is relying on a type of privilege called the deliberative process privilege. However, that privi-lege disappears when Congress is inves-tigating evidence of wrongdoing. In 1997, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit wrote, in part: Moreover, the privilege disappears alto- gether when there is any reason to believe government misconduct occurred. In another case that was decided by the First Circuit in 1995, it says that the grounds that shielding internal government deliberations in this con-text does not serve ‘‘the public’s inter-est in honest, effective government.’’ There’s been misconduct that’s al- ready a matter of public record in two instances. The Justice Department wrote Senator G RASSLEY in January of 2011 saying that the ATF-sanctioned gunwalking across the border was false, and it took them 9 months to re-tract that letter. So they misled Con-gress, and then 9 months later they said, Oops, maybe we did mislead Con-gress and we’ll withdraw the letter. And in May 2011, the Attorney General testified before the Judiciary Com-mittee that he first heard of Operation Fast and Furious a few weeks before the hearing. Over 6 months later, he conceded that he should have said ‘‘a few months.’’ Now, this very clearly shows that Congress has got the obligation to get to the bottom of this and that the as-sertion of executive privilege by the President and the Attorney General is not based in law. We ought to go ahead and do our job and do our oversight. It’s too bad that the Justice Depart-ment has decided to try to obstruct Congress’ ability to do it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4404 June 28, 2012 Pass the resolution. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 2 minutes to a member of the committee, the gen-tleman from Virginia (Mr. C ONNOLLY ). Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the 112th Congress is on the verge of becoming the first in the his-tory of the country to hold a sitting Cabinet member in contempt, cement-ing its legacy as the most partisan House of Representatives perhaps of all time. When they say it’s not about pol-itics, you can be sure it’s about poli-tics. The majority’s irresponsible and un- precedented contempt vote brings dis-honor to this House, which has become so clouded in judgment, so besotted with rancor and partisanship, that it’s incapable of addressing a fundamental separation of powers conflict in a seri-ous and fair fashion. In refusing to engage in good-faith negotiations with the Department of Justice and the Attorney General, the majority has exposed this contempt ci-tation for what it really is: an extraor-dinarily shameful political witch hunt aimed at trashing an honorable man. b1450 It is unacceptable that we are rush- ing to the floor this unprecedented con-tempt resolution. Yesterday, Ranking Member C UMMINGS sent a letter to the Speaker highlighting 100 errors, omis-sions, and mischaracterizations of fact contained in the contempt citation itself, rushed out of our committee last week on a party-line vote. Although some of the contempt cita- tion’s flaws are simply misleading, oth-ers are significant legal deficiencies and may contain factual errors that call into question the very validity of the contempt citation itself. For example, on pages 4 and 5, the contempt citation charges that senior officials at the Department of Justice headquarters ‘‘ultimately approved and authorized’’ Operation Fast and Furi-ous. However, the contempt citation fails to mention that the committee has uncovered no evidence that DOJ of-ficials, including the Attorney General, ever approved or authorized gunwalking in Operation Fast and Fu-rious. In fact, the authorization origi-nated at the ATF office in Phoenix, Ar-izona, not at DOJ headquarters in Washington. On pages 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, and 27, the contempt citation charges DOJ with not producing a series of doc-uments that the chairman only re-cently acknowledged the Department is prohibited by law from providing due to the potential impact on ongoing prosecutions. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield the gen- tleman an additional 15 seconds. Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia. In fact, he had to amend his own subpoenas to delete documents in this very category. But his contempt citation has not caught up with his most recent version of his subpoena. Clearly, the majority has not taken the necessary time to properly weigh this very serious charge. Regrettably, this deeply flawed and shoddy con-tempt citation is emblematic of the majority’s reckless rush to judgment throughout this political prosecution. I have been deeply troubled by the tone and tenor of some of the very hos-tile questioning and the utter and com-plete contempt and lack of respect given to the Attorney General of the United States. When this chapter of congressional history is written, it will not be a brave, shining moment. It will be seen for what it is: a craven, crass, partisan move that brings dishonor to this body. Mr. ISSA. I now yield 1 minute to the very distinguished and always partici-pating member of the committee, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. B UERKLE ). Ms. BUERKLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his steadfast work on behalf of truth in trying to get to the bottom of Fast and Furious. Mr. Speaker, Syracuse, New York, in the heart of my district, is roughly 2,500 miles from Rio Rico, Arizona, where U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was tragically shot and killed by an AK–47 assault rifle that the United States knowingly allowed into the hands of a suspected gun trafficker, yet every time I’m home, it is the issue first and foremost on the minds of my constituents. I listen to their calls, to their emails, and at our town halls. They want to know what happened, who knew what, and when did they know it. They ask me, they ask Wash-ington, they ask the Department of Justice: How could the United States Government, the pillar of hope and freedom, have allowed for this, for one of their own representatives, one of their own good guys, to be so helplessly gunned down by a suspected criminal? Mr. Speaker, I’m embarrassed to say that after 562 days, I still don’t have an answer for them. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ISSA. I yield the gentlelady an additional 10 seconds. Ms. BUERKLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask: Is this the hope that Americans are sup-posed to believe in out of the sup-posedly most-transparent government in the history of our Nation? It is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that the district court judge will see through the Attorney General’s contempt of Congress after it is passed in the House today. However, we must not be mis-taken, even if the Attorney General is prosecuted, the case is not closed. We must not forget that guns leaked through this program claimed lives. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ISSA. I yield the gentlelady an additional 10 seconds. Ms. BUERKLE. Mr. Speaker, after today’s vote, we must continue our ef-forts to find more answers than there are questions relating to this adminis-tration’s catastrophic Fast and Furi- ous. The American people deserve to know those answers, and the family of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry do as well. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. C LAY) 2 minutes, a member of the com- mittee. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Oversight Committee, I know that the gunwalking operations con-ducted by the ATF under both the pre-vious and current administrations were absolutely wrong. But the leadership of this House is focused on shameful elec-tion-year political posturing instead of the real issue. The Justice Department, long ago, ended the practice of allowing these guns to ‘‘walk’’ across the border, put-ting communities in Mexico at great risk. But the same people who have re-lentlessly pursued a baseless, partisan attack on Attorney General Holder and the President have ignored the des-perate pleas of the Mexican Govern-ment—to strengthen American gun laws and curb the gun trafficking that gave rise to the strategy in the first place. But focusing on the real issue would take time away from their playing pol-itics with their oversight authority. Those on the other side of the aisle claim to be concerned about powerful assault weapons crossing the border into Mexico illegally, but how can they be completely fine with those same powerful assault weapons being sold right here in this country legally, put-ting our communities at even greater risk? This is nothing more than a political witch hunt. The disgraceful posturing that I witnessed at last week’s markup has been continued on the floor today. I agree that it never should have come to this, but we are here debating this resolution solely because of the major-ity. They created the scandal and pro-duced a showdown during an election season just to smear an honorable, dedicated public servant and to embar-rass his boss. I urge my colleagues to reject this nakedly partisan abuse of power. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 1 minute to the distin-guished Speaker of the House, the gen-tleman from Ohio (Mr. B OEHNER ). Mr. BOEHNER. I thank my colleague for yielding. It’s important for the American peo- ple to know how we got here and to know the facts of this case. The Congress asked the Justice De- partment for the facts related to Fast and Furious and the events that led to the death of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. The Justice Department did not provide the facts and the infor-mation that we’ve requested. Instead, the information came from people out-side the Department, people who want-ed to do the right thing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4405 June 28, 2012 In addition to not providing the in- formation, the administration admit-ted misleading Congress, actually re-tracting a letter it had sent 10 months earlier. I think all Members understand this is a very serious matter. The Terry family wants to know how this hap-pened, and they have every right to have their answers. And the House needs to know how this happened, and it’s our constitutional duty to find out. So the House Oversight and Govern- ment Reform Committee issued a law-ful and narrowly tailored subpoena. We’ve been patient, giving the Justice Department every opportunity to com-ply so we can get to the bottom of this for the Terry family. We showed more than enough good faith, but the White House has chosen to invoke executive privilege. That leaves us no other op-tions. The only recourse left to the House is to continue seeking the truth and to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress. Now, I don’t take this matter lightly. I, frankly, hoped it would never come to this. The House’s focus is on jobs and on the economy. But no Justice Department is above the law, and no Justice Department is above the Con-stitution, which each of us has sworn an oath to uphold. So I ask the Members of this body to come together and to support this reso-lution so we can seek the answers that the Terry family and the American people deserve. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield myself 1 minute. I want to say in response to the Speaker, we, too, are all saddened by the tragic death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry who gave his life in service to his country on December 15, 2010. b1500 But, Mr. Speaker, despite what my colleagues have claimed, this contempt vote is not about getting documents that show how gunwalking was initi-ated and utilized in Operation Fast and Furious. Now, the only documents in dispute are the documents created after Fast and Furious ended and after Brian Ter-ry’s death, but we pledge to continue to find all the answers with regard to the death of Brian Terry. With that, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Massa-chusetts (Mr. L YNCH ), a member of the committee. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I would add that we have 31 Democrats that signed a letter to the Department of Justice and to the White House in the aftermath of Agent Terry’s death to fully cooperate in this investigation. However, I rise in strong opposition to this contempt resolution. While criticism of the Department of Justice for oversight of the so-called ‘‘gunwalking’’ operations—conducted during both the Bush administration and the current administration—may be warranted, a finding of contempt against the sitting Attorney General of the United States is most certainly not. In determining whether this House should hold our highest-ranking na-tional law enforcement officer in con-tempt of Congress, let us remember that up until last week the majority of our committee had been demanding the production of documents that our At-torney General is legally prohibited from disclosing and that has caused much of the delay here. In other words, Mr. Holder would have broken the law and likely compromised existing crimi-nal prosecutions if he adhered to the majority’s unreasonable request for materials that related to ongoing criminal investigations, Federal wire-tap communications under judicial seal, and documents also subject to grand jury secrecy rules. Let us also be mindful that we are considering the extent of cooperation, or noncooperation, of an Attorney Gen-eral who has appeared before Congress on nine separate occasions, whose Jus-tice Department has produced over 7,600 pages of documents to oversight investigators and who continues to offer significant accommodations in re-sponse to extraordinary and ever- changing requests for information. Meanwhile, the majority continues to deny any and all Democratic re-quests to publicly question, under oath, law enforcement officials, includ-ing former Director of the ATF, Ken Melson, the head of the very Agency that ran the gunwalking operations such as Fast and Furious. Accordingly, it’s become quite clear that what began as a legitimate and compelling oversight committee inves-tigation into Operation Fast and Furi-ous has deteriorated into an unfortu-nate example of politics and partisan-ship at their worst. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield the gen- tleman another 15 seconds. Mr. LYNCH. In closing, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose this contempt resolution. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. W ALBERG ). Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, there is no joy in today’s action; but the fact remains, 18 months after U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was mur-dered, the Justice Department has failed to hold anybody accountable for the mistakes of Operation Fast and Fu-rious. As a member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I have witnessed firsthand the stonewalling by the Department of Justice and At-torney General Holder. At every ques-tion, the Justice Department has re-fused to acknowledge what they know about the gunwalking tactics that led to Agent Terry’s death. Most recently, they have hid behind the President’s erroneous claims of executive privi-lege, an action the President de- nounced as lacking transparency when he was campaigning. The Department has stood in open defiance of Congress’ moral and constitutional obligation to conduct oversight of this affair. The family of Agent Terry deserves to know who approved Fast and Furi-ous. They have the right to know who had the power to stop this program be-fore he was murdered, and they need an explanation as to why the Department of Justice took 9 months to withdraw their false denial that they had ever let guns walk into Mexico. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ISSA. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds. Mr. WALBERG. To some on the other side of the aisle, it seems fine that the people who authorized this operation still work within the Department of Justice. I don’t agree. They’d rather play politics than uphold Congress’ right to investigate. Today’s vote is about accountability. It’s about making sure another 2,000 firearms don’t end up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels. And it’s about bringing closure to the Terry family. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and honor the memory of Brian Terry. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gen-tleman from Maryland (Mr. H OYER ). Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day for the House of Representa-tives. It is an irresponsible day for the House of Representatives. It is a day in which the majority party asked us to take an action that has never been taken in the history of America—never once—holding a Cabinet officer in con-tempt of the Congress. Now, there have been previous con- tempt citations—some promoted by Democratic committees and some pro-moted by Republican committees. The average time between committee ac-tion and consideration on the floor of this House is 87 days; time to reflect on an extraordinarily important action with consequences beyond the knowl-edge of anybody sitting here today. Now, I want to tell the chairman, with all due respect, I think this inves-tigation has been extraordinarily su-perficial. I think the chairman has failed to call witnesses that could in fact give relevant, cogent testimony on the issues to bear. That ought to be done. That is why I will strongly sup-port the motion of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. D INGELL ), who has served here longer than any of the rest of us and who is one of the strongest gun control rights supporters in this Congress. What his motion says is: let us re- flect. Let us bring thoughtful judg-ment. Let us not, every time that there is the opportunity, choose confronta-tion over cooperation and consensus. That has been the history of this Con-gress, confrontation over consensus every time, and America is suffering because of it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4406 June 28, 2012 I ask my friends on the Republican side of the aisle—who know me to be a bipartisan Member of this body who be-lieves in this institution and who cares about its actions and the precedent that they will set—don’t do this. Vote for this motion to refer. Give the chair-man the opportunity he should have taken before to have a full hearing, calling former Attorney General Mukasey, calling the former head of the ATF, calling agents who were per-sonally involved in this proceeding. I venture to say that there are very few Members who will vote on this issue who have read the committee proceedings, very few Members who have read the minority report or the majority report. Yet they’re about to take a historic vote to do what has never been done by any Congress—111 Congresses. Do not take this action. This is not about Republicans or Democrats. This is about our Constitu-tion, our country, our respect for a Na-tion of laws, not of men. That’s what this vote is about. We ought not to be voting as Republicans and Democrats; we ought to be voting as Americans, Americans committed to justice and fair process. b1510 I regret that I do not believe this committee has followed that. I believe that the political motivations behind this resolution are clear and pose a clear and present danger to this Na-tion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield the gen- tleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. HOYER. I want to thank the gen- tleman from Maryland, my colleague and my friend, for his leadership on this effort. When we vote on this referral, let us vote as Americans, as I said, not as a partisan issue. You may have the At-torney General in the future. It’s not the question of the party of the Attor-ney General. It is the question of whether or not this Congress is going to provide for equal treatment of all Attorney Generals and all Cabinet offi-cers. Let us vote for this motion to refer and give the committee the oppor-tunity it should take, and let us vote down this motion that should fail, and let us vote down these motions for con-tempt, and let us thoughtfully consider the equities of this issue. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 1 minute to the gen-tleman from Arizona (Mr. G OSAR ), an active participant, and from the dis-trict from which this event sprung. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, finding At- torney General Eric Holder, Jr. in con-tempt of Congress is long overdue, but welcome news for the American people, and especially for Arizonans. As I explained in my recent state- ment, Mr. Holder has shown his con-tempt and utter disdain for our con-stitutional rights, our border, Arizo-nans and all Americans; 115 Members of Congress agree that Americans lack confidence in Mr. Holder and his De-partment. Every Member of Congress should do their constitutional duty and hold the Attorney General to be in con-tempt today. The people of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, who deal with the unsecured borders and violent Mexican cartels on a regular basis, now must also live in fear of these firearms. Some have said that these charges against Attorney General Eric Holder are racially motivated, and I couldn’t disagree more. The violent cartels armed by our government have no re-gard for party ID or race. Throughout our Nation and, specifically, in Ari-zona, folks from all political parties and all races are now living in danger of this lethal violence due to the ac-tions of this administration. Make no mistakes about it, today’s vote is to deliver justice and account-ability for the Brian Terry family and the over 300 Mexicans who have died as a result of Fast and Furious. Time’s up. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. H OYER ). Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. On November 1, 2009, our Speaker stood on this floor, outraged about the process. We, too, are outraged about this process, and let me quote the Speaker: We will not stand for this. And I would ask my House Republican colleagues and those who believe that we should be here pro-tecting the American people, protecting our Constitution, not vote on this bill. Let’s just get up and leave. My colleagues may well follow that advice. Mr. ISSA. I yield myself 10 seconds, and have no doubt that the gentleman will walk off the floor. But his motion is asking us also to delay, into an elec-tion, getting an answer for the Terry family. I know that is not the wise course, and I strongly support that we do this today. With that, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. L ABRADOR ). Mr. LABRADOR. Mr. Speaker, I stand with a heavy heart in support of today’s contempt resolution. It puts us another step closer to holding the At-torney General accountable for this se-verely flawed operation and his failure to cooperate with Congress. The Attorney General has not only failed to produce all the relevant docu-ments; he has misled this Congress and thereby prevented us from uncovering the truth. So how can the Members of the minority say that an investigation is superficial when we don’t even have all the documents? When the Attorney General was be- fore the Committee on Oversight last year, I brought to light his historical pattern of willful ignorance. I high-lighted his lack of knowledge when under oath. He knows nothing, he says nothing, and he seeks for nothing. Never in my life have I met a man more unconcerned with the search for the truth. I’ve since become even more dis- turbed by the depth to which Mr. Hold-er and his allies will sink to stonewall justice. Yes, this is an unprecedented day, I agree with you. But not until now have we had an Attorney General have to re-tract so many statements made to the Congress of the United States, the duly elected Representatives of the people of the United States. Let us vote to support this motion for contempt. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time both sides have. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from Maryland has 6 1⁄4minutes remaining. The gentleman from Cali-fornia has 11 1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. M ALONEY ). Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, the family of Brian Terry deserves our re-spect, our condolences and our best ef-forts to finish the mission, to put an end to gun violence on the southern border. But instead of going after gun violence, this investigation has gone after the man that tried to stop the gun violence, the Attorney General. Chairman I SSA has acknowledged that Attorney General Holder did not know about the gunwalking operation. He has acknowledged that the Presi-dent and the White House did not know about the gunwalking operation. Both the White House and the Attorney Gen-eral have acknowledged that the gunwalking operation was a tragic mis-take, that it was badly executed, and that it originated under the Bush ad-ministration. It was Attorney General Holder that terminated the program and requested an extensive investigation of the oper-ation and how it was conducted. And the documents that they’re now re-questing in this ‘‘vast and spurious’’ investigation have absolutely nothing to do with gunwalking. If they were really interested in dis- covering the truth, the committee would have called Kenneth Melson, head of the ATF, as a witness. The chairman refused 10 different requests for a hearing with Mr. Melson—10 re-quests. Republicans have not granted one single Democratic witness request in 16 months. Not one. This is not about discovering the truth. This is about politics. This has become an obsessive political vendetta, pursuing a political agenda in a season of unusually ugly politics. If they were serious about ending gun violence, they would do what many ATF agents have suggested and put some teeth in the law; and that is why I authored, with my colleagues, a bill to make gun trafficking a Federal of-fense and strengthen penalties for straw purchases.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4407 June 28, 2012 This unprecedented contempt cita- tion is politics at its worst and why this body is held in such low esteem by the public now. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I place in the R ECORD at this time the statement by the Terry family regarding Congress-man J OHN DINGELL ’s criticism of the contempt vote. TERRY FAMILY STATEMENT WITH REGARD TO CONGRESSMAN JOHN DINGELL ’S CRITICISM OF CONTEMPT VOTE On Wednesday, Representative John Din- gell invoked the Terry family name while saying he would not back the contempt reso-lutions but instead wants the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to conduct a more thorough investigation into Operation Fast and Furious. Congressman Dingell represents the dis- trict in Michigan where Brian Terry was born and where his family still resides, but his views don’t represent those of the Terry family. Nor does he speak for the Terry fam-ily. And he has never spoken to the Terry family. His office sent us a condolence letter when Brian was buried 18 months ago. That’s the last time we heard from him. A year ago, after the House Oversight and Reform Committee began looking into Oper-ation Fast and Furious, one of Brian’s sisters called Rep. Dingell’s office seeking help and answers. No one from his office called back. Mr. Dingell is now calling for more inves- tigation to be conducted before the Attorney General can be held in contempt of Congress. The Terry family has been waiting for over 18 months for answers about Operation Fast and Furious and how it was related to Brian’s death. If Rep. Dingell truly wants to support the Terry family and honor Brian Terry, a son of Michigan, he and other mem-bers of congress will call for the Attorney General to immediately provide the docu-ments requested by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I’m sure that the gentlelady from New York recognizes that the right of a minority hearing has not been exercised, and that would have answered the ques-tions, as they are well aware, about bringing Kenneth Melson before the committee. That would be their right. They did not exercise their right. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. M ICA), the senior member of the committee. Mr. MICA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. When the Founding Fathers created our government and established the committees in Congress, they had au-thorizing committees and they had ap-propriating committees. In 1808, the predecessor of this committee was es-tablished for a fundamental reason, and that’s to make certain that pro-grams and funding were properly exe-cuted and used by agencies created by Congress. Congress created the law that cre- ated the Department of Justice. Con-gress funded the programs that are under the Department of Justice. It’s our responsibility to investigate when things go wrong. And things went wrong. An agent of the United States was murdered with weapons which were funded by the agency that we cre-ated. All we have asked for is the docu- ments. All we want are the facts, and we have been thwarted. Eric Holder, Attorney General of the United States, the highest judicial enforcement offi-cer of the United States, has been in contempt, is in contempt, and is show-ing contempt for the Congress and the responsibility under the Constitution of this important committee of Con-gress. I urge adoption of the contempt reso- lution against the Attorney General. b1520 Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. S CHIFF ). Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in strong opposition to these contempt resolutions. I spent 6 years as an assistant U.S. attorney, and I have great admiration and respect for the hardworking men and women of the Department. I have great respect for our Attorney General, who I think has been a superb Attorney General and is a man of great integ-rity. I, like most Americans, would like to know about the facts of Fast and Furious, about the problem of guns crossing our border, about the horren-dous violence to the south of our bor-der. But what we do today will shed no light on that. What we do today will not improve the situation in terms of gun violence that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Mexican citizens and that has claimed the lives of an increasing number of Americans. What we are doing today is simply a partisan abuse of the contempt power. Thirteen per-cent of the American people think highly of Congress, and today those 13 percent are wondering why. What we do will cause no injury to the Depart-ment, but it will cause great injury to this House. The Justice Department, after pro- viding 8,000 documents and extensive testimony, is now being required to turn over privileged materials; and like all administrations before it, it has re-luctantly used executive privilege to respectfully refuse to provide materials it cannot provide. So now we are here, bringing a contempt motion against the Attorney General, who our com-mittee chairman acknowledges was not aware of Fast and Furious. They don’t expect any documents to show he was aware of Fast and Furious. Yet we are going to hold this Cabinet official in contempt? That is an outrageous abuse of the contempt power. What will happen when this Congress actually needs to use the contempt power for a legiti-mate purpose? Will anyone still recog-nize it? I urge the Speaker to withdraw this motion as, indeed, Speaker Gingrich withdrew the motion in his day and let the parties work it out. We both know, Democrats and Republicans, how this will end. It will end with a settlement in court months or years from now and with the Department’s providing the same documents it’s offering to provide today. Let’s end this partisan exercise now. Mr. ISSA. I yield myself 15 seconds. I respect my colleague from Cali- fornia, as we came in to Congress to-gether some 12 years ago; but the fact is he talked about everything except the fact that Congress was lied to in a false letter and follow-up statement. Ten months went by. We’re only asking for the information related to the false statements made to Congress during that intervening period and nothing more. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California, the minority leader, Ms. P ELOSI . Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I commend him for his extraordinary patriotism, for his commitment to up-holding our oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution, and for recognizing full well the congressional role of oversight of all branches of gov-ernment. I think we all share the view that Congress has a legitimate role to play in oversight; thus, your com-mittee has so much jurisdiction, and I respect that. I think we also all agree—I think we all very, very much agree—that we are very sad and seek justice for the family of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. His loss is a tragedy for all who knew him, for all of us who care about him. We offer our condolences to his family. So sad. But that’s not what we are here to debate, what we agree upon. What we are here to debate is some- thing very, very large because it is a major disagreement between the two sides of the aisle here—and I’m sorry to say that—about what our responsibil-ities are to the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution re-quires Congress and the executive branch to avoid unnecessary conflict and to seek accommodations that serve both their interests. That’s how the Constitution guides us. As Attorney General William French Smith, who served under President Ronald Reagan, said: The accommodation required is not simply an exchange of concessions or a test of polit-ical strength. It is an obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to ac-knowledge and, if possible, to meet the le-gitimate needs of the other branch. Mr. Speaker, on the floor today, the Republicans in Congress are not mak-ing a principled effort to acknowledge or to meet the legitimate needs of the other branch. What they are doing is exploiting a very unfortunate cir-cumstance for reasons that I cannot even characterize, so I won’t; but I will say this without any fear of contradic-tion: The basic premise that this debate is predicated on today is a false premise. It is factually not true. In how many more ways can I say that? So we have VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00249 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

--- Page 249 ---
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4408 June 28, 2012 a debate predicated on a false premise. What can that lead to that has any good outcome? It is a situation in which we have a contempt of Congress resolution against a sitting Cabinet member, which is the first time in the over-200-year history of our country that this has ever happened. Again, what is the motivation? Secondly—and that’s why I quoted the Constitution—this motion is not a principled effort to resolve the issue. If it were, we would not be able to meas-ure in hours and days, not even weeks, the rush—the railroading—of a resolu-tion of contempt of Congress that the Republicans passed last week and are bringing this week to the House floor. I say this because I took considerable heat myself when we brought contempt charges against two staff people at the White House—Josh Bolton and Harriet Miers—4 1⁄2years ago. We were asking for some papers. We got nothing, as I said to my friends, not even a wrapper of a piece of gum. Nothing. Stonewalled. Nothing. Yet, at the time, our chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee, Mr. C ONYERS , and our House leadership, Mr. H OYER and others, kept saying, Find a way. Exhaust every remedy so that we do not have to take this action of bringing a contempt charge to the floor of the House. For over 200 days, we tried, we tried, we tried to resolve the situation. When we could not, we brought it to the floor—two staff people at the White House—which is in stark contrast to the rush of one week to the next for an unsubstantiated—not even factual— charge against the Attorney General of the United States. It may just be a coincidence—I don’t know—that the Attorney General of the United States, the chief legal offi-cer of our country, has a responsibility to fight voter suppression, which is going on in our country; has refused to defend the constitutionality of DOMA because he doesn’t believe it’s constitu-tional; or has some major disagree-ments on immigration, which fall under the enforcement of immigration law. b1420 It may just be a coincidence that those are part of his responsibilities, or maybe it isn’t. But the fact is is that the chief legal officer of our country and his staff have to spend enormous psychic and intellectual energy and time dealing with this unprincipled ef-fort on the part of the Republicans. Just when you think you have seen it all, just when you think they couldn’t possibly go any further over the edge, they come up with something like this. It’s stunning. It really is. I don’t mean that in meaning it’s beautiful. It’s stunning. It stops you in your tracks because you say: How far will they go? Have they no limits? Apparently, not. The temptation is to say: Let’s just ignore the whole thing, to not dignify what they’re doing by even being present on the floor when they do this heinous act, the first time in the his- tory of our country, to bring contempt against a Cabinet officer. You would think they’d be more careful about what they say. But being careful about what they say is apparently not part of their agenda. I know in our caucus there is a mixed response to this. They’re acting politi-cally; we should act politically. We shouldn’t vote on this; I want to vote ‘‘no.’’ I think Members have to make their own decision about that. I’m very moved by the efforts of our Congres-sional Black Caucus to say that they’re going to walk out on this. Perhaps that’s the best approach for us to take. How else can we impress upon the American people, without scaring them, about what is happening here? What is happening here? What is hap- pening here is shameful. What is hap-pening here is something that we all have an obligation to speak out against. Because I’m telling you it is Eric Holder today, and it’s anybody else tomorrow on any charge they can drum up. As has been said, the fact is that the papers that they have seen, they know are exculpatory. That means there is no blame on the Attorney General, and they know that. That’s why they don’t want to bring those responsible for this before their committee, and that’s why I commend Chairman D INGELL for his leadership in the motion that he will bring to the floor momentarily, a mo-tion of referral, so that we can get to the bottom of this, so that we can see how this happened, so that we can offer some solace to Brian Terry’s family, and so that we can have some sense of decency about what should happen on the floor of the House. It seems to me the more baseless the charge, the higher up they want to go with the contempt. The less they have to say that is real, the higher up they want to bring the contempt charge. I have always tried to make it a habit of not questioning the motiva-tion of people. They believe what they believe, we believe what we believe, and we act upon our beliefs. It always interested me that in this Congress somebody can bring something to the floor that is not true. But if I were to call someone a misrepresenter of that information, my words would be taken down. So I guess that gives them lib-erty to say anything because it’s in the form of a motion. Let’s make sure that we all take re- sponsibility for doing the right thing by not letting there be an abuse of power, an abuse of this floor of the House, an abuse of the time of the ex-ecutive branch, an abuse of the time of a member of the Cabinet who has seri-ous responsibilities to our country. I urge my colleagues to do what they want as far as walking off. I myself had said that I was coming to this floor to vote against this resolution. I thought it was so wrong that there was no ques-tion to take the opportunity to vote ‘‘no.’’ But listening to the debate, it is almost unbelievable. Not that what they’re saying is believable, but unbe-lievable that they would say it. I say to those who have a doubt about how they want to proceed, that instead of doing what I said before, which was just to come and treat this as a resolution before the Congress and express my ‘‘no,’’ after listening to the unconscionable presentation, I want to join my CBC colleagues in boycotting the vote when we have the walkout after we have the debate over Mr. D IN- GELL ’s motion. We all take our responsibilities seri- ously here, and one of them first and foremost is to support, uphold, and de-fend the Constitution of the United States. That Constitution requires the Congress and the executive branch—as I began—to avoid unnecessary conflict and seek accommodation to serve both interests, the executive branch and the legislative branch. We are not uphold-ing that aspect of the Constitution here. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ or a ‘‘no’’ vote, but to seriously reject. Let’s hope that this will not be re-peated. But I’m telling you, it’s Eric Holder one day, and you don’t know who it is the next because of the frivo-lousness with which they treat a seri-ous responsibility of the House of Rep-resentatives. It’s appalling. Mr. ISSA. As I know the former Speaker of the House knows, the Attor-ney General is being held in contempt as the custodian of the records for re-fusing to deliver them, and not because we got to choose how far up or not to go. With that, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. C HAFFETZ ). Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, Leader PELOSI seriously questioned our moti- vations here. Let me be crystal clear what my motivation is. We have a dead United States agent. We have more than 200 dead people in Mexico. We have more than 2,000 weapons that were knowingly and willfully given to the drug cartels. More than 1,000 of those weapons are still missing. Most of them are AK–47s. We have a duly issued subpoena that has not been re-sponded to. On February 4, 2011, on Department of Justice letterhead, they presented the United States Congress a letter that was a lie. It took them nearly 9 to 10 months to provide that information and say, Whoops, sorry. That’s not good enough. This is not about Eric Holder. This is about the Department of Justice and justice in the United States of Amer-ica. I would hearken back to the June 3, 2011, letter that 31 brave Democrats sent to the White House. I will read part of this. And remember, this is about a year ago: It is equally troubling that the Depart- ment of Justice has delayed action and with-held information from congressional inquir-ies. b1540 He went on to say: VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00250 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4409 June 28, 2012 While the Department of Justice can and should continue its investigation, those ac-tivities should not curtail the ability of Con-gress to fulfill its oversight duty. We urge you to instruct the Department of Justice to promptly provide complete answers to all congressional inquiries. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ISSA. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Nothing’s changed in over a year. But I will tell you this: Brian Terry doesn’t have answers. You don’t have answers. I don’t have an-swers. I want all the facts. That’s what we’re asking for today, the facts, all of them. Mr. CUMMINGS. I will remind the gentleman that all of this started under President Bush. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ISSA. I would recognize myself for 10 seconds. The distinguished gentleman from Maryland can have an opinion, but he can’t have his facts. Fast and Furious was an OCDETF op- eration that began under President Obama and Attorney General Holder. No ifs, no ands, no buts. And I would trust that the gentleman would no longer make statements that would be less than truthful. And I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield myself 15 seconds. Again, the gentleman puts out state- ments in search of facts. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ISSA. With that, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Indiana (Mr. B URTON ), the former chairman of the Oversight Committee. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I thank the gentleman for yielding. There has been a lot of hyperbole and a lot of repetition, but a lot of the things that have been said haven’t really been factual. So let’s look at the facts: Brian Terry was murdered. Hundreds of people have been murdered in Mex-ico with guns that went across the bor-der. The Justice Department said in February of 2011 that they had no knowledge about this, and then 10 months later, they admitted they lied. Now they said they didn’t know, and then they said they did. I don’t know what you call that, but to me, it’s a lie. Then Chairman I SSAtried again and again to get information so we could get to the bottom of this, like the 32 Democrats wanted, and they refused. He sent subpoenas; they refused. They hid behind this being an ongoing inves-tigation and they couldn’t give those documents. We got a fraction of the documents that should have been given to us, but they wouldn’t do that. I SSAmet with the Attorney General’s people to try to come to some conclu-sion, some kind of a resolution of this so we wouldn’t have to move the con-tempt citation; nothing, absolutely nothing. And then finally, at the 11th hour, when we knew that we were going to have to move with the contempt cita- tion, the President of the United States issues an executive order claim-ing executive privilege. Something is funny. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ISSA. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Something is wrong. There’s just no question. Something is being hidden from the Congress and the American people. And no matter how much is being said here tonight, the fact of the matter is we aren’t getting the information. A Border Patrol agent has been killed, maybe two. Hundreds of people have been killed in Mexico with Amer-ican guns that our government knew were going across that border. The At-torney General has not been giving us the information. The Justice Depart-ment has been hiding it from the Con-gress and the American people, and the President has claimed executive privi-lege. If that doesn’t tell you some-thing, nothing will. Mr. CUMMINGS. I reserve the bal- ance of my time. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I would in- quire of how much time is remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from California has 6 1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Mary-land has 1 1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. ISSA. I thank the Speaker. I submit the following: HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT ANDGOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC, May 24, 2012. Hon. E LIJAH E. C UMMINGS , Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representa-tives, Washington, DC. D EAR RANKING MEMBER CUMMINGS : Last February, I joined Senator Grassley in inves-tigating Operation Fast and Furious, the reckless and fundamentally flawed program conducted by the Phoenix Field Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). As you know, during Fast and Furious, ATF agents let straw pur-chasers illegally acquire hundreds of fire-arms and walk away from Phoenix gun stores. The misguided goal of this operation was to allow the U.S.-based associates of a Mexican drug cartel to acquire firearms so they could be traced back to the associates once the firearms were recovered at crime scenes. On December 15, 2010, two guns from the Fast and Furious operation were the only ones found at the scene of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry’s murder. AN ORGANIZED CRIME DRUG ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE (0CDETF) WIRETAP CASE Operation Fast and Furious got its name when it became an official Department of Justice Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Strike Force case. The OCDETF designation resulted in funding for Fast and Furious from the Justice De-partment’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. The Strike Force designation meant that it would not be run by ATF, but would instead create a multi-agency task force led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The designation also meant that sophisticated law enforcement techniques such as the use of federal wire intercepts, or wiretaps, would be employed. Federal wiretaps are governed by Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, and are sometimes referred to as ‘‘T– IIIs.’’ The use of federal wire intercepts requires a significant amount of case-related infor-mation to be sent to senior Department offi-cials for review and approval. All applica-tions for federal wiretaps are authorized under the authority of the Assistant Attor-ney General for the Criminal Division. In practice, a top deputy for the Assistant At-torney General has final sign-off authority before the application is submitted to a fed-eral judge for approval. This deputy must en-sure that the wiretap application meets stat-utory requirements and Justice Department policy. The approval process includes a cer-tification that the wiretap is necessary be-cause other investigative techniques have been insufficient. Therefore, making such a judgment requires a review of operational tactics. Since gunwalking was an investiga-tive technique utilized in Fast and Furious, then either top deputies in the Criminal Di-vision knew about the tactics employed as part of their effort to establish legal suffi-ciency for the application, or they approved the wiretap applications in a manner incon-sistent with Department policies. From the beginning, ATF was transparent about its strategy. An internal ATF briefing paper used in preparation for the OCDETF application process explained as much: Currently our strategy is to allow the transfer of firearms to continue to take place, albeit at a much slower pace, in order to further the investigation and allow for the identification of co-conspirators who would continue to operate and illegally traffic fire-arms to Mexican DTOs which are perpe-trating armed violence along the Southwest Border. * * * * * The ultimate goal is to secure a Federal T– III audio intercept to identify and prosecute all co-conspirators of the DTO. . . . Tracking the illegally-purchased guns after they left the premises of Federal Fire-arms Licensees (FFLs) would allow ATF and federal prosecutors to build a bigger case, one aimed at dismantling what was believed to be a complex firearms trafficking net-work. The task force failed, however, to track the firearms. Instead, according to the testimony of ATF agents, their supervisors ordered them to break off surveillance short-ly after the guns left the gun stores or were transferred to unknown third parties. Many of the firearms purchased were next seen at crime scenes on both sides of the border. THE FAST AND FURIOUS GUN TRAFFICKING NETWORK WAS NOT COMPLEX We now know the gun trafficking ring that Fast and Furious was designed to target was relatively straightforward. It involved ap-proximately 40 straw purchasers; a money- man, Manuel Celis-Acosta (Acosta), and; two figures tied to Mexican cartels. Acosta and the cartel figures were the top criminals tar-geted by ATF and the U.S. Attorney’s Office. On January 19, 2011, 20 suspects were in- dicted, including Acosta and 19 of his straw buyers. In all, it is believed that the Fast and Furious network purchased approxi-mately 2,000 firearms. An internal ATF docu-ment dated March 29, 2011, shows that of the indicted defendants, only a select few pur-chased the majority of the firearms, and nearly all of the purchases occurred after ATF knew that these defendants were straw purchasers working with Acosta. These four indicted defendants alone illegally purchased nearly 1,300 firearms: Uriel Patina (720), Sean Steward (290), Josh Moore (141), and Alfredo Celis (134).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4410 June 28, 2012 plan could have been conceived, approved, and implemented. Who in ATF and the Jus-tice Department knew about the volume of guns being purchased? Who approved of the case at various stages as it unfolded? Under whose authority did this occur? Who could have—and should have—stopped it? By close-ly examining this disastrous program, our Committee hopes to prevent similar reckless operations from using dangerous tactics like gunwalking ever again. Our investigation also aims to determine what legislative ac-tions might be necessary to ensure that such a program will not happen again. THE DEPARTMENT ’S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE COMMITTEE ’S SUBPOENAS Our Committee is still entitled to thou- sands of documents responsive to our sub-poenas. These documents will undoubtedly shed more light on the misguided tactics used in Operation Fast and Furious. If the Justice Department changes course and com-plies with the Committee’s subpoenas, some of these documents will cover the targets of an FBI investigation of the individuals who were the link between the drug cartels and the Fast and Furious firearms trafficking ring. Other documents will chronicle the De-partment’s response to allegations of whis-tleblowers following Agent Terry’s death and how it shifted its position from the outright denial that there was any misconduct to the Department’s formal withdrawal of its false statement in December 2011. Most importantly, as you are well aware, we are still waiting for documents relating to the individuals who approved the tactics employed in Fast and Furious. In his recent letter to me, Deputy Attorney General James Cole asserted that such documents ‘‘will not answer the question’’ of what sen-ior officials were in fact notified of the unac-ceptable tactics used in Fast and Furious. This statement is deeply misleading. We are aware of specific documents that lay bare the fact that senior officials in the Depart-ment’s Criminal Division who were respon-sible for approving the applications in sup-port of the Fast and Furious wiretap author-ization requests were indeed made aware of these questionable tactics. Cole’s letter goes on to state that ‘‘Department leadership was unaware of the inappropriate tactics used in Fast and Furious until allegations about those tactics were made public in early 2011.’’ That statement is even more mis-leading and utterly false. The information provided to senior officials in the affidavits accompanying the wiretaps includes copious details of the reckless investigative tech-niques involved. Senior department leaders were not only aware of these tactics. They approved them. WIRETAP APPLICATION OBTAINED BY THE COMMITTEE The Committee has obtained a copy of a Fast and Furious wiretap application, dated March 15, 2010. The application includes a memorandum dated March 10, 2010, from As-sistant Attorney General of the Criminal Di-vision Lanny A. Breuer to Paul M. O’Brien, Director, Office of Enforcement Operations, authorizing the wiretap application on be-half of the Attorney General. The memo-randum from Breuer was marked specifically for the attention of Emory Hurley, the lead federal prosecutor for Operation Fast and Furious. In response to your personal request, I am enclosing a copy of the wiretap application. Please take every precaution to treat it carefully and responsibly. I am hopeful that it will assist you in understanding the infor-mation brought to the attention of senior of-ficials in the Criminal Division charged with reviewing the contents of the applications to determine if they were legally sufficient and conformed to Justice Department policy. The information is as vast as it is specific. This wiretap application, signed by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Blanco under the authority of his supervisor, Assist-ant Attorney General Breuer, provides new insight into who knew—or should have known—what and when in Operation Fast and Furious. To assist you in better understanding the facts, I appreciate the opportunity to provide relevant and necessary context for some of the information in this wiretap application. Due to the sensitivity of the document, indi-vidual targets and suspects will be referred to with anonymous designations. You will notice, however, that the individuals re-ferred to in the wiretap application are well- known to our investigation. Although senior Department officials authorized this applica-tion on March 15, 2010, a mere four months after the investigation began, it contains a breathtaking amount of detail. The detailed information about the oper- ational tactics contained in the applications raises new questions about statements of senior Justice Department officials, includ-ing the Attorney General himself. Before the Senate Judiciary Committee on November 8, 2011, the Attorney General testified: I don’t think the wiretap applications—I’ve not seen—I’ve not seen them. But I don’t know—I don’t have any information that in-dicates that those wiretap applications had anything in them that talked about the tac-tics that have made this such a bone of con-tention and have legitimately raised the concern of members of Congress, as well as those of us in the Justice Department. I—I’d be surprised if the tactics themselves about gun walking were actually contained in those—in those applications. I have not seen them, but I would be surprise[d] [if that] were the case. At a hearing before our Committee on Feb- ruary 2, 2012, the Attorney General also de-nied that any information relating to tactics appeared in the wiretap affidavits. He testi-fied: I think, first off, there is no indication that Mr. Breuer or my former deputy were aware of the tactics that were employed in this matter until everybody I think became aware of them, which is like January Feb-ruary of last year. The information—I am not at this point aware that any of those tac-tics were contained in any of the wiretap ap-plications. Contrary to the Attorney General’s state- ments, the enclosed wiretap affidavit con-tains clear information that agents were willfully allowing known straw buyers to ac-quire firearms for drug cartels and failing to interdict them—in some cases even allowing them to walk to Mexico. In particular, the affidavit explicitly describes the most con-troversial tactic of all: abandoning surveil-lance of known straw purchasers, resulting in the failure to interdict firearms. The Justice Department’s Office of En- forcement Operations reviews the wiretap applications to ensure that they are both le-gally sufficient and conform to Justice De-partment policy. Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole has verified this under-standing. In a letter he sent to Congress on January 27, 2012, he stated that the Depart-ment’s ‘‘lawyers help AUSAs and trial attor-neys ensure that their wiretap packages meet statutory requirements and DOJ poli-cies. When Assistant Attorney General Breuer testified last November about the wiretap approval process, however, he stated: [The role of the reviewers and the role of the deputy in reviewing Title Three applica-tions is only one. It is to insure that there is legal sufficiency to make an application to go up on a wire, and legal sufficiency to peti-tion a federal judge somewhere in the United States that we believe it is a credible re-quest. But we cannot—those now 22 lawyers that I have who review this in Washington— and it used to only be seven—can not and should not replace their judgment, nor can they, with the thousands of prosecutors and agents all over the country. Theirs is a legal analysis; is there a sufficient basis to make this request. Assistant Attorney General Breuer failed to acknowledge that before a wiretap appli-cation can be authorized, it must adhere to Justice Department policy. Yet, the oper- ational tactics included in the enclosed wire-tap application—including abandoning sur-veillance and not interdicting firearms—vio-late Department policy. According to Deputy Attorney General Cole, operations allowing guns to cross the border do indeed violate Department policy. In an e-mail he sent to southwest border U.S. Attorneys on March 9, 2011, Deputy Attorney General Cole stated, ‘‘I want to reiterate the Department’s pol-icy: We should not design or conduct under-cover operations which include guns crossing the border.’’ The Committee understands the limita- tions of the Office of Enforcement Oper-ations function. Nevertheless, when pre-sented with alarming details such as those contained in this application, a sensible law-yer—vested with the important responsi-bility of recommending to the Assistant At-torney General whether a wiretap should be authorized—must raise the alarm. Senior of-ficials reviewing the application for legal sufficiency and/or whether Justice Depart-ment policy was followed, however, failed to identify major problems that these manifold facts suggested. MARCH 2010 WIRETAP APPLICATION STATES THE MAIN SUSPECT HAD INTENT TO ACQUIRE FIRE - ARMS FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRANSPORTING THEM TO MEXICO According to the wiretap application ob- tained by the Committee, as early as Decem-ber 2009, the task force had identified the main suspect in Fast and Furious (Target 1), a figure well-known to our investigation. The affidavit provides transcripts of entire conversations obtained through a prior DEA wire intercept. These conversations dem-onstrate that key suspects in Operation Fast and Furious were running a firearms traf-ficking ring. In one conversation that took place on December 11, 2009, Unknown Person 1 asks, ‘‘Can you hold them [firearms] for me there for a little while there?’’ Target 1 re-sponds, ‘‘Well it’s that I do not want to have them at home, dude, because there is a lot of . . . uh, it’s too much heat at my house.’’ Unknown Person 1 then asked where he could store the firearms and Target 1 re-sponds, ‘‘[m]ake arrangements with that guy [Straw Purchaser X], call him back and make arrangements with him.’’ The affidavit acknowledges that while monitoring the DEA target telephone numbers, law enforce-ment officers intercepted calls that dem-onstrated that Target 1 was conspiring to purchase and transport firearms for the pur-pose of trafficking the firearms from the United States to Mexico. MARCH 2010 WIRETAP APPLICATION STATES THAT NEARLY 1 ,000 FIREARMS HAD ALREADY BEEN PURCHASED , AND THAT MANY WERE RECOV - ERED IN MEXICO The Probable Cause section of the affidavit shows that ATF was aware that from Sep-tember 2009 to March 15, 2010, Target I ac-quired at least 852 firearms valued at ap-proximately $500,000 through straw pur-chasers. As of March 15, 2010, twenty-one straw purchasers had been identified. Be-tween September 23, 2009, and January 27, 2010, 139 firearms purchased by these straw VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00252 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4411 June 28, 2012 purchasers were recovered—81 of which were in Mexico. These recoveries occurred one to 49 days after their purchase in Arizona. MARCH 2010 WIRETAP APPLICATION DESCRIBES HOW SMUGGLERS WERE BRINGING FIREARMS INTO MEXICO The wiretap affidavit details that agents were well aware that large sums of money were being used to purchase a large number of firearms, many of which were flowing across the border. For example, in the span of one month, Straw Purchaser Z bought 241 firearms from just three cooperating FFL,s. Of those, at least 57 guns were recovered shortly thereafter either in the possession of others or at crime scenes on both sides of the border. The wiretap affidavit even shows that ATF agents knew the tactics the smug-glers were using to bring the guns into Mex-ico. According to the affidavit: The potential interceptees conspire with each other and others known to illegally traffic firearms to Mexico. The potential interceptees purchase firearms in Arizona and transport them to Mexico or a location in close proximity of the United States/Mexico border. The poten-tial interceptees deliver the firearms to indi-vidual(s) both known and unknown who then transport them into Mexico and/or the po-tential interceptees transport the firearms across the border and deliver them to cus-tomers both known and unknown. The fact that ATF knew that Target 1 had acquired 852 firearms and had the present in-tent to move them to Mexico should have prompted Department officials to act. De-partment officials should have ensured that the firearms were interdicted immediately and that law enforcement took steps to dis-rupt any further straw purchasing and traf-ficking activities by Target 1. Similarly, by way of example, if Criminal Division attor-neys were reviewing a wiretap affidavit that showed that human trafficking was taking place for the purpose of forcing humans into slavery, the attorneys should act to make sure such a practice would not continue. Ac-cordingly, Target l’s activities should have provoked an immediate response by the Criminal Division to shut him and his net-work down. MARCH 2010 WIRETAP APPLICATION CONTAINS DETAILS OF DROPPED SURVEILLANCE The wiretap affidavit also describes fire- arms purchases by individual straw pur-chasers. For example, Straw Purchaser Y purchased five AK–47 type firearms on De-cember 10, 2009, and surveillance units ob-served Straw Purchaser Y travel from the FFL where he made the purchase to Target l’s residence. The next day, surveillance units observed Straw Purchaser Y purchase an additional 21 AK–47 type firearms, and within an hour, arrive at Target l’s home. On December 8, 2009, agents observed Straw Purchaser Z purchase 20 AK–47 type firearms. While Straw Purchaser Z was mak-ing this purchase, Z saw a commercial deliv-ery truck arrive at the gun store with a ship-ment of an additional 20 AK–47 type fire-arms. Straw Purchaser Z then told FFL em-ployees that he wanted to purchase those ad-ditional firearms. Later that same day, Straw Purchaser Z returned to the FFL to buy them. After Straw Purchaser Z left the FFL with the firearms, Phoenix police offi-cers conducted a vehicle stop on Straw Pur-chaser Z’s vehicle and identified two of the passengers as Straw Purchaser Z and Target 1. The officers observed the firearms in the bed of the truck and asked the subjects about the firearms. Straw Purchaser Z told them he had purchased the firearms and they belonged to him. ATF agents continued sur-veillance until the vehicle arrived at Target l’s residence. The very next day, nine of these firearms were recovered during a police stop of a third person in Douglas, Arizona, on the U.S.-Mex-ico border. Five days later, Straw Purchaser Z bought another 43 firearms from an FFL. On December 24, 2009, Straw Purchaser Z bought even more firearms, purchasing 40 AK–47 type rifles from an FFL. All of these rifles were recovered on January 13, 2010, in El Paso, Texas, near the U.S./Mexico border. Although the individual found in possession of all these guns provided the first name of the purchaser, agents did not arrest the indi-vidual or the purchaser. Though the wiretap application states that agents were conducting surveillance of known straw purchasers, none of these weap-ons were interdicted. No arrests were made. MARCH 2010 WIRETAP DETAILS HOW FAST AND FURIOUS FIREARMS HAD BEEN FOUND AT CRIME SCENES IN MEXICO The wiretap affidavit also details the very sort ‘‘time-to-crime’’ for many of the fire-arms purchased during Fast nd Furious. For example, on November 6, 2009, November 12, 2009, and November 14, 2009, Straw Purchaser Y purchased a total of 25 AK–47 type firearms from an FFL in Arizona. On November 20, 2009—just eight days later—Mexican officials recovered 17 of these firearms in Naco, So-nora, Mexico. Another straw purchaser, Straw Purchaser Q, purchased a total of 17 AK–47 type firearms from an FFL on Novem-ber 3, 2009, November 10, 2009, and November 12, 2009. Then, on December 9, 2009, Mexican officials recovered 11 of these firearms in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, along with approximately 421 kilograms of cocaine, 60 kilograms of methamphetamine, 48 addi-tional firearms, 392 ammunition cartridges, $2 million in U.S. currency, and $800,000 in Mexican currency. Once again, although ATF was aware of these facts, no one was arrested, and ATF failed to even approach the straw purchasers. Upon learning these details through its re-view of this wiretap affidavit, senior Justice Department officials had a duty to stop this operation. Further, failure to do so was a violation of Justice Department policy. STRAW PURCHASERS HAD MEAGER FINANCIAL MEANS The affidavit provides details of the straw purchasers’ financial records. As of March 15, 2010, just four straw purchasers had spent $373,206 in cash on firearms. Yet, these same straw purchasers had only minimal earnings in Fiscal Year (FY) 2009. Straw Purchaser Q earned $214 per week, while Straw Purchaser Y earned only $188 per week. Straw Pur-chaser Z earned $9,456.92 during FY 2009, and Straw Purchaser X did not report any in-come whatsoever. Name Money spent on firearms by 3/15/10 FY 2009 income* Straw Purchaser Y ........................ $128,580 $9,776 Straw Purchaser Q ........................ 64,929 11,128 Straw Purchaser X ........................ 39,663 None reported Straw Purchaser Z ........................ 140,034 9,456 Total ..................................... $373,206 *Incomes based on weekly incomes detailed in wiretap application. These straw purchasers did not have the fi- nancial means to spend tens of thousands of dollars each on guns. Yet, ATF allowed them to continue acquiring firearms without ap-proaching them to inquire how they were able to obtain the funds to do so. ATF also failed to alert the FFLs with this informa-tion so that they could make more fully in-formed decisions as to whether to continue selling to these straw purchasers. CONCLUSION The wiretap affidavit reveals a remarkable amount of specific information about Oper-ation Fast and Furious. The affidavit reveals that the Justice Department has been mis-representing important facts to Congress and withholding critical details about Fast and Furious from the Committee for months on end. As the primary investigative arm of Congress, our Committee has a responsi- bility to demand answers from the Depart-ment and continue the investigation until we get all the facts. Sincerely, D ARRELL ISSA. Chairman. Mr. ISSA. I now yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. L ANKFORD ). Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. Speaker, this is a truly sad day. This is not stunning, as I have heard. This is a deliberative process that we’ve tried to work through. We have a border agent that’s been killed. We have hundreds of Mexicans that have been killed. And the finger-prints on all of that go straight back to an operation that was done by the Fed-eral Government. This is a moment to get all of the facts, to get it on the table, find out what happened, and to get it done. Now, we started with a subpoena process, over 22 different categories. We narrowed that down to one. How do we get the documents from the time of February 4 of last year, when the De-partment of Justice told us one thing, and December, when they said, Oops, and changed their story? We found out that they had not told us the truth. And in that time period when they stalled, stalled, stalled, stalled, we just want the information on that. How did this occur? This is essential because Phoenix ATF had a plan, Fast and Furious. It was then approved by the U.S. attorney in that area, and then went up the food chain to the Department of Justice, where it was signed off. This is not ir-relevant. It is essential that we know the process of how this was done. If we’re going to fix this problem, we’ve got to know the facts. Instead, they’re being withheld. Mr. CUMMINGS. I will continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, as a point of inquiry, do I have the right to close? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from California has the right to close. Mr. ISSA. Then I will reserve my right to close. Mr. CUMMINGS. Does the gentleman have any further requests for time? Mr. ISSA. No, I do not. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, as the Democratic leader said, there is no doubt that the Constitution gives Con-gress the right and responsibility to in-vestigate. But the Constitution also re-quires something else. It requires Con-gress and the executive branch to avoid unnecessary conflict and deceit, ac-commodations that serve both of their interests. In this case, the Attorney General has testified nine times. He has pro-vided thousands of pages of documents. He has provided 13 pages of deliberative VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00253 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4412 June 28, 2012 internal documents, and he is willing to provide even more to me, the recent demands of Chairman I SSA. But House Republican leaders are not honoring their constitutional obliga-tions. In fact, they are running in the wrong direction as quickly as possible. It is fundamentally wrong to vote in favor of this resolution at this time when the Attorney General has been working with the House in good faith. I believe this action will undermine the standing of the House, will cement the Speaker’s legacy, and will be recorded by history as a discredit to this insti-tution. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ISSA. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, there’s been a lot of talk about the documents that the At-torney General couldn’t give us. These documents, documents under seal, would be an example of documents that we should not see, except in camera, and we’ve taken great care to ensure that no one outside Members of Con-gress and key staff have ever looked at them. But I’ve looked at them, and what I know is that these documents, read by any person of ordinary learning, make it very clear that these wiretap appli-cations were read and signed by indi-viduals in the Department of Justice in Washington. And if you read them, you knew they were gunwalking. People will tell you differently. I give you my word: You read this, you know they were letting guns go to Mexico. They knew who the buyers were, who the intermediaries were, who the recipients were, and, most importantly, where they ended up. And there are reports in here, as part of the evidence given to judges in order to get wiretaps—there is evidence that they knew that, in fact, weapons had already ended up in Mexico. That’s before Brian Terry was killed. That’s how Fast and Furious could have been stopped. That’s how people could have been warned. In fact, that’s at a time in which ATF agents in Mex-ico City, if they punched in the serial number of a weapon found there, they got an erroneous, an error. They did not get meaningful information be-cause that was being blocked—not by ATF, per se, but by the Department of Justice under the auspices of the U.S. attorney and his bosses. b1550 Now you’re going to hear that this began under President Bush and Attor-ney General Mukasey. I’m going to tell you that’s just false. What happened in previous administrations with some of the same local ATF agents was they exercised extremely bad judgment. They did things and pushed on pro-grams that I believe were poorly con-ceived and poorly manned and as a re-sult they lost track of weapons repeat-edly. That happened. And it was wrong. The U.S. attorney at the time even de-clined prosecutions because of failed techniques. All of these were shut down during the Bush administration. President Bush can take no credit for it. He didn’t know it. As far as I know, the Attorney General didn’t know. And anyone who saw the record of that should say: This was wrong-minded. But during this administration, during the time in which the Attorney Gen-eral and his key lieutenants, including Lanny Breuer, were in charge, they re-opened the prosecutions from a failed program called Wide Receiver and they opened Fast and Furious. Now I’m the second child in a family. I have an older brother. I learned at a very young age you in fact cannot, when you do something wrong, say: My brother Billy did it. It doesn’t work that way. You’re responsible for what you do wrong, whether it happened be-fore your watch or not. This happened on the Attorney General’s watch. But that’s not why we’re here today. We’re here because when we asked le-gitimate questions about Brian Terry’s murder, about Fast and Furious, we were lied to. We were lied to repeatedly and over a 10-month period. The fact is that is what we’re here for. The Amer-ican people want to know if you give false testimony to Congress. The minority leader talked about, Why is there such a hurry? Why was there a 10-month delay? I was sworn in just a few days before this investiga-tion began, and now we’re nearing an election. We don’t want to have this during an election. We want to have resolution for the Terry family. The important thing is, we know enough to know that we have people who have told us under penalty of criminal prosecution—they have told Congress and their employees certain documents exist. And we’ve asked for those documents. And we’ve been de-nied them. We can’t bring Kenneth Melson back in in good faith and say, Well, we’ve got to get them in front of our committee, if in fact there’s docu-ments he says exist. And they do, and they will not be given to us. We want to have those so we can ask the best questions. You’ve heard earlier that in fact we’ve denied somehow due process to the minority. My ranking member is very capable, and has asked for minor-ity days; in other words, hearings ex-clusively for him. He chose not to do it. When we were having the local ATF and other individuals in early on, all of whom worked for this government, he didn’t even ask for any. It wasn’t until we asked to have the Attorney General come in, based on these false state-ments and final retraction, that he suddenly wanted a previous Attorney General, who happened to say, No, I don’t want to come. So on that par-ticular day we would have had to sub-poena him to get him in. I have no ob-jection to having the former Attorney General in. I believe that on his watch and his predecessor’s watch and his predecessor’s watch and for a very long time we have not done a good job of overseeing the actions of field agents when it comes to guns. But, again, we’re here today, for the first time in over 200 years, to deal with an Attorney General who has flat- out refused to give the information re-lated to lies and a coverup exclusively within his jurisdiction. That’s what we’re voting on. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the contempt on behalf of the Terry family. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the resolution has ex-pired. MOTION TO REFER Mr. DINGELL. I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to refer. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Dingell of Michigan moves to refer the resolution, H. Res. 711, to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform with in-structions to: (1) Hold a bipartisan public hearing with testimony from Kenneth Melson, the former Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives during Operation Fast and Furious. (2) Hold a bipartisan public hearing with testimony from William Hoover, the former Acting Deputy Director of the Bureau of Al-cohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives during Operation Fast and Furious. (3) Hold a bipartisan public hearing with testimony from former Attorney General Mi-chael Mukasey, who, according to documents produced to the committee, was informed during his tenure that, although efforts to coordinate firearm interdictions with Mexi-can law enforcement officials in 2007 ‘‘have not been successful’’, the ‘‘ATF would like to expand’’ such efforts. (4) Conduct a bipartisan transcribed inter- view of Alice Fisher, who served as the As-sistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice from 2005 to 2008, about her role in authorizing wiretaps in Operation Wide Receiver. (5) Conduct a bipartisan transcribed inter- view of Kenneth Blanco, who serves as Dep-uty Assistant Attorney General at the De-partment of Justice and also authorized wiretaps in Operation Fast and Furious. (6) Take such further actions as the com- mittee, with full bipartisan consultation, deems appropriate to assure a thorough and vigorous investigation of this matter. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4413 June 28, 2012 Tobacco, and Firearms and Explosives, called the ATF. This is a tragedy. I have had the entirety of the motion read so that we can understand what a real investigation is. I didn’t roll off the cabbage wagon yesterday, Mr. Speaker. I chaired committees for over 20 or 30 years, and I have conducted more investigations than any man in this particular body. It is clear that the events here were characterized by dishonest, evasive, and deceitful activi-ties on the part of ATF personnel. I want to find out what has happened. This is not the first time I’ve crossed swords with ATF and this is not the first time I have found them engaged in shameful, illegal, and improper behav-ior. In one instance, I caught them raiding the home of an individual. They shot him in the brain and they pitched his wife, in her underpants, out into the hall. Operation Fast and Furious was a highly irresponsible operation that never should have occurred. People on both sides of this aisle agree to that. The American people want the answers and they deserve to have a proper, thorough, and bipartisan investigation that gets them the truth. My con-stituent Brian Terry wants the truth from the grave, and his families asks that we get the truth. With God as my judge, they deserve it, and they shall have it if I can get it for them. I have shared scores of investigations and hearings over 50 years on wrong-doing which have collected hundreds of millions of dollars wrongfully taken from our people and have caught more than a few serious wrongdoers, who have paid proper penalties for their wrongdoing. These investigations were always bi- partisan, with both sides of the aisle actively participating and fully in-formed. The actions of the committee were unanimously conducted and sup-ported by Members on both sides of the aisle. What we see before us does not follow that model, and it brings no re-spect to this body. As someone who holds the institution here in the high-est regard, I find this to be most trou-bling. Instead of going after the real an- swers and getting the facts about what happened at ATF, the majority of the committee has engaged in what ap-pears to be a partisan political witch hunt, with the Attorney General as its target. Over the 16-month investiga-tion, Democrats were not permitted to call a single witness to testify. So much for bipartisanship. The American people deserve better than this, Mr. Speaker. They deserve a legitimate in-quiry based on facts which all Members of this body can support. b1600 This is not a Second Amendment question. I have defended the Second Amendment more than any Member of this body, and I am a past member of the board of directors of NRA and a life member of that body. We deserve, and the American people deserve, a legiti- mate inquiry based on the facts. It seems to me there’s a simple way to resolve this dispute. First, adopt the resolution. Then see to it that the At-torney General produces the docu-ments that are currently at issue, and I will actively support the gentleman and see to it that those facts and docu-ments are presented. Second, the House Republicans should give a good-faith commitment to work towards resolving the con-tempt fight. If the documents in fact are consistent with the Attorney Gen-eral’s testimony that he never author-ized or approved or knew about gunwalking, then I think we should consider the matter of contempt re-solved. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. DINGELL. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. I respect the gentleman from Michi- gan, the dean of the House, but you’re just wrong. There were plenty of oppor-tunities for the minority to ask for witnesses. They chose not to except at one hearing, and then they wanted the former Attorney General. They did not avail themselves of the procedures al-lowing them to have a hearing even though they know how to do it and have done it. But more importantly, when you say you represent Brian Terry, you do not. The Terry family issued this state-ment, referring to Congressman D IN- GELL : His views don’t represent those of the Terry family. Nor does he speak to the Terry family. And he has never spoken to the Terry family. Secondly: His office sent us a condolence letter when Brian was buried 18 months ago. That’s the last time we heard from him. Third: A year ago, after the Oversight and Gov- ernment Reform Committee began its work, one of Brian’s sisters called Representative D INGELL ’s office seeking help and answers. No one from his office called back. Lastly: If Rep. Dingell truly wants to support the Terry family and honor Brian Terry, a son of Michigan, he and other Members of Congress will call for the Attorney General to imme-diately provide the documents requested by the House Oversight and Government Re-form Committee. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DINGELL. I yield myself the bal- ance of my time. Well, I was aware of this. I have com- municated with the family my sorrow at their loss, and my office is setting up a meeting with the Terry family as soon as I can get back to Michigan. My motion here would ensure that the witnesses the minority has re-quested, including the former Director of ATF during the time of this oper-ation, are called for a full, open public hearing to ensure that the American people get the whole story. I’m not here solely representing the interests of the Terry family. I’m here representing the interests of the whole country and all of the 800,000 people that I serve in the 15th District of Michigan. As I’ve said on a number of occasions in the last year, Congress has two choices in their decisionmaking: we can work together and get something done, or we can play political football. I choose to get something done, which is why I have offered a resolution. And if you have listened to what I had read by the Clerk, you will observe that it says we want a full, thorough, bipar-tisan investigation. That’s the way the matter should be done. And Members on this side will support the findings of that investigation if the chairman of that committee will permit this kind of undertaking to be begun. I would observe this very interesting fact. The contempt resolution is going to give the same instructions to the same fellow who is under contempt. He will simply put it in his pocket, and we will find that this body has been weak-ened in its dealings with the executive branch. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I now yield all remaining time to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. G OWDY ), an experienced prosecutor, to close. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from South Carolina is recog-nized for 4 minutes. Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. This is a sad day, Mr. Speaker, for those of us who respect the rule of law as the foundation of this Republic, for those of us who proudly worked for the Department of Justice, for those of us who believe the same rules apply to ev-eryone regardless of whether they live simple lives of peace and quiet or whether they live and work in the tow-ers of power, prestige, and authority. The same rules apply to everyone. It is the greatness of this country, Mr. Speaker. It is the greatness, the ele-gance, the simplicity of a woman who is blindfolded holding nothing but a set of scales and a sword. The chief law enforcement official for this country is on the eve of being held in contempt of Congress because he re-fuses to follow the law. He refuses to allow Congress to find the truth, the whole truth. For those of you who want a negotiation, a compromise, an ex-traordinary accommodation, to use the Attorney General’s words, for those of you who want to plea bargain, my question to you is simply this: Will you settle for 75 percent of the truth? Is 50 percent of the truth enough for you? Is a third? Or do you want it all? Because if you want all the truth, then you want all the documents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4414 June 28, 2012 who has been murdered—and some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been there—it is a humbling, emo-tional, life-altering experience. All they want is the truth. They want an-swers. They want justice, and they don’t want part of it. They want all of it. And I will not compromise, Mr. Speaker, when it comes to finding the truth. Congress is right to pursue this no matter where it takes us. No matter which administration was in power and no matter what the facts are, we are right to pursue this. And we are wrong if we settle for anything less than all the facts. To my colleagues who are voting ‘‘no,’’ Mr. Speaker, let me ask this: Can you tell me, can you tell the American people why the Department of Justice approved this lethal, fatally flawed operation? To those of you who are voting ‘‘no,’’ can you tell the American people how the tactic of gunwalking was sanc-tioned? To those of you who are voting ‘‘no,’’ can you tell Brian Terry’s family and friends how a demonstrably false letter was written on Department of Justice letterhead on February 4, and where would we be if we accepted that letter at face value? A letter written on De-partment of Justice letterhead, that is not just another political Cabinet agency. It is emblematic of what we stand for as a country—truth, justice, the equal application of law to every-one. That letter was written on Amer-ica’s stationery. That is what the De-partment of Justice is, and it was dead wrong. And where would we be if we took their word for it? Our fellow citizens have a right to know the truth, and we have an obliga-tion to fight for it, Mr. Speaker, the politics be damned. We have a right to fight for it. I wish the Attorney General would give us the documents. I would rather have the documents than have this vote on contempt of Congress. But we cannot force him to do the right thing, and that does not relieve us of the re-sponsibility for us to do the right thing. Even if the heavens may fall, Mr. Speaker, I want the truth. I want all of it. We should never settle for less than all of it, and we have to start today. Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I op- posed the contempt of Congress resolution today because I don’t want political games or partisan politics to stand in the way of a seri-ous effort to find the truth. The best place to resolve this dispute isn’t on the floor of the House in an election year, but in a federal court where both sides can present their cases and the debate won’t turn into a political circus. I’ve been disappointed by the failure of both House Republicans and the Justice Depart-ment to find a practical way to get the Amer-ican people the full details of this tragedy with-out compromising existing court orders and other national security concerns. An American was murdered and we owe it to his family and the public to get to the bottom of what hap- pened. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I’ve been very disturbed to hear today that it’s in-appropriate for the National Rifle Association to take a position on this resolution. It should be clear to everyone that as a long-time NRA board member, I take a back seat to no one on Second Amendment issues. On this resolution, I can tell you that it is en-tirely appropriate for the NRA to take a posi-tion. We are here today because Congress has a duty to hold our government accountable. We have a duty to ensure those in charge protect the public and the Constitution. Con-gress was misled when Administration officials initially briefed the appropriate Congressional committees. The U.S. Attorney General’s of-fice denied knowledge of a gun walking oper-ation after whistleblowers reported troubling al-legations. However, they later admitted certain officials with the Attorney General’s office did have knowledge at the time Congress initially reviewed allegations of gun walking. I am deeply troubled by reports the ATF forced law abiding gun dealers to do some-thing they knew was wrong—to sell guns to in-dividuals they normally would not sell to. The Administration designed this outrageous pro-gram to reportedly reduce gun violence along our SW border. And an innocent American Border Patrol agent paid the ultimate price for this ill-conceived plan. There are those who believe that there were ulterior motives at play. We already know about at least three e-mails from ATF officials discussing how they could use information from ‘‘Fast and Furious’’ to make the case for a new gun control proposal—the Obama ad-ministration’s proposal to impose a new—and, I believe, illegal—reporting requirement on dealers who sell multiple long guns to individ-uals in the southwest border states. The ad-ministration has defended that rule in court, and by their logic there’s no reason it couldn’t be expanded to all guns in all states. That would be a system of national gun reg- istration. And that makes this a Second Amendment issue. We as elected lawmakers must have all rel- evant facts to hold whoever approved Oper-ation Fast and the Furious accountable. I stand with my colleagues here today who be-lieve that the Oversight Committee has been denied all relevant evidence on who approved this terrible operation. The Oversight Commit-tee’s investigation has been thorough. The committee has followed the evidence in pur-suit of the truth, not in pursuit of a political agenda. What brings us here today is the fact that this effort has been stonewalled by this Justice Department and this White House. The American people deserve to know the truth. The family of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry deserves to know the truth. Members of Con-gress deserve to know the truth. Today’s vote will bring us one step closer to learning the truth. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, it is unfor- tunate that the House must vote on whether to hold the Attorney General in contempt for re-fusing to produce documents in his Depart-ment. The underlying facts are disturbing and tragic, leading to the death of a Border Patrol officer and several hundred people in Mexico. The Attorney General should work with Con-gress to understand what went wrong rather than to withhold information and attempt to thwart the investigation. The power of Congress to investigate and conduct oversight of federal agencies has been well established throughout our history. The late claim of Executive Privilege made here, on the other hand, is not consistent with precedent or previous court rulings. One can only conclude that the Attorney General, per-haps on the instruction of the President, is try-ing to prevent Congress and the American people from learning the truth. Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, the resolution be- fore us today is an illegitimate, politically moti-vated smear campaign. Never in the history of the House has a U.S. Attorney General been held in contempt. What makes this resolution particularly outrageous is that there is absolutely no basis for it. The Attorney General has testified repeat- edly about Operation Fast & Furious. The Jus-tice Department has turned over thousands of pages of relevant records about this incident. None of that matters to the majority. Neither does the fact that these kinds of operations were undertaken by the Bush administration. And the majority does not want the public to know that not a single witness was allowed to testify before the House Oversight & Govern-ment Reform Committee about past ‘‘gun walking’’ episodes in the Bush administration. That’s why this resolution and the Oversight Committee’s ‘‘hearings’’ into Fast & Furious are not about ‘‘gun walking’’—they are about election year politics. Rather than dealing with the substantive issue of illegal guns and how to reduce violent gun-related crime, today we have a political stunt that does nothing to solve the problem that cost the life of a federal agent. Mr. Speak-er, the public see this for what it is: a politi-cally motivated legislative lynching—and those who support this illegitimate resolution will have to answer for it to the voters. Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong and unyielding opposition to resolution recommending that the House find Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress. This unprecedented resolution, which was passed out of committee on a party-line vote, is nothing more than an attempt by the major-ity Republican leadership to divert attention from its failure to address the real challenges facing our country. The hard working and hard pressed people of the 37th Congressional District of California did not send me here to waste precious floor time debating this frivolous and partisan reso- lution. They want us to work together to create jobs for the unemployed, make education af-fordable, health care available, and protect the social safety net of Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and assistance programs to vulner-able families. I oppose the resolution before us for several reasons: The resolution relates to a document re- quest involving allegations of ‘‘gunwalkng’’ in an ATF operation known as ‘‘Operation Fast and Furious,’’ but the documents now involved are completely unrelated to how ‘‘gunwalking’’ was utilized in the operation. Over the past year, the Justice Depart- ment provided thousands of pages of respon-sive documents to the Oversight and Govern-ment Reform Committee and has made doz-ens of officials available for interviews and hearings, and the Attorney General has testi-fied before Congress nine times on this topic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4415 June 28, 2012 The Committee’s investigation identified no evidence that the Attorney General or sen-ior Department officials were aware of gunwalking in Fast and Furious. To the con-trary, as soon as the Attorney General be-came aware of the tactic, he put a halt to it, ordered an IG investigation, and instituted in-ternal reform measures. The House of Representatives has never held an Attorney General in contempt. The only precedent cited in the Issa contempt res-olution is a committee contempt vote that took place in the 1990’s against former Attorney General Janet Reno. That action was so wide-ly discredited that Speaker Gingrich chose not to bring it to the floor for a vote. During this investigation, the Committee refused every Democratic request for a hear-ing witness, including the head of ATF—the agency that actually ran the operation. This is not the way to conduct an oversight investiga-tion unless you are interested in partisan polit-ical ploys instead of learning the facts. Mr. Speaker, I must say that am offended that Attorney General Holder, a man of unim-peachable integrity and one who has served this nation with distinction for many years, has been subjected to such demeaning treatment by some in the majority. Even though Attorney General Holder has been forthright and forth-coming, some in this body accuse him of a cover-up or claim he has been obstructive. He has even been called a ‘‘liar’’ on national tele-vision. These unfounded charges are beyond the pale and reflect more on those who have uttered them that they do our Attorney Gen-eral, the honorable Eric Holder. I oppose this politically inspired resolution and urge my colleagues to join me. Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ex- press my opposition to the majority’s decision to force a contempt vote on the floor. I want to mention the following points for the record. There is no evidence that the attorney gen- eral authorized, condones, or knew about ‘‘gun walking.’’ Chairman D ARRELL ISSAadmit- ted this yesterday before the Rules Com-mittee. There is no evidence that the attorney gen- eral lied to Congress or engaged in a cover- up. Chairman I SSA also admitted this yester- day. There is no evidence that the White House had anything to do with ‘‘gun walking’’ oper-ations. Chairman I SSA admitted this on Fox News on Sunday. Democrats wanted a real investigation, but Chairman I SSArefused TEN different requests from Democrats for a hearing with Ken Melson, the former Director of ATF—the agen-cy in charge. Chairman I SSA said this yesterday about ‘‘gun walking’’ operations under the Bush Ad-ministration: ‘‘They were all flops. They were all failures.’’ Yet, he has refused all Demo-cratic requests to interview Bush Administra-tion officials about their rules. Despite finding no evidence that Attorney General Holder knew about ‘‘gun walking’’, the Committee has obtained documentary evi-dence showing that former Attorney General Mukasey was personally briefed on botched interdiction efforts during the Bush Administra-tion and he was told that they would be ex-panded during his tenure. Chairman I SSAhas refused to call on Mukasey for a hearing. Republicans have not granted a single Democratic witness request during the entire 16 month so-called investigation. This has been a credible process. As soon as Attorney General Holder learned about ‘‘gun walking’’, he immediately halted it and ordered an IG investigation. In closing Mr. Speaker, I think the worst part is that the tragic death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent is being politicized and used as a way to score cheap political points. This is espe-cially disappointing to me. As a former Border Patrol Agent and Sector Chief with 26 1⁄2years of law enforcement experience on the U.S.- Mexico Border, I expect that this body show more respect and more focus. Instead of using this tragedy as a political ploy, this body needs to see this as a learning opportunity and a wake-up call. We must take action and provide ATF with the needed re-sources and tools it needs to tackle the issue of gun trafficking. I hope that this Congress is able to move on to enact the critical reforms needed to more effectively combat this threat—-and I will gladly work with my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle on that par-ticular effort. Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose H. Res 708, ‘‘Resolution recommending that the House of Representa-tives find Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with a sub-poena duly issued by the Committee on Over-sight and Government Reform.’’ Holding a sitting Attorney General in con- tempt would be unprecedented. In our Na-tion’s history the House of Representatives has never held a sitting Attorney General in contempt of Congress. In 1998, the then Chair of the House Over- sight Committee led a vote to hold then Attor-ney General Janet Reno in contempt of Con- gress. Attorney General Reno was also accused of withholding documents; however, the then Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich elected not to bring the Contempt Citation to the Floor. Attorney General Reno and House leadership were able to resolve their difference without holding our Nation’s highest law enforcement officer in contempt. Today’s conflict can also be resolved without holding Attorney General Holder in contempt. I firmly believe and I am joined by at least 65 other colleagues who believe that the Attor-ney General is acting in good faith based upon his actions over the course of the past 15 months. The Attorney General has testified before Congress no less than nine times in the last 15 months and has made himself available for meetings with Members of Congress. Further, the Department of Justice has cooperated with Congressional inquiries into this matter and is willing to continue to engage in discussions with Congressional leadership and others. As of today, the Attorney General has pro- duced more than 7,600 pages of documents as part of 47 separate productions, including sensitive law enforcement materials related to the pending prosecution of the defendants in the underlying Fast and Furious case. Attorney General Holder has consistently expressed his willingness to find a resolution to the issues surrounding the narrow list of documents for which he is being cited. Holding the Nation’s top law-enforcement of- ficer in contempt of Congress would be a drastic, disproportionate action on the part of this body. A contempt citation should be an act of last resort, after lengthy preliminary procedures, negotiations, gathering of evidence through other methods, appeals to potential intercessors and intermediaries. Contempt Citations have been extraor- dinarily rare which is evidenced by the fact that the House has declared just four people in contempt over the last three decades. For these reasons and more we request that you elect not to bring the Contempt Citation to the Floor this Thursday. Mr. Speaker, I delivered a letter to you that was signed by 65 Members of this body stat-ing the same, that this destructive piece of legislation should not be brought to the Floor today. It appears that this is nothing more than destructive election-year politics pure and sim-ple. It is Republicans following through on their threats to use their authority to try to damage this Administration, politically, and this Attorney General, specifically, who has placed an emphasis on enforcing civil rights, voting rights and defending our justice system and the rule of law. This kind of divisive politics hurts Americans who want their leaders focused on fixing real problems they face every day and hurts law enforcement agents who are putting their lives at risk in ongoing investigations that could be compromised by the Committee’s political fish-ing expedition. Congress has the answers to its questions about who designed this flawed operation and who authorized it—they just don’t like it so they have ignored the evidence they received last year which shows this was a tactic that was designed and employed in the field and it dates back to the previous Administration. This Attorney General is the one who put a stop to the tactic, called for an independent in-vestigation and instituted reforms and per-sonnel changes to ensure it doesn’t happen again. The Department has made extraordinary ef- forts to accommodate Congress by turning over almost 8,000 documents—including all the documents that relate to the tactics in this flawed investigation and the other flawed in-vestigations that occurred in Arizona in the previous administration. The Department has even turned over inter- nal deliberative material to answer the Com-mittee’s questions and the AG offered to pro-vide additional deliberative documentation to resolve the subpoena, but the Committee re-jected that offer. The documents at issue now are after-the- fact—they have nothing to do with the flawed tactics in any of the investigations dating back to the Bush Administration or who designed, approved or employed them. The resolution relates to a document re- quest involving allegations of ‘‘gunwalking’’ in an ATF operation known as ‘‘Operation Fast and Furious,’’ which came to light when two weapons involved in the operation were recov-ered at the murder scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. However, the documents now at issue are completely unrelated to how ‘‘gunwalking’’ there is a question about whether gun-waling existed was utilized in the operation. Over the past year, the Justice Department has pro-vided thousands of pages of documents to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and has made dozens of officials available for interviews and hearings, and the Attorney VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00257 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4416 June 28, 2012 General has testified before Congress nine times on this topic. The evidence dem-onstrated that Fast and Furious was in fact the fourth in a series of gunwalking operations run out of the ATF field division in Phoenix over a span of five years beginning in 2006 during the Bush Administration. The investigation identified no evidence that the Attorney General or senior Department of-ficials were aware of gunwalking in Fast and Furious. To the contrary, as soon as the Attor-ney General became aware of the tactic, he put a halt to it, ordered an IG investigation, and instituted internal reform measures. The House of Representatives has never held an Attorney General in contempt. The only precedent cited in the Issa contempt res-olution is a committee contempt vote that took place in the 1990’s held by then-Chairman Dan Burton against former Attorney General Janet Reno. That action became so widely discredited that Speaker Gingrich chose not to bring it to the Floor for a vote. The current contempt debate no longer fo- cuses on any documents relating to how gunwalking was initiated and utilized in Oper-ation Fast and Furious. Since Republicans could identify no wrongdoing by the Attorney General, the Committee shifted just last week to focus exclusively on a single letter sent by the Department’s Office of Legislative Affairs to Senator C HARLES GRASSLEY on February 4, 2011, initially denying allegations of gunwalking. The Department has already ac-knowledged that its letter was inaccurate, has withdrawn the letter, and has provided the Committee with more than 1,300 pages of documents relating to how it was drafted. These documents show that Department staffers who drafted the letter did not inten-tionally mislead Congress, but instead relied on inaccurate assurances from ATF leaders and officials in Arizona who ran the operation. Despite these good faith efforts, House Re-publicans chose to move forward with a con-tempt resolution anyway. Moving the goalposts again, the Committee is now demanding additional internal delibera-tive documents created even after the Grass-ley letter was sent. The Attorney General of-fered to provide them last week in exchange for a good faith commitment to move toward resolution of the contempt fight, but Chairman Issa flatly refused. When it became clear that contempt was inevitable, the Administration asserted executive privilege over this narrow category of deliberative Department docu-ments, while indicating at the same time that it remains willing to continue negotiations. The Issa contempt resolution is nothing more than a politically motivated, election-year ploy. During this investigation, the Committee refused every Democratic request for a hear-ing witness, including the head of ATF—the agency that actually ran the operation. Chairman I SSAhas acknowledged that ‘‘we do go down blind alleys regularly’’ and has made numerous unfounded claims, including accusing the FBI agents of concealing a ‘‘third gun’’ from the scene of Agent Terry’s mur-der—a claim that the FBI quickly dem-onstrated to be completely unfounded. Ms. M CCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, today the House is voting on a Republican-Tea Party witch hunt intended to destroy an honorable man’s character. This resolution of contempt targeting Attorney General Eric Holder is a shameful and shameless abuse of power by the majority party. The only reason this un- precedented attack is taking place on the House floor today, against our country’s first African American Attorney General, is be-cause the Tea Party Republican majority is pandering to birthers, NRA members and other extremist obsessed with defeating Presi-dent Obama. Attorney General Eric Holder has my full support and I reject this transparent political abuse of power. I am strongly opposed to the House Repub- lican resolution to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents pertaining to sensitive and on-going law enforcement activities to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The committee request is for documents re- lated to Operation Fast and Furious, con-ducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), which al-lowed the straw purchase of firearms in pur-suit of prosecutions of gun smugglers. Two of the illegally purchased AK–47 assault weap-ons were found at the scene of a gun battle that resulted in the killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry on December 15, 2010. In his effort to cooperate with Chairman D ARRELL ISSA, Attorney General Holder has provided the Oversight Committee with more than 7,600 pages of documents and participated in nine congressional hearings. In 2006, under the Bush Administration, the ATF’s Arizona office used the tactic of ‘‘gun walking’’ to allow guns to remain on the street after a potentially illegal sale to build a bigger case rather than interdicting them immediately. President Bush’s attorney general, Michael Mukasey, received a briefing paper on No-vember 16, 2007 on ATF cooperation with Mexico on ‘‘controlled deliveries’’ of weapons smuggling. The House Oversight Committee has failed to call any Bush Administration offi-cials to testify on this matter. This week, in Politico, a senior Republican House aide is quoted as saying, ‘‘The con-tempt of Holder is a dog whistle to the right- wing tea party community, saying that we are representing them . . . this is a way to say we’re going after this administration, holding them accountable.’’ Further proof of the blatantly political nature of the Holder contempt vote is the decision by the National Rifle Association (NRA) to ‘‘score’’ the vote as part of their legislative re-port card to their membership. The NRA has long championed allowing the proliferation of assault weapons previously banned on Amer-ican streets and sold over the counter, like the AK–47s found at Agent Terry’s murder scene. This entire episode is a stain on the reputa- tion of this Republican led House of Rep-resentatives. It is appalling to know that the politics of personal destruction is the top policy priority of this Tea Party controlled House. Again, I want to state my strong support for Attorney General Holder and the Obama Ad-ministration’s efforts to cooperate with this on- going congressional investigation. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4418 June 28, 2012 AUTHORIZING COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM TO INITIATE OR INTER-VENE IN JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS TO ENFORCE CERTAIN SUB-POENAS Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 708, I call up the res-olution (H. Res. 706) authorizing the Committee on Oversight and Govern-ment Reform to initiate or intervene in judicial proceedings to enforce certain subpoenas. The Clerk read the title of the resolu- tion. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. B ASSof New Hampshire). Pursuant to House Resolution 708, the resolution is considered read. The text of the resolution is as fol- lows: H. R ES. 706 Resolved, That the Chairman of the Com- mittee on Oversight and Government Reform is authorized to initiate or intervene in judi-cial proceedings in any Federal court of com-petent jurisdiction, on behalf of the Com-mittee on Oversight and Government Re-form, to seek declaratory judgments affirm-ing the duty of Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, to com-ply with any subpoena that is a subject of the resolution accompanying House Report 112–546 issued to him by the Committee as part of its investigation into the United States Department of Justice operation known as ‘‘Fast and Furious’’ and related matters, and to seek appropriate ancillary relief, including injunctive relief. S EC. 2. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform shall report as soon as practicable to the House with respect to any judicial proceedings which it initiates or in which it intervenes pursuant to this resolu-tion. S EC. 3. The Office of General Counsel of the House of Representatives shall, at the au-thorization of the Speaker, represent the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in any litigation pursuant to this resolution. In giving that authorization, the Speaker shall consult with the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group established pursuant to clause 8 of rule II. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from California (Mr. I SSA) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. C UMMINGS ) each will control 10 min- utes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 min- utes to the gentleman from California (Mr. L UNGREN ). Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. Mr. Speaker, we’ve just had a very important vote and some would ask what this second vote is about. This second vote is a simple author- ization for the committee involved to be able to essentially hire counsel that would allow us to go into court to seek a declaratory judgment by the Federal court to enforce the subpoenas that have been presented by this committee to the Attorney General of the United States. It’s a simple, straightforward resolution. Why is it important? One of our obli- gations under the Constitution is to provide oversight of the executive branch. There are those in this body who have been here and engaged in de-bate with respect to important items such as the PATRIOT Act and FISA. One of the things that we’ve attempted to assure our constituents was that we would ensure that the constitutional rights of Americans would not be tram-pled upon as we carry out the appro-priate responsibility of protecting this country and our constituents against terrorist attack. That requires us to provide active oversight over the exec-utive branch. Similarly, in this case, we have an obligation to stand in the shoes of those we represent, to oversee the oper-ations of the executive branch—in this case, the Department of Justice—to en-sure that they are following the law. b1650 One manner in which that can be frustrated is by a department—in this case, the Department of Justice—that refuses to respond to lawful subpoenas and give us the information so that we can do that oversight. That is what we were talking about. This Congress, this House of Rep- resentatives, was misled. I don’t know whether it was intentional or not. I do know we were misled by a representa-tion from the Justice Department in an official response to an inquiry by the Congress of the United States. That was not corrected for 10 months. You can look at it a couple of ways. One is that there was an attempt to slow-walk the Congress so that it could not carry out its constitutional respon-sibility. There is a lot of talk on this floor by both Democrats and Repub-licans as to how we have an obligation to oversee the executive branch. In fact, one of the genius points of our Founding Fathers’ Constitution is that conflict between or among the three branches of government, that natural tension. But that natural tension can-not exist and we cannot do that which we are called upon under the Constitu-tion to do faithfully if we are denied in-formation to oversee the operations of the Department of Justice. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ISSA. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali- fornia. So all we are doing simply is asking for the authorization so that this committee can have the represen-tation of counsel to see that these sub-poenas are carried out. Since we have been given every sense from the Jus-tice Department that it would be folly, in a sense, to suggest that they would carry out the actions that we just voted upon against the Attorney Gen-eral, this is the method by which we can achieve that which we are required to do; that is, to carry out oversight re-sponsibility against the executive de-partment, including the Department of Justice. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from the District of Co-lumbia (Ms. N ORTON ). Ms. NORTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I have come back from walking out of this proceeding to address the seri-ous, baseless charge of a coverup. No one in the majority has been able to charge that the Attorney General or his top lieutenants knew about the gunwalking initiated in the Bush ad-ministration because there is no evi-dence of that after 16 months of inves-tigation. This contempt resolution stems from a letter from the Justice Department correcting the record resulting from a prior letter written in the Legislative Affairs section of the Justice Depart-ment that there was no gunwalking. That letter relied on statements of ATF officials and Justice Department officials who this Justice Department then fired and did its own investiga-tion. So what you have is contempt for correcting the record. What the Justice Department did was the opposite of a coverup. But it is al-leged that if the Department has noth-ing to hide, it would simply turn over everything in its possession. The other side has gone so far as to say that when the President invoked executive privi-lege, he too was implicated in a cover-up. But the Supreme Court itself has said that while the privilege is not ab-solute—and here I am quoting—human experience teaches us that those who expect public dissemination of their re-marks may well temper candor with concerns for appearances. Thus, Presi-dents have repeatedly asserted execu-tive privilege to protect confidential executive branch deliberative mate-rials from congressional subpoena. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield the gentle- lady 30 additional seconds. Ms. NORTON. The last leg of today’s weak reed of contempt is the claim that the President asserted executive privilege too late. Why not from the beginning? The President, like every President before him, did not assert the privilege until negotiations broke down. But the committee proceeded without even ex-amining the basis for the privilege, as prior Chairs of our committee have done. A coverup is the most irrespon-sible allegation of this debate because no evidence of a coverup has been sub-mitted. This subpoena is so partisan and po- litical that I expect any court to do just what our committee should have done—compel the parties to sit down and negotiate. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, it’s amazing that people would say there’s no evi-dence of a coverup when somebody says, No, we didn’t do what we did, and then hides it for an additional 10 months. By any normal American standard, that would be a coverup. With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. F ARENTHOLD ). Mr. FARENTHOLD. I thank the chair for yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4419 June 28, 2012 I rise today in support of the motion for civil contempt so we can get an at-torney to proceed. Normally under contempt, what hap- pens is, we vote, like we just did, to hold someone in contempt, and it’s turned over to the Department of Jus-tice—in fact, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia—to pursue in dis-trict court. Unfortunately, the U.S. at-torney is an employee and reports to the Attorney General, who was just found in contempt. And I am concerned that past history of stonewalling delays that are associated with getting us information and cooperating with us on Fast and Furious will continue and, in fact, there will be no prosecution of the contempt resolution we just voted out. So it is absolutely critical that the committee be given the authority to pursue this on their own if the Jus-tice Department is not responsive. I, therefore, urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this civil con-tempt resolution. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. S COTT). Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. The contempt citation pending against Attorney General Holder is un-founded, unfair, and unwise. All of this involves questions about gunwalking. And we know that the Attorney Gen-eral has handed over thousands of doc-uments in response to multiple sub-poenas. So we know that the gunwalking policy began under the Bush administration. We know that President Bush’s Attorney General, Mi-chael Mukasey, was briefed on the pol-icy, and it continued. We know that when Attorney General Holder found out about it, he shut the program down and called for an investigation. If we want to know why the policy started, we should ask officials who served when it started during the Bush administration. If we want to know what Attorney General Holder knew about Fast and Furious, we should call the former Acting Director of the ATF, Ken Melson, who is on the record as saying that he would have been the one to have informed the Attorney Gen-eral, but even he didn’t know about Fast and Furious. But unfortunately, requests from the Democratic members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to call these witnesses have been rejected. At this point, there has been no ar- ticulation of any useful information about the origins of gunwalking in Fast and Furious or the death of Agent Brian Terry that can be learned from the narrow set of documents still at issue, nor has there been any articula-tion of any legitimate legislative pur-pose that can be achieved. And, in fact, Chairman I SSA has silenced whistle- blowers who testified about legislation to strengthen law enforcement tools on our southwestern boarder. If the Speaker now insists on holding Attorney General Holder in contempt for failing to respond to more sub- poenas, the Speaker should articulate with clarity what general purpose will be served by the response. If nothing legitimately useful is to be learned nor any legislative purpose is to be achieved with continued responses to these subpoenas, then it is time for the Attorney General to get back to work, along with the Members of the House. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I’m not sure if I heard the gentleman right when he said that I ‘‘silenced whistleblowers’’ in order to keep them from talking about gun control. Is the gentleman disparaging and falsely claiming that I did something that I know for a fact I did not? Mr. CUMMINGS. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. ISSA. Of course. Mr. CUMMINGS. I will tell you what you did. When you called the whistle-blowers in, and the whistleblowers, who are ATF agents, and you know this— Mr. ISSA. Reclaiming my time, it’s pretty clear you are disparaging me, and you are disparaging me by making a claim that’s untrue. The bottom line is, in committee, witnesses were told that they need not answer questions that were not the subject of the hearing and, in fact, those witnesses were allowed and did answer questions by the minority hav-ing to do with gun control, an issue they prefer to talk about rather than the cause of Brian Terry’s death. With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. M CCAUL). b1700 Mr. M CCAUL. Mr. Speaker, as a former Federal prosecutor at the De-partment of Justice, I do not take these proceedings lightly. Above all, those at the Department cherish their integrity. Mr. Speaker, that integrity has now been impugned. This is not about politics. It’s about pursuit of the truth and justice. The definition of contempt is the willful disobedience to or open disrespect for the rules or orders of a court or legisla-tive body. This definition falls squarely within the facts here. When insiders revealed the govern- ment’s role in Operation Fast and Furi-ous, the Department of Justice falsely told Congress that whistleblowers weren’t telling the truth. As Congress fulfilled its oversight obligations and tried to get to the bottom of how guns were put in the hands of Mexican drug cartels, ultimately killing Border Pa-trol Brian Terry, this administration refused to turn over crucial documents that would shed light on this. Instead, they asserted executive privilege at the eleventh hour, calling into question the validity of the privilege itself and at the same time demonstrating that communications were held at the high-est levels in the government. In fact, the wiretaps, we all know, are approved at Main Justice. Mr. Speaker, this Attorney General needs to be held accountable. The Terry family, the families of the Mexi- can people who have been slain, and the American people deserve no less. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. R EYES ). Mr. REYES. It is indeed a sad day today. As an officer that spent 261⁄2 years wearing the United States Border Patrol uniform, it is regrettable for me today that we’re here under these cir-cumstances. I want to acknowledge and thank the chairman and the ranking member for inviting me to go with them to Mexico City and visit at the U.S. Embassy about the circumstances around what led to the investigation of Fast and Fu-rious. And to me, it’s regrettable be-cause we are here discussing the death of a Border Patrol agent. I went to the memorial service for Agent Brian Terry. I visited with his mom and his family that day. I went there because as a former Border Patrol agent I wanted to express sympathy and sup-port, as I did so many times as a chief for agents that were killed in the line of duty. So for me, it is particularly troubling that we’re here politicizing the death of a United States Border Patrol agent. We ought to be about getting to the circumstances of the investigation led under a U.S. Attorney under OCDETF. Both the ranking member and the chairman know that that was the con-trolling entity in this case. I don’t know except to say that it’s pure basic politics that we’ve now spun this up to the level of the Attorney General. Having had the experience to supervise my agents that were part of OCDETF investigations and having had a number of conversations with my friends on the other side of the aisle who were experienced prosecutors, ev-erybody here that has that experience knows that those controls don’t go up to the level of the Attorney General. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield the gen- tleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. REYES. So we’re here taking a lot of time when we should be dis-cussing things that are a priority to the American people. We’re here under the worst of circumstances for the Terry family, which all they want is closure on the death of a son, on the death of a patriotic American citizen, and spinning it in a political sense. I really think that this is a sad day for this House of Representatives, and we ought to do better for the American people. Mr. ISSA. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. L ABRADOR ). Mr. LABRADOR. Mr. Speaker, once again I sit here and I’m amazed by the language that is being used. We’ve had numerous hearings. We’ve had numer-ous investigations. We’ve had a lot of people come before Congress and give us false information. And the reality is that I hear again and again from the other side that there is no evidence of coverup; there is no evidence of cover-up.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4420 June 28, 2012 But the reality is that we have only received 5 percent of the documents that we have requested. There is no way for us to know exactly what hap-pened, who knew, and what did they know, unless we receive all of the docu-ments. All we’re asking the Attorney General to do is to provide the docu-ments that we have requested. We wouldn’t be standing here holding these contempt proceedings if he had given us the documents. And that’s why I ask everybody in this body to ac-tually vote for contempt. Mr. CUMMINGS. May I inquire as to how much time is left. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from Maryland has 3 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from California has 1 3⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. CUMMINGS. I reserve the bal- ance of my time. Mr. ISSA. Reserving the right to close, I have no further requests for time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, it’s in- teresting here today, what we just did with regard to the criminal contempt. I do believe that it is very unfortunate, and let me tell you why. We have an Attorney General who is indeed an honorable man. We who practice law look up to the Attorney General and any U.S. Attorney. They are folks like us who are well educated and who love their country. And Eric Holder, Jr., is no exception. Over and over again, he has tried to cooperate with this committee. And I’m sure that both sides—his side and our side—have become a little frus-trated at times. But as he said in a meeting a couple of weeks ago, he said that he’s willing to give the docu-ments, but he was asking that at some point his attorneys have an oppor-tunity to get back to work. Now, Leader P ELOSI said something a moment ago that we should not lose sight of, Mr. Speaker, when she spoke about the Constitution and that it re-quires Congress and the executive branch to avoid unnecessary conflicts and to seek accommodations that serve both of their interests. In the words of Attorney General William French Smith, under President Reagan: It is the obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to acknowledge and, if possible, to meet the legitimate needs of the other branch. I believe that this Attorney General has bent over backwards trying to ac-commodate us, trying to provide the information, but at the same time, as he has said to us many times, to pro-tect the institution of the Attorney General of the United States. And when I say protect the institution, I mean protect the institution, the same types of things that have assertions of executive privilege, making sure that wiretap applications are not made pub-lic, making sure that confidential in-formants are not disclosed, making sure that ongoing investigations are not interfered with. And I’m not sure, but there may be something that happened—we’re not sure; we’re checking on it—happened in this House already today, something that may have interfered with the trial already. So as I close, I would submit that he has done the very best that he could, and now we need to meet him halfway. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from California is recognized for 1 3⁄4minutes. Mr. ISSA. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s been a long day for America, but it’s been a longer day for the Terry family. I’m going to urge everyone to vote for the ability to hire counsel, and that’s what the last vote is, and I be-lieve it will pass overwhelmingly. But I’m going to use this time to pledge to the America people, to pledge to the Terry family, and to pledge to my colleagues: this investigation has in fact been brought to a halt in one area—and the area is the Attorney General’s flat refusal to any longer co-operate with this committee. b1710 But it doesn’t change the fact that in the days and weeks to come, we will use what we can in the way of other tools, including some of the individuals that the minority has talked about today, to glean additional information, to find ways to prove accountability for the many people that had to be in-volved in this OCDETF operation in order for those guns to walk. We will continue to do that. We will try to find the truth. Hopefully in the weeks to come, we also will begin getting cooperation from the administration again. But if we don’t, I will tell the ranking mem-ber here today, it has always been my intention to look backwards to pre-vious gunwalking programs that we be-lieve were certainly poorly designed and resulted in weapons getting out of the hands of lawful people and into the hands of criminal elements. That’s not going to change. It’s not going to change because it’s our obligation to investigate and because this one we cannot let loose until the Terry family has been kept a promise that the rank-ing member and I both made. So I take the ranking member at his word today that, in fact, he will not rest until we get some answers, and I commit the same that I will not, and I urge the passage of this resolution. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 708, the previous question is ordered on the resolution.

Throughout my life’s history, al- though we have traveled mountains and low valleys, I have been equal and unequal in this Nation. Yet today I feel as tall as the pine trees because our Supreme Court shed itself of diverse and sometimes divisive bickering and upheld the Constitution of the United States. It granted to the American people af- fordable health care. It granted to the sickest of the sick the opportunity to be covered by insurance. It granted to seniors who fall into doughnut holes and who have to choose prescription drugs over food a relief line. It granted to hospitals that take in indigent pa-tients who may otherwise die on side-walks in America an opportunity to take care of those patients. It gave children with preexisting diseases an opportunity to live fully in this coun-try. So now the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. We have been vindi-cated. Every single, single vote of those Members who have lost and of those who have won, we’ve been vindi-cated. Thank God for the United States Supreme Court. ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will entertain Special Order speeches without prejudice to the re-sumption of legislative business. f THE PROGRESSIVE MESSAGE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 5, 2011, the gentleman from Min-nesota (Mr. E LLISON ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the mi-nority leader. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, my name is K EITH ELLISON , and I claim this Spe- cial Order time on behalf of the Pro-gressive Caucus. I am very pleased to be joined by my dear friend from the great State of Ohio, Mr. D ENNIS KUCI- NICH. The Progressive Caucus has a Web site we refer people to, which is cpc.grijalva.house.gov. I urge every-body to check it out because it has a lot of excellent information. This we call The Progressive Mes- sage. Today, we are going to focus on three topics, Mr. Speaker. They will be in the areas of: (1) historic health care; (2) the travesty of justice perpetuated on Eric Holder; (3) the voter ID issue that is proliferating across the coun-try, that of trying to restrict and sup-press the votes of Americans. So that’s our Progressive Message for today. I want to introduce the first subject by saying that today was a historic day. The historic health care bill was passed many, many months ago; but until the Supreme Court of the United States said that this bill was constitu-tional, that this act was constitu-tional, it was always in jeopardy of being overturned. In the Progressive Caucus, many of us were signatories and cosponsors of H.R. 676, which is the single-payer bill—or health care for all and Medicare for all. Personally, I think today is a dra- matic step forward in the quest to make sure that all Americans are cov-ered and can go to a doctor. This is a very important step—it’s an advance— so I’m happy to see it. With that, I would like to just turn some time over to the gentleman from Ohio for any comments he may care to make about the health care bill or about the Supreme Court decision. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. KUCINICH. I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota, Congress-man E LLISON , for his leadership in the Progressive Caucus and to thank him for yielding me some time to talk about this momentous decision by the Supreme Court. First of all, a little bit of context. I represent Cleveland, Ohio. There are many people in Cleveland who are uninsured. There are many people in Cleveland who could not afford health care. There are many people who are working who can’t get their families covered. This issue of health care reform is one of the defining issues in our coun-try, and it’s one that we finally grap-pled with in 2010 to come up with a bill that not everyone agreed with. As a matter of fact, as Mr. E LLISON will re- member, I didn’t agree with this. I was not satisfied with health care reform within the context of a for-profit sys-tem because I wanted a not-for-profit system. Yet, while we had a for-profit system, one of the things we needed to do was to make sure children with pre-existing conditions would be covered; to make sure all of these lifetime caps on the amount of money that people could claim for expenses were removed; and to make sure that people were given a fighting chance with the insur-ance companies. b1750 What’s happened is the Affordable Care Act finally took a step in the di-rection of reform. It’s an important step, and the Supreme Court has said you can do that under Congress’ taxing authority, but it’s just a step. All of us understand that there are still millions of Americans who are finding health care out of reach, even with the help that the Affordable Care Act offers. That’s why at the State level there are still States, such as Vermont, that are looking at how they can go forward with a single-payer plan within their State. Mr. ELLISON. Let me just ask the gentleman a question. You had an amendment that we were trying to move onto the Affordable Care Act which would allow States, if they chose to, to pursue alternatives like a single-payer system. Do you recall your amendment? Mr. KUCINICH. Keep in mind that the Employee Retirement Income Se-curity Act essentially would stop States from going forward, so we asked basically for a waiver of that. The amendment would have provided for a waiver so States would have no legal bar to pursue a single-payer system. That was essentially passed in com-mittee and then stripped out. The point is we can enable it. Con- gress can facilitate that. The passage of affordable care, plus the Supreme Court saying Congress can move on health care, Congress can take a step, finally puts us in a position where we can elevate health care to the highest level of public concern. Every American who is out there to- night who’s worried about whether they would be able to get access to af-fordable health care suddenly realizes that it is possible. For those poor peo-ple across America who are wondering whether they are going to be shut out by one aspect of the Supreme Court de-cision, now it’s up to the States to re-affirm the position of the State in the life of their citizens by saying, if you’re a poor person, we’re not going to use the Supreme Court decision to block you from having access to the re-sources of the government with respect to health care.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4423 June 28, 2012 I think that we need to recognize that we’ve taken a big step here. As someone who wasn’t sure at first, as someone who, in a sense, reluctantly voted for the Affordable Care Act on the hope that by proving we could have reform within the context of a for-prof-it system, that it would open the door for further reforms, I’d say this is a great day. It shows that it’s possible to reform that for-profit system. I’m hopeful, as we’re celebrating today, that we look down the road to what we’re going to do in the future, which is to restart our efforts here, re-start the effort for a single-payer sys-tem, knowing at least that we have the assurance that more people are cov-ered, that you don’t have to worry about your child 26 and under, whether they are going to be covered under the policy, that you don’t have to worry about a child with a preexisting condi-tion, that you don’t have to worry about long-term caps, that you don’t have to worry about if you’re a senior where that doughnut hole is going to cause your budget to get crushed. What you have now is the government finally taking the side of the people and put-ting us in a position where we now are able, with integrity and with drive, to move towards the future where some-day we’re going to keep working for that single-payer system. Mr. ELLISON. I don’t know if this happened to you today, but it did hap-pen to me. I started thinking about all the door knocking that I did and think-ing about the health care horror sto-ries that I heard. I just want to ask you today, when you reflect on 57 percent of the people filing for bankruptcy being motivated by medical debt, when you hear about people getting a lifetime cap and not being able to get any additional health care, even when they’ve got cancer or if they’ve got cancer, then they get dropped. Mr. KUCINICH. The gentleman is right. The gentleman is correct. When you think of how many people—most bankruptcies, they’re connected to peo-ple not being able to pay hospital bills. Any single family has known the dread of having one individual get ill in the family, and everything people worked a lifetime for, they lose. Mr. ELLISON. The gentleman might reflect on the fact that many of these people you’re referring to have insur-ance, and I yield to the gentleman. Mr. KUCINICH. Oh, that’s right. Think about this now. You can have insurance, and if you run up against lifetime caps on coverage, you’re out of luck. So many Americans have gotten in trouble financially because, even though they have insurance, they can’t pay the bills. The bills have sent Amer-icans into poverty. We need to realize that we’ve taken a step in the direction of a substantial support for the American people and their health care with the Affordable Care Act, but it’s not the final step. Again, I am here to share with you, Mr. Speaker, my willingness to con-tinue the effort towards a universal single-payer, not-for-profit health care. You know what? Now that we’ve proven that reform of health care is possible, now that we have proven that health care is no longer the third rail of American politics, now that we have proven that the Court will uphold an effort by the Congress to move towards health care reform, well, now that we’ve proven that, we can say it is pos-sible to go to a place where we can have health care for all under a not- for-profit system. I thank the gentleman for his leader- ship, and I look forward to working with you as we chart a new course in America for health care for all. Thank you. Mr. ELLISON. Thank you. And to the gentleman from Ohio, who I know has some things to do, I just want to say that when the final chap-ter is written on the improvement and the advance in health care in America, there will certainly be chapters on how D ENNIS KUCINICH , through your leader- ship as a Member of the House of Rep-resentatives bill that you introduced through your Presidential run, where you really made health care a front- burner issue, you will have a chapter that will designate your great con-tributions to the American people to get quality, affordable, universal health care. So I do thank you today, sir, because I can tell you that today is somewhat of a reflection. You should think about how your campaign for President and other work you have done really did move the ball down the track. So I thank you, and I honor you for it. Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gen- tleman. Thank you very much. Mr. ELLISON. We’re joined by my good friend, J OHN GARAMENDI from California. Congressman G ARAMENDI , on a day like this, you must be full of thoughts about health care reform, the big lift, and all of the things that occurred. What are some of the thoughts that occur to you today, Congressman? Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you, Mr. E LLISON . Thank you so very much for your consistent and strong voice on what we really need to do here in America to take care of people. At the beginning of the day and at the end of the day, our task is to fulfill that message of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This day really, in many ways, fulfills that. Think about it. Can you have life without health care? Well, probably not for very long. Most everybody I know has had a sickness at one point or another. If you don’t get health care, you may very well lose your life. Happiness? We know that most of the bankruptcies—this is before the great crash—are a direct result of health care and not having sufficient insur-ance or not having insurance. With re-gard to happiness, wow. Of course, liberty. You just think about the number of Americans that are literally chained or tied to their job because they have health care there. If they want to leave, if they want to pursue a different course, they want to improve, they can’t, because they are tied to their job because of health care. They can’t get it. Today, the Supreme Court said that what this House did with the Afford-able Health Care Act is constitutional. It is constitutional. It is possible for us. As we just heard from Mr. K UCINICH , it is possible for us to reform the health care system. My thoughts are so happy for Amer- ica, so happy for that man that I saw 5 years ago that was on his deathbed, and he said, If I can just live another 5 months, I’ll be on Medicare and I can get the treatments that I need without bankrupting my family. Today he prob-ably will be able to get that. It’s a good day. b1800 I was the insurance commissioner for 8 years in California. And if only I had this law, if only this law were in place, I could have hammered those insurance companies that were discriminating against people who had preexisting conditions. But I didn’t have this law. So they were able to get away with dis-criminating against women because they are women. Because they are of child-bearing age, they may have a child; and it might cost the insurance companies money. My chief of staff had a child who was born with an ailment. That kid, from the day of conception to the day after he was born, had insurance. As soon as the insurance company found out that that child had a serious problem, they stopped the insurance. The family al-most went into bankruptcy; but for the friends and support around them, they would have done so. That is over. Every child born in America will con- tinue to have health care coverage, whether they are healthy or not. It’s a good day. It’s a good day for the chil-dren. It’s a good day for the people of America. Mr. ELLISON. Well, Congressman, I share your joy today. And I want to let you know that the fact is that there are a lot of really important parts of this bill, and not enough Americans understand what’s in the bill. I can remember back a couple of years ago when I was trying to have community forums in my district, and people who didn’t understand the need for health care reform would get loud and boisterous in these meetings. And I would let them talk. I wouldn’t let them disrupt the meeting, but I would let them talk. And some of them ex-pressed themselves in very passionate ways. One of the things they said to me was, Did you read the bill? And they wouldn’t ask the question. They would basically make an accusation that I didn’t read the bill. Of course I had read the bill. And I think it’s now a good idea to really help people understand what VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00265 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4424 June 28, 2012 good things are in this bill. For exam- ple, I think it’s important for people to understand that already in the bill, if you have a child under the age of 26, that child can be on your health care insurance. No more worries that your college graduate kid, who has not yet got that job, is just out there with no insurance. If you are a woman, they can’t discriminate against you any-more. If you have a preexisting condi-tion and you are a child, even at this moment, they can’t discriminate against you. And when the bill is fully in effect, they won’t be able to dis-criminate against anyone. If you are a senior, we’re helping to make the cost of prescription drugs more affordable by filling the doughnut hole. Also, for Medicare, we have a pro-vision in there that’s helping to make sure that preventative screenings are free in order to have healthy, strong seniors to prevent them from getting sick. There’s a medical loss ratio which says that the insurance company has to devote 85 percent of their receipts into health care, not all this other ad-ministrative stuff, including exorbi-tant pay. So as we sit back and reflect on what is actually in there, I think it’s impor-tant to make those points. Is there anything you would like to add? Mr. GARAMENDI. Let me just take up some of those numbers because they’re very, very exciting. Thirteen million Americans will re- ceive $1.1 billion in rebates because the insurance companies have overcharged them. That didn’t happen before this bill. I didn’t have that power, as insur-ance commissioner, to do that; 54 mil-lion Americans that are in private health insurance plans will receive free preventative services as a result of this legislation. Mr. ELLISON. Fifty-four million— wow. Mr. GARAMENDI. And, of course, women—millions across this Nation— will receive free coverage for com-prehensive women’s preventative health services: Pap smears, breast x rays and the like. In 2011, 32.5 million seniors received one or more preventa-tive services. In 2012, 14 million seniors have already received these services. 105 million Americans will no longer have a lifetime limit on their coverage. Before this bill was in effect, if you go up to $100,000 or $200,000—if you had a serious illness, you could go through that, bam—that’s it. You don’t get any more coverage. No longer. No more limits. Lifetime limits are gone. Seventeen million children with pre- existing conditions can no longer be de-nied coverage by insurance companies; 6.6 million young adults—what you were just talking about—you are talk-ing about my daughter. She graduated at the age of 21, 22; lost her insurance. The day after this bill passed, she said, Dad, can I get back on your policy? The answer was yes. Actually, it took 6 months, but it did happen. 5.3 million seniors in the doughnut hole—this is the drug coverage portion—have saved $3.7 billion on prescription drugs al-ready. Now, our good friends, the Repub- licans, want to repeal all of this. So you go through this list: 13 million Americans will not receive a rebate if the Republicans succeed in repealing the bill; 54 million Americans will not receive preventative services; 6.6 mil-lion young Americans will not be on their parents’ coverage between the age of 21 and 26. There are a lot of takeaways from what the Republicans want to do with their repeal. Mr. ELLISON. If the gentleman would yield, I think that is a very im-portant point to make. Sadly, as soon as the Affordable Care Act was upheld, our friends in the Republican Caucus immediately said, Well, we’re going to have a repeal vote. Well, they’ve al-ready had a repeal vote. What are we doing this over and over and over again for? Well, we’re doing it for a very im-portant reason: to make a political point. As they were announcing another re- peal vote—another repeal vote—we haven’t done anything about student loans this week, which are expiring. We haven’t done anything about jobs. And we haven’t done anything about the transit bill, which is due to expire. I mean, it’s just really amazing how much time we have for stuff that doesn’t matter, just political games-manship. But, you know, I must share this with you, Congressman. I’m saddened by the fact that our Republican friends won’t join with us in this awesome good thing that happened to the Amer-ican people today. I wish they would fi-nally come around. It’s like, look, you know, you fought the health care— Well, first of all, between 2000 and 2006, you had the White House, the Sen-ate, and the House of Representatives. You didn’t do anything except give a bunch of money to Big Pharma. And we’re trying to fix that right now. But all this stuff they talk about. Oh, we want to sell insurance across State lines. We want to do tort reform. They could have done all of that. They didn’t do it because they didn’t want to do it. Now they say that’s what they would have done, but that’s not what they did do when they could have done it. So there you go with that. So now we, the Democrats, went and took up health care. After many, many years of trying, we get it through. They fight it tooth and nail. To their credit, none of them supported the final vote on the Affordable Care Act. They were solid and unanimously against conferring the benefits that are contained in the Affordable Care Act. Well, now they got around to saying the bill was unconstitutional. It’s un- constitutional. And you heard this hue and cry day and night. And they even called themselves ‘‘constitutional con-servatives.’’ Well, the constitutional Court has said, This bill is constitutional. So you would think they would say, Okay, okay. We just wanted to make sure it’s constitutional. Now we’re ready to join hands with you and celebrate this great thing to make sure all Americans can go to the doctor. But what do they do? They schedule a repeal vote. Here’s what I want people to know, Congressman: according to the Con-gressional Budget Office—which is a nonpartisan entity—if they repeal this bill, it will add to the deficit $230 bil-lion. These are my friends who never tire of saying, Oh, we’re conferring debt on our children and grandchildren. They always say that. I’m sure it’s been tested by, you know, some high- paid individual who does that kind of stuff. They never tire of saying, Our children and grandchildren, we are pil-ing debt on our children and grand-children. But if they strip the Affordable Care Act, as they plan on doing on July 11, they would drop a big debt and add to the deficit. Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you so very much, Mr. E LLISON . And thank you for your leadership on this and so many other issues. I’m looking at that sign next to you: ‘‘Republicans’ No-Jobs Agenda.’’ A re-peal of the Affordable Health Care Act and the Patients’ Bill of Rights is not going to create jobs. In fact, it is going to make it very, very difficult for small businesses because the Afford-able Health Care Act actually helps small businesses. Mr. ELLISON. Right. b1810 Mr. GARAMENDI. They don’t have the mandate. Small businesses don’t have the mandate. But what they do have is an opportunity. They have an opportunity to get health insurance at an affordable cost, which they’ve never had before. Small business, one-person, or husband and wife, perhaps, and two or three employees, it literally was im-possible for them to get affordable health insurance for themselves and for their three employees. Under this bill, they can get it. It’s subsidized, to be sure. But they can fi-nally get insurance. And across the State of California and across this Na-tion we’re finding thousands upon thousands of businesses for the first time going into the insurance market, able to buy insurance, getting coverage for themselves and their employees while providing what insurance must do, which is the knowledge and the sta-bility that is necessary for the finances of that business to succeed. The other thing—and I’m just going to pick up one more that’s very, very close to me—in California, the Afford-able Care Act provided funding for 1,154 clinics. Way back in 1978, when I was in the California legislature, and in 1976 as a member of the Assembly, I au-thored legislation to establish the Rural Health Act. And that built clin-ics in the rural part of California. And today, as a result of that, there are VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00266 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4425 June 28, 2012 clinics all across the State of Cali- fornia, and the Affordable Care Act keeps those clinics in business. This is where many Californians and across this Nation Americans access the health care system. It’s there in their community. These are the com-munity clinics that are so critically important in providing the health care that Americans need. The call for re-peal kills these clinics. These clinics will die if this bill is repealed. So out across the State, even in the most conservative part of my new dis-trict, Colusa County, there are clinics that are dependent upon this legisla-tion and will be able to continue as a result of the Affordable Care Act, found by the Supreme Court, including Chief Justice Roberts, to be constitutional. This is constitutional. The legislature, Congress, and the Senate and the President have the power to solve one of the great America dilemmas: The health care system. Over time, we’ll change this. We’ll make modifications. Among those modifications ought to be an expansion of Medicare, which is efficient, effec-tive, and universally available to every American over the age of 65. How good it is. How hard and how determined people are—if I can just live to 65, I’ll have Medicare. It’s a great program. We ought to expand it. We ought to make it universal. Mr. E LLISON , I don’t know how much time you have. Mr. ELLISON. We’ve got about 30 minutes or so. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, there are things we can talk about. Mr. ELLISON. I would actually like to take up what happened with Eric Holder today. Mr. GARAMENDI. Let’s talk about that. Mr. ELLISON. The Holder case, Eric Holder, when he came in office, this program, the Fast and Furious, was on-going. It was a gunwalking program. The original theory was that if you put some guns into the stream of com-merce, then you can find out who’s buying them, who’s selling them, and try to get to the bottom of some of these cartels that trade in illegal guns, straw purchasers and so forth. Well, it was a poorly conceived plan, and trag-edy occurred. A border enforcement of-ficer, Officer Terry, was killed as a re-sult with one of these guns. We all pause in his honor and offer our sincere condolences to his family. When Attorney General Holder found out about this program, he shut the program down. But then, of course, as facts came to light, it is a legitimate source of investigation. And he sub-mitted to nine hearings, 8,000 pages of documentation. But when it finally got down to it, when there was information that was of a deliberative nature—not on the facts of what happened to Offi-cer Terry, but just exchange of infor-mation—and pending criminal informa-tion, which everyone in this room should know is not for public consump-tion, when that information was sought, the administration, the White House said, No, we’re going to exercise executive privilege. Obviously, if the President exercises executive privilege, the Attorney General has to abide by that decision. And despite all those facts, today on the House floor the Republican major-ity, instead of dealing with jobs, in-stead of dealing with health care, in-stead of dealing with renewing the stu-dent loan interest rates, which are about to double; instead of dealing with the transportation bill, which is about to expire, we go do a witch hunt on Eric Holder. It’s really too bad. Any thoughts on this issue you care to share? Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, I do. And like most of my Democratic col-leagues, we just walked out of this Chamber and said this is not worthy of the dignity of the House of Representa-tives. And we weren’t going to honor this process with our presence. Let’s go back here. The Fast and Fu- rious programs actually began in the George W. Bush administration, I think, around 2005, 2006. And there were two iterations of it, two different projects that were underway out of the Phoenix office of the ATF. And they were trying to find out who the gun-runners were. We’ve all watched the Western movies and the gunrunners. Well, there are American gunrunners that were running guns to the narco folks in Mexico. We wanted to find out what is going on here, where are these guns coming from. And that was, once again, during the George W. Bush ad-ministration and had gone on for 2, 3 years. The Obama administration comes in. Eric Holder is chosen as Attorney Gen-eral. And the program continued. The tragedy occurred. An agent was killed. And from there, Fast and Furious—this is now what we call the walking of the guns—became known. Eric Holder shut it down. In that process, a letter was written to the Senate committee say-ing that it didn’t exist. Clearly, an error, I am told. But this House doesn’t know today. Never investigated by the committee. But I am told that there was information that the office in Phoenix, Arizona, misled the office in Washington, D.C., and a letter was sent forth that was incorrect. That should be the subject of the investigation: What happened here; what actually went on in Arizona. Not one witness from the actual op- eration was called to testify. Not one. So this is really a very strange and botched investigation. If you want to get to the bottom of it, you’ve got to talk to the people that actually did it. It didn’t happen. The Democrats on the committee demanded several times: Bring forth the people who did the Fast and Furious from the Bush administra-tion into the Obama administration. Bring them forward. Get their testi-mony. Find out what happened. Find out about the communications between the Phoenix office and the Washington, D.C., office. It didn’t happen. So in terms of an investigation, you have a partial investigation focusing on the end of the story rather than on the full story. And today, the first time ever in the history of this Nation, this body voted to hold in contempt a Cabi-net official on a half-baked, insuffi-cient investigation that purposefully ignored calling witnesses that were ac-tually engaged in the Fast and Furious operation and who were responsible in the Phoenix office for that operation. b1820 It was a farce. It was a political event, and we walked out. Not a good day. And as you said a moment ago, there are things we must do. Men and women and families across this country are hurting. They’re unemployed. They want jobs. They want to go to work. Transportation, where’s the transpor-tation bill? We never did get one out of this House that was meaningful. We just passed a little thing so we can get to conference. It had nothing in it, but it allowed us to go to conference. Where’s that bill? How about student interest rates, where’s that bill? And what about the jobs program? What if the September 2011 proposal that President Obama put forward, the American Jobs Act, what if we had taken that up? Three million, 4 million Americans would be working today. What if we had done that? But it didn’t happen. Our colleagues on the Repub-lican side refused to bring it up in this House and refused to allow it to be brought up in the Senate. That’s sad. That’s a very sad thing for America. It is one of the great ‘‘we should haves,’’ but we were prevented from doing so. Mr. ELLISON. Well, Congressman, I have some obligations that require me to curtail our hour a little early. You can carry on if you like. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, I, too, must go. But I thank you very much for al-lowing me to talk about three very im-portant things. I appreciate that, Mr. E LLISON . Mr. ELLISON. You are famous for nailing the need for a greater invest-ment in manufacturing and supporting American jobs, and I thank you for all of the great work you’re doing. Mr. GARAMENDI. You must mean Make It in America. Spend our tax money on American-made equipment and jobs, not on Chinese or Japanese or anybody else, but on American jobs. We can do that. Mr. ELLISON. We can do it. Let me wrap up by saying it has been a great evening, a great day for the American people. The Affordable Care Act has been vindicated in the Su-preme Court. Unfortunately, the day is somewhat marred by the unfortunate behavior of the majority in trying to go after Eric Holder. Nonetheless, it’s another day in Washington. The Progressive Caucus will be back next week. Thank you very much.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4426 June 28, 2012 I yield back the balance of my time. f APPOINTMENT AS MEMBER TO UNITED STATES-CHINA ECO-NOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair announces the Speaker’s ap-pointment, pursuant to section 1238(b)(3) of the Floyd D. Spence Na-tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (22 U.S.C. 7002), as amended, and the order of the House of January 5, 2011, of the following mem-ber on the part of the House to the United States-China Economic and Se-curity Review Commission for a term to expire December 31, 2014: Mr. Peter Brookes, Springfield, Vir- ginia f SUPREME COURT HEALTH CARE DECISION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 5, 2011, the gentleman from Geor-gia (Mr. G RAVES ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the major-ity leader. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speak- er, I rise today with a group of col-leagues of mine to speak in contrast to what we just heard. It is shocking to me, not only the news of today and the continuation of the overreach of the Federal Government, but to hear col-leagues on the other side of the aisle who are advocating for the Progressive Caucus, the progressive movement in this Nation celebrating, truly cele-brating the Supreme Court ruling of today which allows the Federal Gov-ernment to continue reaching into the homes of American families all across this country in a way that has never been done before, and granted so much more taxing power that has never been granted before, and yet they celebrate. And they used a lot of different terms, like ‘‘charting the new course.’’ That was a phrase that was used by the Progressive Caucus here just a moment ago—charting the new course. One has to wonder: What is this new course? It has been a course that the progressive movement has been on now for nearly a century; and today they are cele-brating that course continuing to be charted, and that is a course of more government and less liberty. And that is what this decision was all about today. It was about empowering gov-ernment and not empowering the American people. It is about creating more government and less liberty. That’s what the decision reflected today. I am joined today by many good friends here in the House of Represent-atives who are on the side of liberty. They’re on the side of the American taxpayers, and they’re on the side of the private sector. They believe in free markets and capitalism and profits and success and dreaming, and they don’t think that the Federal Government has to get in the way of any of that. Mr. Speaker, I would like to first yield to the gentleman from New Jer-sey (Mr. G ARRETT ) to get his insights on today’s decisions. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. G RAVES for leading the floor to- night on this very important matter. He joins me, I’m sure, in saying that we’re all extremely disappointed that we have to come to the floor tonight and that the Supreme Court ruled today that the Commerce Clause does not support the individual mandate, but it may be upheld within Congress’s power to lay and collect taxes. So what we have found today is that Congress cannot use the Commerce Clause to compel you to do something. But, instead, Congress can tax you into submission. It should have been crystal clear that the Commerce Clause, which grants power to Congress to enforce free trade pacts amongst the States, could not use that clause to regulate it. If Congress can force you to purchase a product, then there is nothing gov-ernment cannot force you to do. This would have been a violation of your in-dividual liberties as well as the con-stitutional doctrine of enumerated powers in which Congress is only given few and specific powers. As the Supreme Court’s syllabus of this case states: The Framers knew the difference between doing something and doing nothing. They gave Congress the power to regulate com-merce, not to compel it. Ignoring that dis-tinction would undermine the principle that the Federal Government is a government of limited and enumerated powers. But the Supreme Court instead told us that Congress has the power to tax and tax and tax until you submit to it. Is this at all consistent with the founding principles of this country? Did those brave patriots who fought in the Revolutionary War and faced es-trangement from their families, who endured British cannon fire and mus-ket fire, weathered freezing winters and blazing summers, marched without shoes, slept without blankets, and suf-fered perpetual starvation all so that Congress could tax the people to form their behavior in Congress’s image? Did the Founders, who objected to the Stamp Act, the Sugar Act, and the Declaratory Act, which led our great Nation to revolt, risk the charge of treason and put their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor at risk, all so that they could replace one King who de-manded more taxation, and now re-place it with a President who demands more taxation? No. We are Americans, citizens of a con- stitutional Republic where individual liberty is our birthright, won by our Founding generation’s sacrifices. We are not and shall never be mere sub-jects of a government that can tax its way to tyranny. And disturbing as it is, there are many problems with this ma-jority Court’s rationale. You see, the Obama administration has been confused as to whether or not the monetary penalty for failure to pay is in fact a tax or not. But even if we accept the penalty as a tax, as the Court has rewritten the law to be, such a tax is still unconstitutional for many reasons. First, the Constitution lays out three types of permissible taxes. This tax is not accessed on income, so it is uncon-stitutional in that regard. This tax is not assessed uniformly and is triggered by economic inactivity so it is uncon-stitutional in that regard. And the tax is not apportioned among the States by population, so it is unconstitutional in that regard. Even more importantly, the Con- stitution does not grant Congress an independent power to tax for any pur-pose that it wants. Taxing to provide for the general welfare does not mean there is limitless power of Congress to tax. Rather, it means that a tax must be for a national purpose to achieve the ends that are outlined within the enu-merated powers. Now, this is not only my view; this was the view of James Madison, who ought to know a little bit about the Constitution since he is the man most responsible for it. There is nothing about the individual mandate defined as a tax that is sanc-tioned by the Constitution. But we have strayed far from the Constitution of the Founders. No longer is the ability to tax constrained by the limits imposed by that great document. The growth and power of this government would render it not only unrecognizable, but also repulsive to the Founders. Madison and his fellow revolution- aries worried about the growth of gov-ernment and the yielding of liberty. The writings they left for posterity are full of warnings about the fragility of limited government. Madison believed Republican governments would perpet-ually be on the defensive against the encroachments of aspiring tyrants. John Adams agreed when he said, ‘‘De-mocracy never lasts long.’’ And perhaps the most famous quote of all was Ben Franklin at the Con-stitutional Convention when he said we have produced ‘‘a republic, if you can keep it.’’ And now, 225 years later, we have ar- rived at this moment. We should strive to restore the free society of our Founding Fathers that they fought for. If liberty is our goal, the Supreme Court has failed the American people. And so although we come here tonight extremely dis-appointed that the Supreme Court did not rise to the defense of the Constitu-tion, I can take solace with the knowl-edge that the people of this country will. b1830 See, the Americans of this country revere the Constitution, and they will not let it be trampled upon. They long cherish their liberties. They will not surrender them without a fight.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4427 June 28, 2012 Since the enactment of ObamaCare, I have seen the tireless efforts of patri-ots, both in my district, in the State, and across the country, trying to re-peal ObamaCare. I am inspired by their passion, by their determination to de-fend the Constitution. This generation of Americans will not allow history to say that we presided over the demise of the American experiment in limited government. Now, it is true that the struggle against ObamaCare has been long and difficult and sometimes met, as today, with disappointing results. But for those of us who still believe in our founding principles, I offer some advice from Thomas Jefferson, who said, ‘‘The ground of liberty is to be gained by inches.’’ So we stand here tonight all to- gether, pledging to work alongside the people of this great Nation who will fight inch by inch in defense of the Constitution, and we will repeal ObamaCare. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare must be repealed entirely, because if it is not, the constitutional Republic and the safeguards of our natural rights through limited government will be lost. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for your inspirational remarks reflecting back on the history of this country and the great leaders and the Founders and the principles which this Nation was based upon. While the erosion continues—and we’ve seen more of it even today with the ruling—the resolve is even strong-er. So to those that may be listening or watching, you can know that there is a group of Members in the House of Rep-resentatives that are not going to let up, that are going to be fully resolved to repealing ObamaCare in its entirety, pulling it out, each and every root of this legislation, and empowering the people and not empowering govern-ment. Because, why? Because this is not a government of the Court, by the Court, or for the Court. This is a gov-ernment of the people, by the people, and for the people, and I am convinced that the people will have their voice heard in the next few months. So as we heard from the progressives earlier in their continued march down this new chartered course of more gov-ernment and less liberty, we are thank-fully joined tonight by a great friend of liberty and a great advocate of liberty, and that is Louis Gohmert from Texas. I’d like to yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. GOHMERT. I sure do appreciate my friend from Georgia. He is an abso-lute patriot, standing for truth, jus-tice, and what used to be the American way. It is, according to the Supreme Court, not so much anymore. And I ap-preciate the gentleman for yielding. I’ve been going through this decision, and having been an attorney—and I’ve been a prosecutor and a judge and a chief justice. It was a small, three- judge court, but you learn things—you go to judicial conferences—about how to write opinions and things, never to the level of the United States Supreme Court. But as a certified member of the United States Supreme Court Bar, you follow the holdings of the courts. So it’s been with great interest, after I got my wind back from having found that Chief Justice Roberts wrote the opinion for the five-person majority, okay, so we start going through the opinion. Let’s see how in the world he came to this conclusion. Well, I’ll be very brief in jumping through, even though it’s a very long opinion, including the dissents. But the first thing that the Court had to con-sider is the Anti-Injunction Act that was passed by Congress years ago that makes very clear that the Supreme Court cannot take up any issue regard-ing a tax unless the tax has actually been levied and someone required to pay the tax, and then someone against whom the tax has been levied—required to pay that tax—files suit, that person then has standing. Well, under ObamaCare, if the mandate is a tax, the penalty is a tax, then the Anti-In-junction Act would kick in and no one would be allowed to have standing be-fore the Federal district court, court of appeals, and certainly not the U.S. Su-preme Court. So the first thing the Supreme Court had to get past was the issue of: Is this penalty a tax? Because if it’s a tax, then the Supreme Court must throw this case out, announce that the plain-tiffs in these cases have no standing— and will not until around 2014—until such time as the tax is levied. So the Court goes through, and if anybody prints out the decision, you can look at pages 11 through 15 specifi-cally where they discuss the Anti-In-junction Act. They point out just, in essence, what I have hopefully clari-fied: If it’s a penalty, then the Court can take it up. If the penalty that you must pay for not buying the insurance is a tax, then this case goes out, no Su-preme Court decision for at least 2 to 4 years. So Chief Justice Roberts—brilliant man, there’s no question he’s a very brilliant intellectual—he indicates this and says: Congress’s decision to label this exac- tion a penalty rather than a tax is sig-nificant because the Affordable Care Act describes many other exactions it creates that are taxes. And he says this: Where Congress uses certain lan- guage in one part of a statute and dif-ferent language in another, it is gen-erally presumed that Congress acts in-tentionally. So he goes on and he says: The Anti-Injunction Act and the Af- fordable Care Act are creatures of Con-gress’ own creation. How they relate to each other is up to Congress, and the best evidence—the Supreme Court’s words, Justice Roberts’ words—the best evidence of Congress’ intent is the stat-utory language, the statutory text. So he goes on to conclude that since Congress says in ObamaCare, the Af-fordable Care Act—boy, is that a mis-nomer, the Affordable Care Act—since Congress calls it a penalty, then Jus-tice Roberts and the majority say it’s not a tax; it is a penalty. So around page 15 or so, 15, 16, they come around and say—I guess, 15, okay: Congress made clear that the penalty is what it is—not a tax. Therefore, the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply, so our Court has jurisdiction. As he says, the Anti-Injunction Act, therefore, does not apply to this suit since it’s a penalty and not a tax. Therefore, as he says, we may proceed to the merits. Okay. So he clears it’s a penalty; it’s not a tax. Because if it’s a tax, they can’t do anything; they’ve got to throw it out. Okay. So it’s a penalty, not a tax. So then he goes on, after page 16, he goes on in the majority opinion to dis-cuss this issue of whether or not it vio-lates the Commerce Clause, this pen-alty. He comes to the proper conclu-sion that if Congress can mandate a penalty for not buying a product, there’s nothing to stop Congress from intruding in every area of individual Americans’ lives. It’s mentioned in this opinion that the main purpose—one of the two main purposes is to bring down the cost of health care. The Supreme Court thinks that’s a legitimate reason to pass an act, bring down the cost of health care. But Justice Roberts and the majority decide it would violate the Commerce Clause, because if you can force indi-vidual Americans to buy a particular product in order to bring down the cost of health care, you can order anything. You and I can be ordered to join a gym and to start exercising X number of hours a week. We’re told that the Federal Govern- ment does not monitor debit card and credit card purchases—although, sup-posedly it could. Well, if it has a duty to bring down health care costs and it has the ability to watch your pur-chases, and, under ObamaCare, the Federal Government, through their re-lationship with General Electric— sweetheart deal they did with GE— they’re going to hold everybody’s med-ical records. So if they’re holding everybody’s medical records, then I don’t know why they wouldn’t go ahead and monitor everybody’s choles-terol rate, blood pressure, things like that. b1840 And so it could conceivably get to the point where, gee, you get a letter from the government that says, we no-tice your cholesterol rate’s up to 250 or so and we notice you bought bacon this weekend. What were you thinking? You know, you’ve got to take that back. You can’t keep bacon. Anyway, there’s no limit to what Congress can do to intrude in people’s lives. And I’d point out to my friend from Georgia, liberals are constantly VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00269 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4428 June 28, 2012 on the protection of bedroom privacy rights. I really thought that once they fully examined the potential effect of ObamaCare, they would be standing down here with you and me and my other friends hear, Louisiana, Georgia, they’d be out here saying, wait a minute. If the government has the right to order us to do or not do acts or buy or not buy products for the sole purpose of bringing down the costs of health care, there are studies that say some certain relational activities cre-ate more risk for health care problems than others, so if this is true, the Fed-eral Government would have the right not only to invade the kitchen and the bathroom, but head straight to the bedroom and dictate people’s rights. I didn’t want to go there, and I felt like once we found out that Chief Jus-tice Roberts makes clear, this is a pen-alty, not a tax, it violates the Com-merce Clause to force people to buy a product like this, you would think that would be the end of it. But then Chief Justice Roberts goes on, and it doesn’t make sense because then he begins to say, well, it violates the Commerce Clause, but does it vio-late the Tax-and-Spend Clause? And then he goes through and makes a case for saying, it’s not a penalty, it’s a tax. And he’s already told us that the best way to tell what it is is to look what Congress called it. And I think, in this case, not only look what Congress called it, look at what the President called it. I just happen to have a partial ex- cerpt or an excerpt from the transcript of a show the President did with his friend, George Stephanopolous. And Stephanopolous is asking him about it and said, you know, under this man-date, the government’s forcing people to spend money, fining you if you don’t. How is that not a tax? Well, President Obama goes on and he lays out all this weak gibberish, and eventually gets—Stephanopolous inter-rupts him and says, okay, that may be, but it’s still a tax increase. And the President said, that’s not true, George. For us to say that you’ve got to take responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase. The President also says, nobody con- siders that a tax increase. He’s not done making clear the will of the Congress and of the President, who pushed this bill to make it his shining bill that he had passed through Congress. Stephanopolous goes on and says, I want to check for myself, but your critics say it’s a tax increase. President Obama says, my critics say everything is a tax increase. Stephanopolous: But you reject that it’s a tax increase. President Obama says, I absolutely reject that notion. Not a tax increase. So you would think that if Chief Jus- tice Roberts and the majority, the other four, are going to uphold the President’s prize bill, he might accept what the President said he’s done in this bill. But oh, no. After finding that it’s not a tax, it’s a penalty, then Chief Justice Roberts comes over to page 39 and he says, the joint dissenters argue that we cannot uphold section 5000(a) as a tax because Congress did not ‘‘frame it’’ as such. And then he goes on and he says, la- bels should not control here. What? He just said before, Congress’ own expressed written intent is the best evidence of what their intent is. And yet, now he comes over here, page 39 and says, wait, wait, wait. We have to look at what the intent is, but labels should not control. So then he goes through and makes this ridiculous argument that it is a tax. And he says over here, page 44, the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that certain individuals pay a financial pen-alty for not obtaining health insurance may be reasonably considered as a tax because the Constitution permits such tax. It’s not our role to forbid it or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness. But then, one of the big mysteries in this brilliant man’s opinion for the ma-jority uses the first person pronoun, I. Now, you know, anybody that’s been a judge, normally you go to judicial con-ferences, you have seminars, you have training in writing style. If it’s an indi-vidual judge, sole court opinion, then you’ll write it one way. If it’s a mul-tiple justice opinion you write it an-other way. You see first person pronoun I in dis- sents, even though it’s really not the best grammar to use pronouns in dis-sents. But you don’t see them in well- written majority opinions. And Chief Justice Roberts is one of the best lin-guists we’ve had on the Court. And he takes Justice Ginsberg to task a few different places in the ma-jority opinion, and yet, she is one of his voting justices to support the ma-jority. That doesn’t make sense. You don’t normally see one justice writing the majority opinion take off and criticize someone who’s voting with him. That doesn’t make sense. But here at page 44 he says, Justice Ginsberg questions the necessity of re-jecting the government’s commerce power argument, given that section 5000(a) can be upheld under the taxing power. He says, Chief Justice Roberts, ma- jority opinion, but the statute reads more naturally as a command to buy insurance than as a tax. So now he’s back to what he originally said before he says it is a tax. And then he says this: And I, Chief Justice Roberts, would uphold it, talk-ing basically of future perfect tense. I would uphold it as a command if the Constitution allowed it. I would uphold it. He’s writing for the majority. There’s no reason for him to have the first per-son pronoun ‘‘I’’ there. It doesn’t make sense. I don’t know. Maybe this part he was writing as a dissent, and all of a sudden found himself in the majority, and amazingly, nobody caught this problem of style in writing the opinion. It doesn’t make sense that a man that smart would have a product this poor, using first person, criticizing an-other justice in the majority with him, then saying what he would do. Well, he is doing, he’s writing the majority opinion. He has no business saying that. And then he goes through, it says the States also can end Medicaid, expan-sion exceeds authority under the spending clause. But basically he comes back and upholds it, and then strikes down that you can’t force the States to do these things. But, I remind my friends, the Presi- dent says it’s absolutely not a tax. The only way this bill gets upheld is if the Supreme Court finds it is a tax after they find jurisdiction by saying it’s not a tax. But this is the same President who said, if you like your health insurance, you’re going to keep it. He said, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. We found those were lies. He said, it’s going to bring down the cost of health care. In every indication we’ve seen, insurance has dramatically gone up. And I get tired of hearing peo-ple say, because their memories are poor in here across the aisle, well, look at the good things in here. Twenty-six year olds can be on their own parents’ insurance. Gee, you can buy insurance across State lines because of us. We’ve taken care of the unfairness that some insurance used with preexisting condi-tions as an exclusion. But I would encourage my friends, I know my colleagues here remember, back when they had the House, they had the Senate majority, they had the White House, Republicans, many of us begged them, let us do some bipartisan bills together because we can agree. It’s not a problem to let 26-year olds stay on your parents’ insurance. Heck, the insurance companies love that be-cause they are usually healthy. It’s not a big cost. So we were going to be able to agree on that. It was a Republican, heck, John Shadegg is the first one I ever heard saying you’ve got to sell insurance across State lines. That was a Repub-lican idea, so of course most of us sup-ported that. b1850 As for the preexisting conditions, most of us are aware of circumstances in which insurance companies have been grossly unfair in using that exclu-sion. We were prepared to reach some agreements and have bipartisan, stand-alone bills. I know that my friend Dr. P RICE out here had some concern about health care, his having devoted his life to it before government, trying to fix what government had done to health care. People have been concerned about it. We were willing to agree on these things, but they would not have it. So to say without ObamaCare we don’t have these other things is simply not true, and it forgets current history. We were ready to agree on standalone VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00270 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4429 June 28, 2012 bills. They didn’t want a bipartisan agreement. They wanted the whole brass ring and to shove it around our heads, around our necks, and eventu-ally down our throats, and that is what has happened. I’ve been amazed at how many people have picked up laws and started reading them, and I would en-courage them to read this opinion. It’s a very, very strange opinion. It con-tradicts itself on so many levels. ObamaCare takes away religious freedom. I’m Baptist. I see what they’re doing to the Catholics, and I don’t want to someday say, ‘‘I saw what they did to the Catholics, and I remained silent,’’ and eventually there was nobody to object when they did it to me. We all have to stand together, and I’m grateful to stand with my friends. One other comment. I heard my Dem- ocrat friends before we spoke say, with-out this ObamaCare bill, these clinics will die. There have been clinics before the ObamaCare bill that helped. We have some in my district, and they’re doing wonderful work. They need more help. The best are, really, charitable institu-tions. The clinics are not going to die. What came from the President’s mouth and was also in his town hall was when a woman in the White House, as part of the town hall, said, Mr. President, at an advanced age, my mother got a pacemaker. If the doctor had not met her, the cardiologist was not going to let her have a pacemaker. After he met her, he said, absolutely, and she has lived years beyond that since she has had a pacemaker. So would you consider someone’s quality of life under your panels—we know they don’t want to call them ‘‘death panels,’’ but whatever you want to call them—will they be able to consider the quality of life that people have before they agree or disagree to let them have a procedure? The President beat around the bush as he did with Stephanopoulos—and you can find the transcript. It’s avail-able on the Net—and ultimately said, You know, maybe we’re just better off telling your mother to take a pain pill. You don’t get a pacemaker. You don’t get these additional years of life. You get a pain pill. So, when our friends across the aisle tonight say that the clinics will die, I would humbly submit that, based on the President’s own words, it’s not the clinics that will die under this bill. I thank you so much for your gen- erous yielding of so much time. It’s a bad opinion, and I appreciate having the time to walk through some of it. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Texas for walking us through the opinion. I hope all those who are viewing this understand that this is about a tax now. This is a new taxing authority, in essence, a broadening of the taxing au-thority. As Mr. G OHMERT brought up, this is unheard of. We will now have a Federal Government that can do what-ever it wants to do through taxation. In just thinking about the difference between ‘‘tax’’ and ‘‘penalty,’’ I guess one way to find out is, who do you send the check to, right? I mean, where is the bill coming from? I imagine it’s going to be from the Internal Revenue Service. I remember being on the Ap-propriations Committee and having the IRS before us. It was wanting hundreds of millions of more dollars to hire more people for the implementation of ObamaCare, and now we all know why, and we know what that agency or that department collects. So here is the crux of the decision today: While the Court might have said, well, the Federal Government can’t tell you what to do, they can sure as heck punish you through taxes if you don’t do what they want you to do, which is to be followed up here by my friend from Kansas (Mr. H UELSKAMP ) who has got some great insight. Thank you for joining us. Mr. HUELSKAMP. Thank you, Con- gressman G RAVES . I appreciate your leadership. Sometimes we wish there had been someone like you on the Court today. Actually, before we forget, as for one of the five votes that upheld ObamaCare, in any other court of law, that Justice would have recused her-self. The decision might have only been 4–4. Justice Kagan should not have been in on this decision. In any other court, she would have been recused. If a lawyer had refused to recuse himself as a judge, he would have been vio-lating ethical rules. Every attorney in this country knows that, including the Chief Justice, and they said nothing. Do you know what? I’m not here to talk specifically about that. You talked about taxes. Our other Con-gressman friend did as well. In this bill, there are 21 tax increases by the definition of the Court, but I want to talk about two in particular because I believe, when we look back on the American system of a once lim-ited government, this day, June 28, 2012, will stand as the definitive date in the advance of government tyranny. In today’s ruling, a slim majority of the Court turned the Constitution on its head and ruled that the Federal Gov-ernment, in effect, can force upon the American people anything it darned well pleases so long as it’s called a ‘‘tax.’’ Let’s not forget that, when our Founding Fathers put everything on the line, risking life, limb, and prop-erty to make us an independent Na-tion, they did so in order to ensure that no man was taxed without representa-tion. They also asserted that every man and woman has inalienable rights that are not to be violated by the gov-ernment. They enshrined these con-cepts in the Declaration of Independ-ence and, ultimately, in our Constitu-tion. Today, in my opinion, the Supreme Court offered a perverse interpretation of the Bill of Rights. Just across the street from here, they said that, even though you have a right to do some-thing, the decision to exercise that right will incur a tax. The decision to exercise that right, said the Chief Jus-tice of the U.S. Supreme Court, will incur a tax. Can you imagine the limitless possi- bilities for Washington? Why not ex-tend this interpretation to other parts of the Constitution? For example, why not tax the exercise of your First Amendment rights? Sure, you’ve got First Amendment rights. Send your Member of Congress a letter, but pay a fine to the govern-ment. That makes sense under this rul-ing. Sell a newspaper or publish a blog. Don’t forget to tell the IRS and the new 16,500 agents they want to hire to enforce it. What about a right to a fair and speedy trial? That’s guaranteed, but you know, that’s yours to have but for a fee. That’s the lack of logic. For average Americans who love their Constitution, these are guaranteed. They’re not al-lowed to be imposed if you pay the fine or the fee. One thing in particular I want to talk about, Congressman G RAVES , is that, in addition to this health insur-ance mandate tax, the President’s health care law creates what is clearly a religion tax. A religion tax? Yes, you heard me right, and it’s even if you morally or ethically disagree with something being promoted. Right now, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and former Governor of Kan-sas, look at her record. Most Ameri-cans would completely disagree with her moral views, but if you disagree with her mandates of the President’s health care plan, it doesn’t matter. You will still have to pay for it. If you dare to follow your conscience and, maybe, actually practice your faith or no faith whatsoever and refuse to par-ticipate, you will be fined. Why? You will be taxed because of what you be-lieve and your desire to live it out. You will be forced to give your hard-earned money to the IRS in Washington, D.C., because of what you believe. That, my friends, is a religion tax. It’s a faith tax. It’s a direct attack on our freedom of religion. Now, today the Court didn’t rule on that. There are dozens and dozens and dozens of lawsuits coming on about the HHS mandate coming out of ObamaCare. This is the start: a tax on religion. I have an employer who sent me an email. He said, Well, Tim, everybody is talking about the individual mandate. What about the employer mandate? I don’t want to cover abortions for my employees. I refuse to participate. He will be fined $3,000 at a minimum for every single employee. Why? Be-cause of what he believes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4430 June 28, 2012 the Chief Justice would have us be- lieve. But they didn’t address this di-rectly in this decision; they’ll be com-ing. This is a shocking attack, I be-lieve, on the first supreme right in the First Amendment, which is the right to believe in and follow the God one chooses. b1900 The Supreme Court may not have dealt ObamaCare the death it deserved, but it’s incumbent upon each and every one of us here in Congress and each and every American. I would have loved to have witnessed a home run, knock it out of the park and say it’s clearly un-constitutional. Again, if Justice Kagan had been ethical, it would have been a 4–4 decision. They didn’t worry about that. Ethics doesn’t matter. It’s just the end. It’s kind of the Progressive Caucus approach. The end justifies the means, but not in America. I ask all Americans to realize this de- cision is not about health care. It’s about liberty. When we have created and designed a method by which future Congresses, future Presidents, can get around any limit in the Constitution— the Constitution is a limit on my power, on every power of every Member in this Chamber and every Member across the way and every President of the United States. That’s what the Constitution does. It doesn’t empower us. It takes away our power. This Court today has said, if you call it a tax, if you use those three words— even though the Chief Justice says ‘‘la-bels don’t matter.’’ He said labels don’t matter, and then he turns around and says the word ‘‘tax’’ does matter. If you do that, it makes it suddenly con-stitutional—anything you do, includ-ing attacking the very faith that is held by the Chief Justice himself. It says, You cannot hold that faith, Mr. Chief Justice, unless you’re willing to be fined by your own government. That is a travesty of justice in this country. What this means is we cannot over- turn this with this President in the White House. This has taken an issue, and people are ready to work on it and say, You know what? This is going to be the issue for November 6. This is the choice. Do you want the government to mandate and control everything in your lives, as long as they use that magic word? They love to use the ‘‘tax’’ word. If you allow them to do that, you allow them to be in every part of your life, which is an absolute contradiction to what this country was founded upon. I appreciate the leadership of many in this room. I am just a freshman. I was not here when this debate started last time, as some of these colleagues who have been fighting all along. But I tell you, if the folks in the First Dis-trict of Kansas are any indication of what Americans are saying all over, this is the time. They’re going to dust off that Constitution. They’re going to read it and say, My goodness. I don’t want to lose this. It’s too precious. We’re leading the world, and now is the time to take back our government, take back our Constitution, and take back power out of Washington, D.C. I appreciate the leadership of the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Kansas for your words. Regarding unintended consequences, I can tell you there are going to be an amazing amount of unintended con-sequences with the Affordable Care Act, which I’m not sure that we can call it that anymore. I think it’s more like the Limited Care Act. It’s the Very Expensive Care Act. For the Progressives that were here earlier—and I know many folks lis-tened to them—they were celebrating. They were excited. They were happy, gleeful; whereas, we’re lamenting but resolved to do away with this once and for all. Why would they be gleeful? Because it’s their movement. That’s what they’ve been trying to do now for al-most 100 years, and that is increase the size of government, get it into the lives of the American people, dictate their behavior, and limit freedom. I read recently that part of their agenda is to divorce the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. But to use one and to prop up on that one so they can almost sort of claim that they are for the founding of this Nation—and we heard earlier when they used the Declaration of Independ-ence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They were celebrating that this was the right bill to be in law be-cause of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If you can claim that with this legislation, there are no bounds in which you can go with this Federal Government, there are no limits. As the gentleman from Kansas just raised, this is clearly not about health care. This is about freedom, and this is about liberty and preserving it for fu-ture generations. I would like to yield to the gen- tleman from Louisiana (Mr. L ANDRY ). Mr. LANDRY. Thank you, Mr. GRAVES . Mr. H UELSKAMP was just on the mark. I will venture to say that to-day’s ruling actually extinguishes the fire of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It destroys life, liberty, and that pursuit. The question today for this country can best be summed up by President Ronald Reagan when he said, back in the 1960s, in a speech: Will history write that those who had the most to lose did the least to pre-vent it from happening? This is a sad and tragic day for the Constitution. Where are the limits of our government? While the Court has answered that the Commerce Clause does have its limits and gives us that ruling, it takes away by saying that Congress has unlimited taxing power. Its limits are unlimited. I guess that Congress now, when it sees fit to regu-late an issue, an industry, need only now to turn to its taxing power, as Mr. H UELSKAMP said. This law was sold to us as a mandate and not a tax. It was reaffirmed by the President that this is not a tax. Yet, when the arguments were made to its constitutionality, this administration took the position that it was a tax, and the Court agreed. Let’s see the taxes. In 2010, an excise tax on charitable hospitals was en- acted; the codification of the economic substance doctrine; a tax hike of $4.5 billion was implemented; a black liq-uor tax hike, a tax that increases on the type of biofuel; a tax on innovator drug companies was enacted; a BlueCross/BlueShield tax hike was en-acted; a tax on indoor canning services was enacted; a medicine cabinet tax, so that Americans are no longer able to use their FSAs, flexible spending ac-counts, or HRAs, their health reim-bursement pretax dollars to purchase nonprescription over-the-counter medi-cine was implemented; the HSA with-draw tax hike was implemented; a tax that will take effect this year, the em-ployer reporting of insurance on W–4s. Where are they going with that, Mr. G RAVES ? Where are they going with that? Remember, not long ago we had a big debate about that, that now we’re going to report to the IRS the amount of your insurance policy that your em-ployer gives you on your W–4, because they want to tax that as income. And then taxes that will take effect in 2013: a surtax on investment income; a hike in the medical payroll tax. Wait, the medical payroll tax? I thought we had a payroll tax holiday. Not in 2013. We’re going to get an in-crease. A tax on medical device manufactur- ers; a flexible spending account cap that is going to affect those parents who have special needs kids. So those parents who have special needs kids that the other side of this aisle claims to always want to rep-resent, this health care law is now going to tax. An elimination of the tax deduction for employers that cover prescription drugs; a $500,000 annual executive com-pensation limit; an individual mandate excise tax; an employer mandate excise tax; a tax on health insurers. And last but not least, in 2018, an ex- cise tax on comprehensive health in-surance plans, which will affect union employees. This ladder of success that we had in this country has now had three rings of it removed, because now the govern-ment tells the individual, if you live below a certain poverty line, you will be given food, shelter, and now health care tax free, no requirement by you who is receiving these, to pay anything back to the government, zero. b1910 What is the incentive to climb? Be- cause the moment you start to climb, you lose these amenities and the gov-ernment starts to take from you.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4431 June 28, 2012 the decision becomes, can I jump high enough to grab a rung so that I can then start paying back and get more of the amenities that the government was giving us and I was provided? Let me conclude as I began, by ask- ing: Will those who have the most to lose do the least to prevent it from happening? And as I spend time in this city, I have come to realize that the gi-ants of America who have been memo-rialized for their great contributions to our society did not contribute with the goal of being memorialized but did what was right and just in the eyes of the Lord, with no ego and no agenda other than for the greater good. And that is what this country so des-perately needs. We need those giants. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana. You brought up one major compo- nent of all this legislation. I remember in one of the State of the Unions, the President said, We need tax reform. Tax reform. I think he got tax reform in this law. What did you say? Twenty-one new taxes are being implemented because of ObamaCare? There are 21 new taxes, and yet the Progressives earlier said, No, this is great for America. Free health care. Affordable health care. No one has to pay. They’ll actually get credits back. Somebody’s got to pay. That’s the way this place works. Whenever they’re promising you something, they’re taking from someone else. And you just laid out 21 different areas that impact every American that the Presi-dent promised he wouldn’t raise taxes on. So I appreciate you doing that. And next, the other component of it is, what’s left? What really was in this health care law, this Big Government expansion, this overreach into the homes of American families? A tremen-dous amount is left. I know Dr. P RICE from Georgia has been leading the fight not only against this measure, but for positive patient- centered and patient-driven measures as well. And I want to thank you for joining us and sharing with us. Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. G RAVES , so very much. I want to commend you for your work on this issue and your leadership for principled solutions, principled solutions in the area of health care and everywhere else. I know that Republicans think every day is the Fourth of July and Demo-crats think that every day is April 15. Why would I say that? Today we’ve been highlighting it in this conversa-tion we’re having here, because our friends on the other side of the aisle be-lieve that every day is another day to raise taxes. Today the Supreme Court of the United States said, If you want to raise taxes, have at it. Raise them as high as you want. In fact, the Democrats are so incredibly happy this day because it’s not just that they can now raise taxes or fight to raise taxes on what we do, but goodness gracious, they can fight to raise taxes on what we don’t do. In fact, if you don’t do something, then the Federal Government can say, Oh, you’d better do that or we’re going to raise your taxes. And that is exactly what the Court said today, which confounds and astounds everybody. I was privileged to sit in the Court today, though, and hear the reading of the ruling, and Chief Justice Roberts said one thing that I found very, very interesting. He said, ‘‘It’s not our job to protect citizens from their political decisions.’’ ‘‘It’s not our job to protect citizens from their political decisions.’’ And that’s exactly what this was. This deci-sion was fixed on Election Day in 2008. This decision came down on Election Day 2008. As a physician, I want to talk for a very brief moment here about the in-credible importance of Election Day 2012 because, as you said, Mr. G RAVES , there are a lot of things in this bill that we’re not just talking about money. As a physician, I know what we’re talking about is people’s lives, the health care of the American people. And nothing could be so important, nothing could be so personal. And what the Court said today is, Let the things in there stand. The $500 bil-lion reduction, the $500 billion decrease from the Medicare program—taking the Medicare program and saying, You don’t need that money, seniors in this country. You don’t need that money. We’re going to use it over here. What does that mean? What that means is that those seniors—your par-ents, your grandparents, the parents and grandparents of this great country, the people of the Greatest Generation cited by this country, are now going to have diminished health care. And how are they going to do it? They’re not going to do it through the front door. They’re not going to say, We’re going to decrease this care for you transparently, openly. Oh, no. They’re going to do it through the backdoor, something called the Inde-pendent Payment Advisory Board that we’ve talked about before, the 15-mem-ber bureaucratic panel. Nonelected in-dividuals are going to have the power, under this law, to say, Dr. Smith, you can’t do that for Mrs. Jones. If you do it, we’re not going to pay you. That’s the coercive power of this government. That’s the coercive power that this Court today said is okay. Well, Mr. G RAVES , you and I both know that it’s not okay for us, and it’s not okay for the American people. And that’s why we stand here tonight, and we say with every ounce of our being that the election that occurred in 2008 may have written this in stone, but there are some sandblasters out there. And what we’re going to do between now and the first Tuesday in November is to make certain that the American people understand and appreciate that there are folks in this town who are fighting as hard as we can to uphold the rule of law, to uphold the Constitu- tion, and to adhere to those funda-mental principles, especially in health care—the principles of affordability and accessibility and quality and choices for the American people. The bad news was written today. The good news is that you can solve all of these challenges in health care without putting the Federal Government in charge of the thing. We’ve got the solu-tions. We’ve talked about them before. We’ll be going on the road now talking about them from now until November, because the American people want to know that there is somebody fighting for them in this town on their behalf. And we are. What we need from the American people is for them to stand up and say, No more. We will not tolerate a govern-ment that will reach into our lives and destroy quality health care in this country to the degree that the Court said it was okay to do today. I thank my friend for the wonderful work you are doing and for yielding me this time. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Georgia. Not only are you a physician—you are not here speaking on behalf of phy-sicians. You are here speaking on be-half of patients all across this country and defending them. And I appreciate the great fight that you are putting on and the resolve that you have for each of us, as you are leading us here as Re-publicans here in the House. As we go into the last 5 minutes here with the gentleman from Utah (Mr. B ISHOP ), he brought up the government right now taxes us on what we do or consume, but this is a first in which the government can now tax you on what you don’t do. That’s an amazing concept. I hadn’t really thought of it that way until Mr. P RICE brought it up. So now the Federal Government has moved into a realm which has never been here before, saying, Hey, because you’re not doing something, I’m going to tax you. So I’m going to determine what it is that you should be doing that you are not doing so, therefore, I can collect a little revenue. And here we are today with something such as this. As we are just wrapping up this spir- ited discussion here, earlier, Mr. B ISHOP , you heard the Progressives celebrating this decision today. What were they celebrating? The Federal Government can tax you if you do something. But today’s celebration was the fact that the Federal Govern-ment can tax you when you don’t do something. I appreciate you joining us tonight and giving your thoughts from the great State of Utah. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding me a few mo-ments here. Truly, this is a unique day. And I’m happy to join my colleagues in talking about this particular issue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4432 June 28, 2012 confused with constitutional prin- ciples. Today we had one case brought by States to the Supreme Court. And the administration has always said, This ObamaCare is not a tax. It is not a tax. Well, the Court said, on five of the nine decisions, Yes, it is a tax. And I guess it’s legal if you call it a tax. Four of the nine said not even that’s good enough; but, nonetheless, it’s a tax. b1920 It’s appropriate that we talk about that power of taxing because the most famous of all cases, McCulloch v. Maryland, which was one the major de-cisions actually made in this particular building, simply said the power to tax is the power to destroy. And we have that in front of us right now. I don’t think we should’ve expected judges to do what the legislative branch—in this case, Congress—ought do. And I think it’s positive that we move forward in this effort to make sure that this program does not go into effect and we take concerns for our constituents and maybe even learn something from it. The idea of judicial review didn’t exist for the first decade and a half of this country. Marbury v. Madison didn’t happen until almost 15 years into the country. Washington, in the Constitutional Convention, also thought the veto should be what deter-mined constitutionality, kind of execu-tive review, and Jefferson always said there should be legislative review. So I think perhaps our Founding Fa- thers thought all branches should be involved in that kind of concept. And I think there should be a fourth one added to it, which is the States at the same time, who started this process of going to the courts. But we don’t come on this floor often and quote anti-Fed-eralists because they lost. However, I want to today, because even though they were wrong on the Constitution, every once in a while they were right on some of the concepts. So in the ‘‘17th Letter from a Fed- eralist Farmer,’’ written either by Melancthon Smith or one of the Lees of Virginia—no one really knows who ac-tually did it—he talked about this idea that the States, if we have the concept of federalism, should have some power to do some real things. He simply said: I have often heard it observed that our peo- ple are well informed and will not submit to oppressive governments, that the State gov-ernments will be ready advocates. But of what avail will these circumstances be if the State governments, thus allowed to be guardians of the people, possess no kind of power to stop the laws of Congress injurious to the people? One of the things they quickly said is States really don’t have the concept or the power to actually involve them-selves in this particular issue. There are some concepts that are out there. The repeal amendment, which is pro-posed by some legal scholars and has been proposed by some State organiza-tions, would actually give a tool for States to be involved in this discussion because it impacts those States. Right now, they simply have to accept what takes place here in the rarified air by the Potomac River. But, indeed, if we gave the States a tool so if enough States were to ban to-gether to say, No, we disagree with this rule, we disagree with this regulation, we disagree with this law, we even dis-agree with this Supreme Court deci-sion, the States would have the ability to add a new check and a new balance to make sure that the common people of this country have some kind of voice in these decisions. I think one of the things we should learn from today’s decision is that we desperately need another check and balance in our process to make fed-eralism a realistic and real term, and that means to involve the States in giving them some powers to have real decisions, not so they have to come to us as they have so far, begging, but so they can actually have a say. I think we would be better off as a Nation if we did it. This decision today, if nothing more, should add a resolve for us to solve a political problem politically, to do it here in the Halls of Congress, but maybe add another player in this proc-ess—the States—so they also have a say in this power to tax, which is the power to destroy. I realize we’re coming close to time. I want to give my good friend from Georgia the chance of giving the final word on this particular issue, and I ap-preciate his efforts to organize this op-portunity to talk about what has hap-pened today. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Thank you for your comments tonight and your great insight and reflecting back on early documents and early words that have been shared. Mr. Speaker, as we conclude tonight, I want the American people to know that we are resolved to restore the lib-erty that was lost today through the full repeal of ObamaCare. That will be our focus as Republicans in the House. I yield back the balance of my time. f CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4348, MOVING AHEAD FOR PROGRESS IN THE 21ST CENTURY ACT Mr. MICA (during the Special Order of Mr. G RAVES of Georgia) submitted the following conference report and statement on the bill (H.R. 4348) to pro-vide an extension of Federal-aid high-way, highway safety, motor carrier safety, transit, and other programs funded out of the Highway Trust Fund pending enactment of a multiyear law reauthorizing such programs, and for other purposes: CONFERENCE REPORT (H.

JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE CONFERENCE The managers on the part of the Senate and the House at the conference on the dis-agreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill ( H.R. 4348), to provide an extension of Federal-aid highway, highway safety, motor carrier safe-ty, transit, and other programs funded out of the Highway Trust Fund pending enactment of a multiyear law reauthorizing such pro-grams, and for other purposes, submit the following joint statement to the House and the Senate in explanation of the effect of the action agreed upon by the managers and rec-ommended in the accompanying conference report: The House recedes from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate to the text of the bill and agrees to the same with an amendment. A summary of the bill agreed to in con- ference is set forth below: Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Cen- tury (MAP–21) replaces the previous author-ization, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Effi- cient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA–LU), that expired on September 30, 2009 and which has been con- tinued with a series of short-term exten-sions. MAP–21 will modernize and reform our current transportation system to help create jobs, accelerate economic recovery, and build the foundation for long-term pros-perity. This conference report makes a num-ber of necessary changes in the Federal-aid highway program structure to increase State flexibility and better serve the American people. DIVISION A—FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS AND HIGHWAY SAFETY CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS Highway funding levels The conference report provides funding for the federal-aid highway program through fis-cal 2014 at current funding levels with a small inflationary adjustment. Program consolidation The Senate and the House both sought to consolidate the number of programs in the federal-aid highway program to focus prior-ities and resources on key national goals. The conference report consolidates the num-ber of highway programs by two-thirds. The elimination of dozens of programs makes more resources available to States and met-ropolitan areas to invest in their most crit-ical needs to improve the condition and per-formance of their transportation system. Project delivery The conference report combined provisions from the House and Senate bills focusing on the shared priority of accelerating project delivery. It maintains the vast majority of project acceleration provisions from S. 1813 and provisions from the House bill in addi-tion to new provisions that will maintain substantive environment and public health protections while streamlining the creation and use of documents and environmental re-views, enhancing efficiency and account-ability in the project delivery process. The conference report adopts and modifies provisions from the House bill directing the Secretary to designate, through rulemaking, certain activities as categorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy Act. The Secretary is directed to designate the repair or reconstruction of a road, high-way, or bridge damaged by a declared emer-gency or disaster as a categorical exclusion, if the repair or reconstruction project is in the same location and with the same speci-fications as the original project and is com-menced within two years of the declaration of emergency or disaster. The Secretary is also directed to designate any project within the existing operational right-of-way as a categorical exclusion and defines the term ‘‘operational right-of-way’’. Additionally, the Secretary is directed to designate projects receiving limited Federal assistance as a categorical exclusion. The categorical exclusion applies to any project that re-ceives less than $5,000,000 in Federal funds and any project with a total estimated cost of not more than $30,000,000 receiving Federal funds comprising less than 15 percent of the total estimated project costs. Performance measures The nation’s surface transportation pro- grams have not provided sufficient account-ability for how tax dollars are being spent on transportation projects and would benefit from a greater focus on key national prior-ities. The conference report focuses the high-way program on key outcomes, such as re-ducing fatalities, improving road and bridge conditions, reducing congestion, increasing system reliability, and improving freight movement and economic vitality. Focus on the National Highway System The conference report combines the old interstate maintenance program into a new program called the National Highway Per- formance Program to address both the inter-state system as well as an extended National Highway System. It is these roads that are most critical to our economic vitality, and the conference report ensures the roads and bridges that make up this system will be bet-ter maintained. Freight policy A top priority of the nation’s transpor- tation system should be the safe and effi-cient movement of goods. The nation’s eco-nomic health is reliant upon a transpor-tation system that provides for reliable and timely goods movement. This conference report establishes policies to improve freight movement. It calls for the development of a National Freight Strategic Plan, encourages state freight plans and ad-visory committees, and provides incentives for states that fund projects to improve freight movement. America fast forward Given our massive investment needs and the limited funding available, we need to find ways to better leverage Federal dollars by encouraging additional non-Federal in-vestment and helping to accelerate the bene-fits of State and locally funded transpor-tation projects. This conference report builds upon the suc- cess of the TIFIA program to help commu-nities leverage their transportation re-sources and stretch Federal dollars further than they have been stretched before. The conference report modifies the TIFIA pro-gram by increasing funding for the program to $1 billion per year, by increasing the max-imum share of project costs from 33 percent to 49 percent, by allowing TIFIA to be used to support a related set of projects, and by setting aside funding for projects in rural areas at more favorable terms. Gulf Coast restoration The conference report modifies a Senate provision related to Gulf Coast restoration known as the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourism Opportunities and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act of 2012 (RESTORE Act). The provision establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund and places in the Trust Fund 80% of all civil penalties paid by responsible parties in connection with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Funding may be used to invest in projects and activities to restore the long- term health of the coastal ecosystem and local economies in the Gulf Coast Region, which includes the states of Mississippi, Lou-isiana, Alabama, Florida, and Texas. A por-tion of the funds will be allocated directly and equally to the five Gulf Coast states for ecological and economic recovery along the coast. A portion will be provided to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council estab-lished by the bill to develop and fund a com-prehensive plan for the restoration of Gulf Coast ecosystems. A portion will be allo-cated among the states using an impact- based formula to implement state plans that have been approved by the Council. Finally, a portion of the fines will be allocated to a Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration, science, observation, monitoring and technology pro-gram and for grants to nongovernmental en-tities for the establishment of Gulf Coast centers of excellence. Harbor maintenance The Conference report modifies a Senate provision highlighting the significance of the nation’s ports for efficient movement of goods and products and the need for in-creased investment in the maintenance of these ports to promote the economic competiveness of the United States. The pro-vision states the Sense of Congress that the VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00423 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4582 June 28, 2012 Administration should request and the Con- gress should fully expend each year all of the revenues collected in the Harbor Mainte-nance Trust Fund (HMTF) for the operation and maintenance of the nation’s federally maintained ports. The provision also ex-presses the importance of protecting other critical Army Corps programs, including in-land navigation, flood and coastal storm pro-tection, and ecosystem restoration, from funding reductions. Finally, the provision directs the Adminis- tration to provide an annual estimate of na-tional harbor maintenance needs, including an estimate of the percentage of waterways that will be available for use based on the annual budget request as well as how much funding would be needed to achieve 95 per-cent availability of the nation’s ports and waterways within 3 years DIVISION B—FEDERAL PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2012 The Federal Public Transportation Act of 2012 contains historic improvements in safe-ty oversight, streamlined review of new cap-ital projects, program consolidation, and a shift from earmarks and discretionary pro-grams to robust formula programs that pub-lic transportation systems can rely on to up-grade and improve aging infrastructure and vehicles. The Act provides increased funding levels for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 based on expected inflation, giving public transpor-tation providers the stable funding needed to make essential investments. Secs. 20005 and 20006, 49 U.S.C. 5303/5304, metro- politan and statewide transportation plan-ning The Conference report improves metropoli- tan and statewide planning processes to in-corporate a more comprehensive perform-ance-based approach. The conference com-mittee requires the structure of all Metro-politan Planning Organizations include offi-cials of public agencies that administer or operate public transportation systems with-in two years of enactment. The conference report creates a pilot pro- gram for transit-oriented development plan-ning to advance planning efforts that sup-port transit-oriented development around fixed guideway capital investment projects. Grants for planning will help communities develop strategies to facilitate transit-ori-ented development. Secs. 20007 and 20026, 49 U.S.C. 5307 and 5336, urbanized area formula grants Maintains the basic structure for urban- ized area grants under Section 5307. The pro-gram continues to be the largest program for federal investment in public transportation. The ‘‘Job Access and Reverse Commute’’ pro-gram (JARC) has been moved to Section 5307 and the conferees have removed the Senate bill set-aside for JARC activities. Maintains the existing criteria for use of 5307 funds for capital projects (operating ex-penses continue to be ineligible) in urban areas with a population greater than 200,000. In addition, the bill maintains language al-lowing small urbanized areas with popu-lations under 200,000 to use up to 100 percent of their 5307 funding for operating expenses. A modified ‘‘100 bus rule’’ has been included, allowing systems with 76–100 buses operating in peak service to use up to 50% of their 5307 funding for operating expenses and those op-erating 75 or fewer buses to use up to 75% for operating expenses. The Senate receded to the House request to remove a provision in the Senate bill estab-lishing a program to allow public transpor-tation providers temporary flexibility during periods of high unemployment to use a lim-ited portion of their 5307 funds for up to two years for operating expenses. Sec. 20008, 49 U.S.C. 5309, Fixed Guideway Cap- ital Investment Grants (new starts) Reforms and streamlines the ‘‘Fixed Guide- way Capital Investment Grant’’ program (previously the ‘‘Major Capital Investment Grant’’ or ‘‘New Starts’’ program). Based on extensive feedback from project sponsors and other stakeholders, the bill streamlines the New Starts process to accelerate project de-livery by eliminating duplicative steps in project development and instituting a modi-fied program structure that will allow the Federal Transit Administration to review proposals quickly, without sacrificing effec-tive project oversight. Projects under $100 million can utilize an expedited review process if they meet stand-ards of similar highly qualified projects. The bill also creates a category of demonstration projects for sponsors that propose a signifi-cant amount of local and/or private funding and reduce the federal commitment required for the projects. Establishes a new category for capital in- vestment projects by authorizing core capac-ity projects, which will undergo the same process as other ‘‘new starts’’ projects but provide an opportunity for existing systems to make necessary but significant invest-ments that were not previously eligible for funding. The conference report requires that eligible activities under a core capacity project achieve at least a 10% increase in ca-pacity along a corridor. The Senate agreed to a House request to modify the definition of Bus Rapid Transit projects in the Senate bill to allow broader use of the program. The conference report also includes incentives for the development of bus rapid transit projects that incorporate elements of fixed-guideway transit like light rail. Sec. 20009, 49 U.S.C. 5310, formula grants for the enhanced mobility of seniors and individ-uals with disabilities Consolidates the existing ‘‘Elderly and Dis- abled’’ (Sec. 5310) and ‘‘New Freedom’’ (Sec. 5317) programs into a single program that in-creases the level of resources available be-yond the level of funding available under ex-isting programs. The consolidated program will continue to ensure support for non-prof-it providers of transportation, and it will continue to make available funds for public transportation services that exceed the re-quirements of the Americans with Disabil-ities Act, as previously provided under the ‘‘New Freedom’’ program. Sec. 20010, 49 U.S.C. 5311, formula grants for rural areas Maintains the existing structure providing funding to states for public transportation in rural areas. The 5311 formula is expanded to include the rural component of the ‘‘Job Ac-cess and Reverse Commute’’ program, and the level of public transportation service that is provided within a state’s rural areas is considered in the distribution of new funds. Funding for the ‘‘Public Transportation on Indian Reservations’’ program is increased to $30 million. The Secretary will distribute $5 million competitively each fiscal year, and $25 million will be available to Indian Tribes as formula grants to continue and ex-pand public transportation services. The conference report also establishes a new ‘‘Appalachian Development Public Transportation Program’’ to distribute $20 million to states within the Appalachian re-gion with a goal of providing greater public transportation opportunities to residents in these challenged areas. Sec. 20011, 49 U.S.C. 5312, research, develop- ment, demonstration, and deployment projects Modifies the existing research program by eliminating earmarks and reforming the pro-gram to provide research focused on public transportation with a goal of providing meaningful results. Creates a clearly delineated pipeline with criteria for continued progress with a goal of taking an idea from the research phase through to demonstration and deployment in the field. For the first time, the program specifically provides funding for demonstra-tion and deployment of products and services that may benefit public transportation; a major impediment to putting new tech-nology to use in the field often cited by pub-lic transportation providers. Creates a section of the deployment pro- gram dedicated to low or no emission public transportation vehicles. Grants will be avail-able for the acquisition of low or no emission vehicles and related equipment, the con-struction of facilities for low or no emission vehicles, and the rehabilitation of existing facilities to accommodate the use of low or no emission vehicles. Sec. 20012, 49 U.S.C. 5314, technical assistance and standards development Provides grants for activities that help public transportation systems more effec-tively and efficiently provide public trans-portation service and helps grant recipients administer funds received under this chap-ter. Authorizes the Federal Transit Adminis-tration to continue making grants for the development of voluntary standards by the public transportation industry related to procurement, safety and other subjects and authorizes the Secretary to fund technical assistance centers to assist grant recipients following a competitive process. Sec. 20014, 49 U.S.C. 5318, bus testing facilities Instructs the Secretary to certify one fa- cility for testing new bus models. Requires the Secretary to work with the bus industry to develop a mutually agreed upon pass/fail test for vehicles to ensure the safety and re-liability of buses purchased with federal funds. Sec. 20015, 49 U.S.C. 5322, public transportation workforce development and human resource programs Authorizes the Secretary to make grants, or enter into contracts for, activities that address human resource and workforce needs as they apply to public transportation ac-tivities. Creates the Innovative Public Transportation Workforce Development Pro-gram, a competitive grant program to pro-mote and assist the development of innova-tive workforce development and human re-source activities within the public transpor-tation industry. Sec. 20017, 49 U.S.C. 5324, public transportation emergency relief program Establishes a program to assist States and public transportation systems pay for pro-tecting, repairing, or replacing equipment and facilities that are in danger of suffering serious damage or have suffered serious dam-age as a result of an emergency. Sec. 20019, 49 U.S.C. 5326, transit asset manage- ment Establishes a system to monitor and man- age public transportation assets to improve safety and increase reliability and perform-ance. Recipients are required to establish and use an asset management system to de-velop capital asset inventories and condition assessments, and report on the condition of their system as a whole, including a descrip-tion of the change in overall condition since the last report. The Secretary of Transpor-tation is also required to define the term ‘state of good repair,’ including objective standards for measuring the condition of capital assets.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4583 June 28, 2012 Sec. 20021, 49 U.S.C. 5329, public transportation safety program Establishes a National Public Transpor- tation Safety Plan to improve the safety of all public transportation systems that re-ceive Federal funding. The Secretary will de-velop minimum performance standards for vehicles used in public transportation and establish a training program for Federal and State employees who conduct safety audits and examinations of public transportation systems. Requires public transportation agencies to establish comprehensive safety plans, thus encouraging a ‘‘culture of safety’’ in which each employee completes a safety training program that includes continuing safety edu-cation and training. The Senate receded to a House request to give smaller systems the option to rely on states to prepare these plans. Improves the effectiveness of State Safety Oversight Agencies and increases federal funding for safety. States will submit pro-posals for state safety oversight programs for rail fixed guideway public transportation systems to the Secretary, and upon approval, receive funding at an 80 percent Federal share. The Act builds on the existence of State safety oversight agencies and requires them to be legally and financially inde-pendent from the rail fixed guideway sys-tems they oversee, and have the authority, staff training and expertise to enforce Fed-eral and state safety laws. At the request of the House the conference changes the nature of the enforcement pow-ers contained in the Senate bill. Instead of direct oversight of public transportation agencies, the program relies on State Safety Oversight Agencies to provide direct over-sight of rail fixed guideway public transpor-tation providers. Sec. 20027, 49 U.S.C. 5337, state of good repair grant program Modernizes, renames, and provides historic levels of funding for the old ‘‘Rail Mod-ernization’’ program by establishing a pro-gram structure and defining eligible ex-penses under the program with a goal of moving all systems towards a state of good repair and enabling systems to maintain a state of good repair. The program has two major components: a rail fixed guideway state of good repair for-mula program and a high intensity bus state of good repair formula program. Funding tiers and earmarks in the old rail moderniza-tion program have been eliminated and re-placed with a new structure that focuses on the age of the system, revenue vehicle miles and directional route miles. DIVISION C—TRANSPORTATION SAFETY AND SURFACE TRANSPORTATION POL-ICY T ITLE I—M OTOR VEHICLE AND HIGHWAY SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT Highway Safety Grant Programs. The con- ference report includes provisions that re-structure the existing highway safety grant programs administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The conference report largely re-flects the Senate approach on modifications to the existing formula grant programs, in-cluding the establishment of a single grant application and reporting process for all grants received under this title, the adoption of performance measures, and the establish-ment of planning and reporting requirements for the states. In addition, the conference re-port inserts a prohibition on state use of these formula grant funds to pay for red light or speed cameras. The report moves a provision establishing a cooperative research and evaluation program into a different sec-tion, but continues to fund it from the funds provided for the formula grant program. The conference report accepts the Senate approach on incentive grants, but consoli-dates all of those grants into a single section in Code. The new Section 405 of Title 23, ‘‘Na-tional Priority Safety Programs,’’ allocates funds across six incentive grant programs and allows such funds to be used for a re-search program on technology to prevent im-paired driving. The conference report retains the Senate language with respect to state traffic safety information system improve-ment grants, the motorcycle safety grant program, and the high visibility enforcement program. The conference report retains the Senate language with respect to an occupant protec-tion incentive grant with two modifications. First, the report provides the highest per-forming states with additional flexibility in spending grant funds. Second, the report does not specifically state that education to the public concerning the dangers of children left unattended in vehicles is an allowable use of these funds, however the conferees agree that such education efforts could be carried out under other allowable uses, in-cluding education to the public concerning the proper use of child restraints. The conference report reflects the Senate approach with regard to the impaired driving countermeasures and teen driver safety grants with one modification made to each that allows states additional flexibility in spending a percentage of funds received through these programs. The report also ac-cepts the Senate approach on distracted driving incentive grants, with one change to the eligibility requirements for the grants. Highway Safety Research. The conference report accepts the Senate approach to modi-fying the highway safety research authori-ties provided to NHTSA. The report strikes provisions in the Senate bill that authorized additional collaborative research and devel-opment with non-federal entities, allowed the Secretary to establish an international highway safety information and cooperation program, funded training for highway safety personnel, and created a clearinghouse for information about best practices for driver’s licensing concerning drivers with medical issues. The report removes language in the Senate bill that allowed NHTSA to develop model specifications for devices. The con-ferees understand the removal of this lan-guage does not alter the current authority of NHTSA in this area. The conference report modifies Senate lan- guage providing NHTSA with the authority to conduct research into advanced tech-nology to prevent impaired driving, and al-lows the Secretary to use funds from the Na-tional Priority Safety Programs to fund this research. Enhanced Safety Authorities. The con- ference report includes several provisions in-tended to enhance NHTSA’s safety authori-ties. The conference report revises the Sen-ate language on civil penalties and sets the maximum penalty at $35 million for a re-lated series of violations. The increase will take effect one year after enactment or when NHTSA issues a rule interpreting the new civil penalty factors, whichever is earlier, and the conferees agree that the new penalty amount will only be subject to adjustment for inflation occurring thereafter. The con-ference report maintains the Senate ap-proach on motor vehicle safety research and development with modification, including to NHTSA’s authority to plan, design, or build facilities. The conference report largely maintains the Senate approach providing NHTSA additional authority over imported motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment, though it strikes a provision related to fi-nancial responsibility requirements for im- porters and modifies a provision relating to conditions of importation. Transparency and Accountability. The conference report contains several provisions designed to increase transparency and ac-countability at NHTSA and in the auto in-dustry. The conference report adopts a modi-fied Senate approach on establishing public accessibility to vehicle recall information and further modifies Senate provisions ad-dressing the set of communications with dealers that must be made available to the public. The report strikes the provision re-garding public availability of early warning reporting data. The report strikes a provi-sion imposing new post-employment restric-tions for vehicle safety officials at NHTSA, but retains language calling on the inspector general to report on the issue. The report slightly modifies the whistleblower protec-tion provision and calls on the Government Accountability Office to examine this and other such provisions. The report slightly modifies the provision directing NHTSA to study crash data collection. And the report makes slight modifications to NHTSA’s au-thority to require additional recall notifica-tions. Vehicle Electronics and Safety Standards. The conference report maintains a Senate provision that establishes a Council for Vehi-cle Electronics, Vehicle Software, and Emerging Technologies to build, implement, and aggregate NHTSA’s expertise in pas-senger motor vehicle electronics and other new and emerging technologies. The con-ference report includes a provision calling on NHTSA to evaluate vehicle electronic sys-tems and report to Congress on highest pri-ority areas for safety. The conference report strikes all other safety mandates contained in Subtitle D of the Senate bill. Child Safety Standards. The conference re- port maintains the Senate approach with re-gard to child safety. The report strikes man-dates for new safety standards for booster seats and child restraint anchorage systems because conferees understand that NHTSA has completed a rulemaking that achieves these goals. The report modifies the mandate that NHTSA update its frontal impact test parameters for child safety seats to clarify that the mandate only applies to the seat as-sembly specifications. The report revises the provision relating to unattended passengers to a discretionary research effort without any mandate for NHTSA to begin a rule-making process. Improved Daytime and Nighttime Visi- bility of Agricultural Equipment. The Con-ference report accepts the Senate language. T ITLE II—C OMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2012 Commercial Motor Vehicle Registration requirements. The conference report in-cludes several provisions amending registra-tion requirements under federal law for com-mercial motor vehicles (CMV), freight for-warders, and brokers. The conference report largely adopts the Senate registration provi-sions. The provisions include new require-ments, such as completing a written exam-ination and applying for a US DOT number, as a precondition for being registered. The included provisions amend safety fitness re-quirements and require license holders to provide registration updates. The conference report also includes Senate provisions for registering household goods motor carriers, but removes provisions directing the Sec-retary to establish education and assistance programs to address the problems of house-hold property being held hostage. The conference report makes changes to some Senate registration provisions. It re-tains the current presumption in favor of VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00425 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4584 June 28, 2012 registration, removes a management plan re- quirement, and changes written examination provisions. For providers of motorcoach services, the conference report also replaces a pre-authorization audit requirement with a requirement that new operators undergo a safety review within 120 days of beginning operations. The conference report also re-moves requirements to periodically update registration information when no changes have been made. The conference report includes a number of Senate provisions to address motor carrier companies that mask prior noncompliance and adverse safety history. The provisions authorize the Secretary to withhold, sus-pend, amend, or revoke a motor carrier’s reg-istration if the carrier failed to disclose an adverse safety history or other facts relevant to its past regulatory compliance. The provi-sions authorize similar action where the Sec-retary finds that within the previous 3 years the carrier: (1) was closely related to another motor carrier with a poor compliance his-tory; and (2) did not disclose this relation-ship in its application. The Secretary is granted authority to refuse or revoke a USDOT number to an applicant that is unfit, unwilling or unable to comply with the safe-ty regulations. The conference report amends some of the Senate provisions to limit the unintended results of punishing in-dividuals who were not guilty parties in pre-vious companies. The conference report adopts several Sen- ate penalty provisions for operations in vio-lation of registration requirements. The con-ference report includes civil penalties and revocation authority for operating without registration, operating as imminent hazard, and transporting hazardous wastes without necessary registration. Provisions increase the civil penalties for motor carriers, motor carriers of migrant workers and private motor carriers that disobey a subpoena or a requirement of the Secretary to produce wit-nesses or records. Other provisions included authorize the Secretary to suspend, amend or revoke the registration of a motor carrier, broker or freight forwarder for failing to obey an administrative subpoena. Another provision authorizes the Secretary to place out of service the operations of a motor car-rier discovered to be operating vehicles with-out the required registration, or operating beyond the scope of the registration granted. The conference report amends the Senate provision for hazardous waste transportation penalties and sets the penalty range at not less than $20,000 but not to exceed $40,000. Electronic logging devices. The conference report includes provisions directing the Sec-retary to issue regulations requiring elec-tronic logging devices for recording hours of service in commercial motor vehicles and sets basic performance standards for the de-vice. The conference report adopted the Sen-ate approach with some amendments. The conference report adds an hours of service field study to expand on a previous Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) report on driver fatigue and max-imum driving time requirements focusing on the 34-hour restart rule. The conference re-port directs the Secretary, in prescribing regulations, to consider how the rule may re-duce or eliminate requirements for drivers and motor carriers to retain supporting doc-umentation associated with paper-based records. The conference report changes the name of the device and adds other language to make clear that the devices are to be used only to enforce federal regulations. The re-port also includes a definition of ‘‘tamper re-sistant’’ and provisions to ensure that appro-priate measures are taken to protect the pri-vacy of individuals and the confidentiality of the data. Commercial motor vehicle driver safety. The conference report includes several Sen-ate provisions to address commercial driver safety: driver medical qualifications, oper-ator training, driver’s license program, driv-er’s requirements and driver information systems. The conference report removes a Senate provision that would have directed the development of driver safety fitness rat-ings. The report also removes a study and re-port to Congress examining the extent to which detention time contributes to drivers violating hours of service requirements and driver fatigue. The conference report re-moves a Senate provision that would have amended the membership of the Motor Car-rier Safety Advisory Committee to specifi-cally include non-profit employee organiza- tion representation. The provisions included direct the Sec- retary to establish a national registry of medical examiners, issue regulations to es-tablish minimum entry-level training re-quirements for all CMV operators, require States to modernize commercial driver’s li-cense (CDL) information systems, and add disqualification standards for drivers. The conference report includes Senate provisions for the commercial driver’s license program, but removes language for federal guidance on critical requirements for effective State CDL programs. The conference report in-cludes alternate language directing states to prioritize areas that the Secretary has iden-tified as critical in the most recent audit of their programs. The conference report also includes lan- guage for streamlining the process by which military members and veterans who operate heavy trucks during duty are able to obtain commercial driver’s licenses. The conference provision includes Senate language directing the Secretary to complete a study and report to Congress on what can be done to stream-line the process. The report adds new lan-guage requiring the Secretary, based on rec-ommendations of the report, to establish ac-celerated licensing procedures within 1 year of enactment. Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse. The con- ference report includes Senate provisions di-recting the Secretary to establish a national repository for records relating to alcohol and controlled substances testing of CMV driv-ers. The records will be used to determine the qualifications for operating a CMV. The clearinghouse will include safeguards to pro-tect the privacy of individuals to whom the information pertains and ensure that the in-formation is not divulged to anyone not di-rectly involved in evaluating the individual’s qualifications to drive a CMV. The con-ference report also includes Senate provi-sions for prohibiting an employer from hir-ing a driver unless he or she has determined that during the preceding three years that such driver: did not test positive in violation of the regulations at title 49, Code of Federal Regulations; and did not refuse a test under these regulations. Other included provisions grant preemption authority to the Secretary in regard to the reporting of valid positive results or refusals to take alcohol screening and drug tests, and apply civil penalties to any violators of privacy and reporting re-quirements. The conference report amends Senate pro- visions for archiving personal records to en-sure further individual privacy protections. The conference report also includes amend-ments to the National Transportation Safety Board’s access to clearinghouse records. The conference report makes amendments to clarify that the clearinghouse will be used to determine whether individuals have existing employment prohibitions at the time of making hiring decisions. Motor Carrier Grant programs. The con- ference report does not include Senate provi-sions updating and consolidating grant pro- grams and processes. While the conference believes that reducing administrative bur-dens on the states and local governments by streamlining grants processes is beneficial, the short time frame of the legislation does not allow for these changes. In that regard, the conference agrees to retain existing grant programs and authorizes them for FY 2013 and FY 2014 at current funding levels. The conference report adds language allow-ing the Secretary to examine methods and approaches for streamlining grants adminis-tration and processes to reduce burdens for the states and local governments. The con-ference report makes some administrative amendments to the existing commercial driver license program improvement grant that was included in the Senate bill. The conference also retains the Senate provision requiring a report to Congress on resuming the commercial vehicle information systems and networks program. Motorcoach Safety. The conference report includes provisions addressing the safety of motorcoach operations. The conference adopts the Senate approach, but modifies some rulemaking and research requirements and removes registration provisions. The conference report consolidates several re-search and rulemakings related to fire pre-vention and mitigation. The report amends language on assessing the feasibility of ret-rofitting existing motorcoaches with safety requirements. The report makes conforming definition changes regarding the registration of motorcoaches. The registration provisions were not included in the conference report because they are largely redundant to the provisions in the report updating registra-tion requirements for all motor carriers. The conference report also includes a Sen- ate provision for oversight of motorcoaches. The provision directs the Secretary to estab-lish a safety fitness system to rate motor coaches, determine and assign a fitness rat-ing for each motor coach, periodically review the safety ratings and make public the fit-ness ratings of each motorcoach. The conference report includes a new pro- vision that directs the Secretary, to the ex-tent feasible, to ensure that motorcoach re-search programs and rulemaking are carried out concurrently. The report also includes a provision requiring the Secretary to review and report to Congress on the current knowl-edge and skill testing requirements for a commercial driver’s license passenger en-dorsement. The conference agreement re-moves a Senate rulemaking requirement on distracted driving because FMCSA has al-ready addressed this issue. Truck, Size and Weight. The conference re- port includes provisions directing the Sec-retary to study the effects of truck, size and weight on highway safety and infrastructure and compile a list of existing state truck size and weight laws. The conference report amends the Senate study provisions. The conference report includes language direct-ing the Secretary to consider the effects of trucks operating in excess of federal law and regulations in comparison to those trucks that do not operate in excess of federal law and regulations, when assessing accident fre-quency and impacts to highway and bridge infrastructure. The conference report adopts the Senate requirement that the report must be submitted to Congress not later than 2 years after enactment. Financial responsibility requirements. The conference report includes provisions ad-dressing the financial responsibility of freight-forwarders and brokers. These provi-sions direct rulemakings to establish min-imum financial solvency and bonding re-quirements for these entities. The con-ference agreement includes exemptions for VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00426 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4585 June 28, 2012 air carrier and customs brokers who are al- ready subject to financial responsibility re-quirements under federal law. Enforcement. The Senate bill included sev- eral provisions amending and updating FMCSA’s enforcement authorities. The con-ference report includes nine of the Senate provisions. Five of the Senate enforcement provisions were not included in the con-ference report: minimum prohibition on op-eration of unfit carriers, minimum out of service penalties, failure to pay civil penalty as a disqualifying offense, intrastate oper-ations of interstate motor carriers and en-forcement of safety laws and regulations. Exemptions. The conference report amends an exemption for the transportation of agri-cultural commodities by increasing the per-mitted travel radius from 100 air-miles to 150 air-miles. The conference report includes Senate language for a narrow exemption from federal requirements for covered farm vehicles. This conference report adopts the Senate language directing the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the safety impacts of the covered farm vehicle exemp-tion. T ITLE III—S URFACE TRANSPORTATION AND FREIGHT POLICY ACT OF 2012 The Senate legislation included provisions establishing a comprehensive national sur-face transportation system and freight transportation policy. The policy would have provided certainty to states and localities by requiring the development of long term, strategic plans and directing transportation investment data collection and evaluation efforts. This Senate title had included provi-sions for safety standards to ensure that the design of federal transportation projects pro-vides for adequate consideration of non-mo-torized users. The conference report does not include this title. T ITLE IV—H AZARDOUS MATERIALS TRANSPOR - TATION SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2012 Training Programs. There is currently no uniform training standard for hazardous ma-terials (‘‘hazmat’’) inspectors and investiga-tors. The conference bill requires the Sec-retary to establish standards for training these inspectors and investigators. The con-ference report modifies the Senate bill to re-quire that the standards be developed not later than 18 months after enactment, and to clarify that the standards are established as guidelines. The conference report includes Senate pro- visions that amend training requirements for emergency responders of hazardous mate-rials. These provisions direct that organiza-tions receiving grant funding to train emer-gency responders have the ability to protect against accidents or incidents involving the transportation of hazardous material in ac-cordance with existing regulations and standards. The conference report adds language to permit ‘‘portable training’’ which can be of-fered in any suitable setting rather than spe-cific, designated facilities. This provision is included to allow training at locations and times convenient to students and instruc-tors. The conference report also adds re-quirements to ensure that the emergency re-sponder and hazmat employee training grants be awarded through a competitive process. Data Collection and Research. The Senate bill recognized the need for increased re-search and data collection on hazardous ma-terials programs and included a new pilot program for paperless hazard communica-tions. The program would permit the Sec-retary to conduct pilot projects to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using paperless hazard communications systems. The conference report includes these provi-sions and adds a requirement to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the pilot projects and submit recommendations on the analysis and other findings in the report to Congress. The conference report includes Senate pro- visions requiring an assessment of the Pipe-line and Hazardous Materials Safety Admin-istration’s (PHMSA) hazmat data collection, analysis and reporting. These provisions re-quire PHMSA to develop an action plan and timeline to make improvements to its sys-tems. The conference report directs PHMSA to conduct the assessment in consultation with Commandant of the Coast Guard, in lieu of in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security. This amendment was in-cluded because the Coast Guard is more spe-cifically involved in handling accidents and investigations in the transportation of haz-ardous materials. Hazmat Transportation. The conference re- port includes a new requirement for the Sec-retary to study the safety of transporting flammable liquids in the external pipes of cargo tanks, ‘‘wetlines.’’ The report specifies that the Secretary may not issue a rule-making on ‘‘wetlines’’ until the study is complete, but no later than two years after the date of enactment. The conference report also modifies Senate provisions that direct the Secretary to address transportation of perishable material after inspection, train-ing for inspectors and the proper closing of packaging after inspections, by requiring that these regulations be issued within a year after enactment. The Senate bill included a provision that requires uniform regulations for the safe loading and unloading of hazardous mate-rials on and off tank cars and cargo tank trucks. The provision was not included in the conference report due to an ongoing rule-making addressing the matter. The conference report includes a Senate provision that ensures States update the hazardous materials route registry kept by the Department of Transportation. Special permitting. The conference report amends provisions included in the Senate bill on special permits. The conference re-port removes some language regarding cri-teria for special permits but includes the rulemaking provision for special permit and approvals procedures. It directs a review and analysis of special permits that have been in continuous effect for a 10-year period to de-termine which permits can be converted into the hazardous materials regulations (HMR). It includes factors that the Secretary may consider in reviewing special permits. After the analysis is complete, but no later than 3 years after enactment, the report authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations for incor-porating special permits into the HMR. The amended language also directs the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register justifica-tion in the case of special permits that are not appropriate for incorporation into the HMR. Similarly, the amended language in-cludes a process to review a special permit for incorporation into the regulations once that permit has been in effect for 10 years. Motor carrier safety permits. The con- ference report includes a provision directing the Secretary to conduct a review of the im-plementation of the hazardous material safe-ty permit program. The conference report di-rects the Secretary to consider factors, in-cluding the list of hazardous materials re-quiring a safety permit, the criteria used by PHMSA to determine whether a hazardous material safety permit issued by a State is equivalent to the Federal permit, and ac- tions to improve the program including an additional level of fitness review. Based on the findings of the review, the Secretary may either issue a rulemaking to make any necessary improvements to the program, or publish in the Federal Register justification for why a rulemaking is not necessary. Civil penalties. The conference report adds new language amending civil penalties by re-moving the minimum penalty amount for violations of hazardous materials laws and regulations. The conference report also adds language amending penalties for training violations. It includes a definition of ‘‘ob-struct’’ regarding penalties for obstruction of inspections and investigations. T ITLE V—N ATIONAL RAILSYSTEM PRESERVA - TION, EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2012 The Senate legislation included provisions that would direct the Secretary, in collabo-ration with stakeholders, to develop a long- range, national rail plan. Other provisions in this title would amend statutory require-ments for implementation of positive train control, refine Surface Transportation Board authorities and amend and update Amtrak’s environmental review, capital planning and financing, and inspector general authorities. The conference report does not include any of the provisions in this title. T ITLE VI—S PORT FISHRESTORATION AND RECREATIONAL BOATING SAFETY ACT OF 2012 Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund. The conference report adopts Senate provisions to authorize appropriations and amounts for administrative costs through FY 2013 for the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund. The Trust Fund, often referred to as Wallop-Breaux, is the main-stay of funding for State and Federal sport fish conservation and recreational boating safety programs. Funds go to projects that support sport fish conservation and habitat conservation in the States, and to assist States in establishing and maintaining rec-reational boating safety and boater edu-cation programs. The Trust Fund receives income from the following five sources: (1) motorboat fuel taxes; (2) annual tax receipts from small engine fuel used for outdoor power equipment; (3) a manufacturers’ excise tax on sport fishing equipment; (4) import duties on fishing tackle and on yachts and pleasure craft; and (5) interest on funds in-vested prior to disbursal. All moneys re-ceived in a given fiscal year are apportioned to the States in the following fiscal year. T ITLE VII—M ISCELLANEOUS Overflights in Grand Canyon National Park. The conference report makes amend-ments to a Senate provision on aircraft noise abatement at Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP). The provision establishes standards to be used by the National Park Service (NPS) in restoring natural quiet at GCNP, defines the term ‘‘substantial restoration of natural quiet’’ for the park, and directs the NPS to take measures that promote adop-tion of quiet technology aircraft at GCNP. Commercial air tour operations. The con- ference report amends a Senate provision for commercial air tour operations at national parks. The report modifies existing statu-tory authority to clarify the conditions under which the Director of the NPS may deny an application to begin or expand com-mercial air tour operations without devel-oping an air tour management plan at Crater Lake National Park and Great Smoky Moun-tains National Park only.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4586 June 28, 2012 1Except where otherwise stated, all section ref- erences are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’). 2This portion of the tax rates was enacted as a def- icit reduction measure in 1993. Receipts from it were retained in the General Fund until 1997 legislation provided for their transfer to the Highway Trust Fund. 3Secs. 4081(a)(2)(A)(i), 4081(a)(2)(A)(iii), 4041(a)(2), 4041(a)(3), and 4041(m). Some of these fuels also are subject to an additional 0.1-cent-per-gallon excise tax to fund the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund (secs. 4041(d) and 4081(a)(2)(B)). 5Sec. 4051. 6Sec. 4071. 7Sec. 4481. 8Sec. 4482(c)(4) and (d). 9Sec. 9503. The Highway Trust Fund statutory pro- visions were placed in the Internal Revenue Code in 1982. 10Sec. 9503(e)(1). 11The authorizing Acts that currently are ref- erenced in the Highway Trust Fund provisions of the Code are: the Highway Revenue Act of 1956; Titles I and II of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982; the Surface Transportation and Uniform Re-location Act of 1987; the Intermodal Surface Trans-portation Efficiency Act of 1991; the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, the Surface Trans-portation Extension Act of 2003, the Surface Trans-portation Extension Act of 2004; the Surface Trans-portation Extension Act of 2004, Part II; the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2004, Part III; the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2004, Part IV; the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2004, Part V; the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Effi-cient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users; the SAFETEA–LU Technical Corrections Act of 2008; the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2010; the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2010, Part II; the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2011; the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2011, Part II, and the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012. 12Sec. 9503(b)(1). 13The provision also replaces cross-references to the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2011, Part II, with MAP–21, and replaces April 1, 2012 ref-erences with October 1, 2013 in the Code provisions governing the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund, and the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund. 14The Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund financing rate of 0.1 cent per gallon also is ex-tended through September 30, 2015. 15The Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund financing rate also is extended through Sep- tember 30, 2016. The provision also corrects a poten-tial drafting ambiguity regarding the taxable period as reflected in prior legislation. The provision is ef-fective as if included in section 142 of the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2011, Part II. PART I—EXTENSION OF HIGHWAY TRUST FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY AND RELATED TAXES A. Extension of Highway Trust Fund Expend- iture Authority and Extension of Highway- Related Taxes (secs. 141 and 142 of the House bill, secs. 40101 and 40102 of the Senate amendment, secs. 40101 and 40102 of the conference agree-ment, and secs. 4041, 4051, 4071, 4081, 4221, 4481 4483, 6412, 9503, 9504, and 9508 of the Code) 1 PRESENT LAW HIGHWAY TRUST FUND EXCISE TAXES In general Six separate excise taxes are imposed to fi- nance the Federal Highway Trust Fund pro-gram. Three of these taxes are imposed on highway motor fuels. The remaining three are a retail sales tax on heavy highway vehi-cles, a manufacturers’ excise tax on heavy vehicle tires, and an annual use tax on heavy vehicles. A substantial majority of the reve-nues produced by the Highway Trust Fund excise taxes are derived from the taxes on motor fuels. The annual use tax on heavy ve-hicles expires October 1, 2013. Except for 4.3 cents per gallon of the Highway Trust Fund fuels tax rates, the remaining taxes are scheduled to expire after June 30, 2012. The 4.3-cents-per-gallon portion of the fuels tax rates is permanent. 2The six taxes are sum- marized below. Highway motor fuels taxes The Highway Trust Fund motor fuels tax rates are as follows:3 Gasoline ......................... 18.3 cents per gallon Diesel fuel and kerosene 24.3 cents per gallon Alternative fuels ............ 18.3 or 24.3 cents per gallon generally 4 4See secs. 4041(a)(2), 4041(a)(3), and 4041(m). Non-fuel highway trust fund excise taxes In addition to the highway motor fuels ex- cise tax revenues, the Highway Trust Fund receives revenues produced by three excise taxes imposed exclusively on heavy highway vehicles or tires. These taxes are: A 12-percent excise tax imposed on the first retail sale of heavy highway vehicles, tractors, and trailers (generally, trucks hav-ing a gross vehicle weight in excess of 33,000 pounds and trailers having such a weight in excess of 26,000 pounds); 5 An excise tax imposed on highway tires with a rated load capacity exceeding 3,500 pounds, generally at a rate of 0.945 cents per 10 pounds of excess; 6and An annual use tax imposed on highway vehicles having a taxable gross weight of 55,000 pounds or more. 7(The maximum rate for this tax is $550 per year, imposed on vehi-cles having a taxable gross weight over 75,000 pounds.) The taxable year for the annual use tax is from July 1st through June 30th of the fol-lowing year. For the period July 1, 2013, through September 30, 2013, the amount of the annual use tax is reduced by 75 percent. 8 PRESENT LAW HIGHWAY TRUST FUND EXPENDITURE PROVISIONS In general Under present law, revenues from the high- way excise taxes, as imposed through June 30, 2012, generally are dedicated to the High-way Trust Fund. Dedication of excise tax revenues to the Highway Trust Fund and ex-penditures from the Highway Trust Fund are governed by the Code. 9The Code authorizes expenditures (subject to appropriations) from the Highway Trust Fund through June 30, 2012, for the purposes provided in author-izing legislation, as such legislation was in effect on the date of enactment of the Sur-face Transportation Extension Act of 2012. Highway Trust Fund expenditure purposes The Highway Trust Fund has a separate account for mass transit, the Mass Transit Account. 10The Highway Trust Fund and the Mass Transit Account are funding sources for specific programs. Highway Trust Fund expenditure purposes have been revised with each authorization Act enacted since establishment of the High-way Trust Fund in 1956. In general, expendi-tures authorized under those Acts (as the Acts were in effect on the date of enactment of the most recent such authorizing Act) are specified by the Code as Highway Trust Fund expenditure purposes. 11The Code provides that the authority to make expenditures from the Highway Trust Fund expires after June 30, 2012. Thus, no Highway Trust Fund expenditures may occur after June 30, 2012, without an amendment to the Code. As noted above, section 9503 appropriates to the Highway Trust Fund amounts equiva-lent to the taxes received from the following: the taxes on diesel, gasoline, kerosene and special motor fuel, the tax on tires, the an-nual heavy vehicle use tax, and the tax on the retail sale of heavy trucks and trailers. 12 Section 9601 provides that amounts appro-priated to a trust fund pursuant to sections 9501 through 9511, are to be transferred at least monthly from the General Fund of the Treasury to such trust fund on the basis of estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury of the amounts referred to in the Code section appropriating the amounts to such trust fund. The Code requires that prop-er adjustments be made in amounts subse-quently transferred to the extent prior esti-mates were in excess of, or less than, the amounts required to be transferred. HOUSE BILL Present-law expenditure authority and taxes are extended for an additional three months, through September 30, 2012. Effective date. —The provision is effective July 1, 2012. SENATE AMENDMENT The expenditure authority for the Highway Trust Fund is extended through September 30, 2013. The Code provisions governing the purposes for which monies in the Highway Trust Fund may be spent are updated to in-clude the reauthorization bill, Moving Ahead for Progress for the 21st Century (MAP–21). 13 The provision extends the motor fuel taxes, and all three non-fuel excise taxes at their current rates through September 30, 2015. 14The provision resolves the projected deficit in the Highway Trust Fund, assures a cushion of $2.8 billion in each account of the Highway Trust Fund, and creates a solvency account available for use by either highways or mass transit. Specifically, the Secretary of the Treasury is to transfer the excess of (1) any amount appropriated to the Highway Trust Fund before October 1, 2013, by reason of the provisions of this bill, over (2) the amount necessary to meet the required ex-penditures from the Highway Trust Fund as authorized in section 9503(c) of the Code (which provides expenditure authority from the Highway Trust Fund) for the period end-ing before October 1, 2013. Amounts in the solvency account are available for transfers to the Highway Account and the Mass Tran-sit Account in such amounts as determined necessary by the Secretary to ensure that each account has a surplus balance of $2.8 billion on September 30, 2013. The solvency account terminates on September 30, 2013 and any remainder in the solvency account remains in the Highway Trust Fund. The Committee expects that the Secretary of the Treasury will consult with the Secretary of Transportation in making determinations concerning amounts necessary to meet re-quired expenditures and amounts necessary to ensure the cushion of $2.8 billion. Effective date. —The provision is effective on April 1, 2012. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement provides for ex- penditure authority through September 30, The Code provisions governing the pur-poses for which monies in the Highway Trust Fund may be spent are updated to include the conference agreement bill, MAP–21. Cross-references to the reauthorization bill in the Code provisions governing the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund are also updated to include the conference agreement bill. In general, the provision ex-tends the taxes dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund at their present law rates through September 30, 2016, and for the heavy vehicle use tax, through September 30, 2017. 15 Effective date. —The provision is effective July 1, 2012.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4587 June 28, 2012 16Secs. 4041, 4042, and 4081. 17For Federal budget scorekeeping purposes, the LUST Trust Fund tax, like other excise taxes dedi-cated to trust funds, is assumed to be permanent. 18Pub. L. No. 109–58. 19As noted above, the Leaking Underground Stor- age Tank Trust Fund financing rate of 0.1 cent per gallon is also extended through September 30, 2015. 20Sec. 412. A number of exceptions to the min- imum funding rules apply. For example, govern-mental plans (within the meaning of section 414(d) and church plans (within the meaning of section 414(e)) are generally not subject to the minimum funding rules. Under section 4971, an excise tax ap-plies to an employer maintaining a single-employer plan if the minimum funding requirements are not satisfied. 21Sec. 302 of ERISA. 22Pub. L. No. 109–280. The PPA minimum funding rules for single-employer plans are generally effec-tive for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007. Delayed effective dates apply to single-employer plans sponsored by certain large defense contrac-tors, multiple-employer plans of some rural coopera-tives, eligible charity plans, and single-employer plans affected by settlement agreements with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Subsequent changes to the single-employer plan and multiem-ployer plan funding rules (including temporary fund-ing relief) were made by the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 (‘‘WRERA’’), Pub. L. No. 110–458, and the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 (‘‘PRA 2010’’), Public Law 111–192. 23The value of plan assets is generally reduced by any prefunding balance or funding standard carry-over balance in determining minimum required con-tributions, including for this purpose. A prefunding balance results from contributions to a plan that ex-ceed the minimum required contributions. A funding standard carryover balance results from a positive balance in the funding standard account that ap-plied under the funding requirements in effect before PPA. Subject to certain conditions, a prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance may be credited against the minimum required contribu-tion for a year, reducing the amount that must be contributed. 24If the plan has obtained a waiver of the min- imum required contribution (a funding waiver) with-in the past five years, the minimum required con-tribution also includes the related waiver amortiza-tion charge, that is, the annual installment needed to amortize the waived amount in level installments over the five years following the year of the waiver. 25If the value of plan assets, reduced only by any prefunding balance if the employer elects to apply the prefunding balance against the required con-tribution for the plan year, is at least equal to the plan’s funding target, no shortfall amortization base is established for the year. 26Under PRA 2010, employers were permitted to elect to use one of two alternative extended amorti-zation schedules for up to two ‘‘eligible’’ plan years during the period 2008–2011. The use of an extended amortization schedule has the effect of reducing the amount of the shortfall amortization installments attributable to the shortfall amortization base for the eligible plan year. However, the shortfall amor-tization installments attributable to an eligible plan year may be increased by an additional amount, an ‘‘installment acceleration amount,’’ in the case of employee compensation exceeding $1 million, ex-traordinary dividends, or stock redemptions within a certain period of the eligible plan year. PART II—REVENUE PROVISIONS A. Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund (secs. 40301 and 40302 of the Senate amend- ment, sec. 40201 of the conference agree-ment and secs. 9503 and 9508 of the Code) PRESENT LAW Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund financing rate Fuels of a type subject to other trust fund excise taxes generally are subject to an add- on excise tax of 0.1-cent-per-gallon to fund the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (‘‘LUST’’) Trust Fund. 16For example, the LUST excise tax applies to gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, and most alternative fuels subject to highway and aviation fuels excise taxes, and to fuels subject to the inland wa-terways fuel excise tax. This excise tax is imposed on both uses and parties subject to the other taxes, and to situations (other than export) in which the fuel otherwise is tax-exempt. For example, off-highway busi-ness use of gasoline and off-highway use of diesel fuel and kerosene generally are ex-empt from highway motor fuels excise tax. Similarly, States and local governments and certain other parties are exempt from such tax. Nonetheless, all such uses and parties are subject to the 0.1-cent-per-gallon LUST excise tax. Liquefied natural gas, compressed natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas are exempt from the LUST tax. Additionally, methanol and ethanol fuels produced from coal (includ-ing peat) are taxed at a reduced rate of 0.05 cents per gallon. The LUST tax is scheduled to expire after June 30, 2012. 17 Overview of Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund expenditure provisions Amounts in the LUST Trust Fund are available, as provided in appropriations Acts, for purposes of making expenditures to carry out sections 9003(h)–(j), 9004(f), 9005(c), and 9010–9013 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as in effect on the date of enactment of Public Law 109–168. Any claim filed against the LUST Trust Fund may be paid only out of such fund, and the liability of the United States for claims is limited to the amount in the fund. The monies in the LUST Trust Fund are used to pay expenses incurred by the Envi-ronmental Protection Agency (the ‘‘EPA’’) and the States for preventing, detecting, and cleaning up leaks from petroleum under-ground storage tanks, as well as programs to evaluate the compatibility of fuel storage tanks with alternative fuels, MTBE addi-tives, and ethanol and biodiesel blends. The EPA makes grants to States to imple- ment the program, and States use cleanup funds primarily to oversee and enforce cor-rective actions by responsible parties. States and EPA also use cleanup funds to conduct corrective actions where no responsible party has been identified, where a respon-sible party fails to comply with a cleanup order, in the event of an emergency, and to take cost recovery actions against parties. In 2005, Congress authorized the EPA and States to use trust fund monies for non- cleanup purposes as well, specifically for ad-ministration and enforcement of the leak prevention requirements of the UST pro-gram. 18 HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The provision transfers $3 billion from the LUST Trust Fund to the Highway Trust Fund. The provision also provides that 0.033 cent of the 0.1 cent LUST Trust Fund financ-ing rate is dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund. 19 Effective date. —The provision is effective on the date of enactment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement transfers $2.4 billion from the LUST Trust Fund to the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund. The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision to transfer 0.033 cent of the 0.1 cent LUST Trust Fund fi-nancing rate to the Highway Trust Fund. Effective date. —The provision is effective on the date of enactment. B. Pension Funding Stabilization (sec. 40312 of the Senate amendment, sec. 40211 of the conference agreement, Code sec. 430, and ERISA secs. 101(f) and 303) PRESENT LAW Minimum funding rules Defined benefit plans generally are subject to minimum funding rules that require the sponsoring employer generally to make a contribution for each plan year to fund plan benefits. 20Parallel rules apply under the Em- ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (‘‘ERISA’’), which is generally in the ju-risdiction of the Department of Labor. 21The minimum funding rules for single-employer defined benefit plans were substantially re-vised by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (‘‘PPA’’). 22 Minimum required contributions In general The minimum required contribution for a plan year for a single-employer defined ben-efit plan generally depends on a comparison of the value of the plan’s assets, reduced by any prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance (‘‘net value of plan as-sets’’), 23with the plan’s funding target and target normal cost. The plan’s funding tar- get for a plan year is the present value of all benefits accrued or earned as of the begin-ning of the plan year. A plan’s target normal cost for a plan year is generally the present value of benefits expected to accrue or to be earned during the plan year. If the net value of plan assets is less than the plan’s funding target, so that the plan has a funding shortfall (discussed further below), the minimum required contribution is the sum of the plan’s target normal cost and the shortfall amortization charge for the plan year (determined as described below). 24 If the net value of plan assets is equal to or exceeds the plan’s funding target, the min-imum required contribution is the plan’s tar-get normal cost, reduced by the amount, if any, by which the net value of plan assets exceeds the plan’s funding target. Shortfall amortization charge The shortfall amortization charge for a plan year is the sum of the annual shortfall amortization installments attributable to the shortfall bases for that plan year and the six previous plan years. Generally, if a plan has a funding shortfall for the plan year, a shortfall amortization base must be estab-lished for the plan year. 25A plan’s funding shortfall is the amount by which the plan’s funding target exceeds the net value of plan assets. The shortfall amortization base for a plan year is: (1) the plan’s funding shortfall, minus (2) the present value, determined using the segment interest rates (discussed below), of the aggregate total of the shortfall amortization installments that have been de-termined for the plan year and any suc-ceeding plan year with respect to any short-fall amortization bases for the six previous plan years. The shortfall amortization base is amortized in level annual installments (‘‘shortfall amortization installments’’) over a seven-year period beginning with the cur-rent plan year and using the segment inter-est rates (discussed below). 26 The shortfall amortization base for a plan year may be positive or negative, depending on whether the present value of remaining installments with respect to amortization bases for previous years is more or less than the plan’s funding shortfall. If the shortfall amortization base is positive (that is, the funding shortfall exceeds the present value of the remaining installments), the related shortfall amortization installments are posi-tive. If the shortfall amortization base is negative, the related shortfall amortization installments are negative. The positive and negative shortfall amortization installments for a particular plan year are netted when adding them up in determining the shortfall VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00429 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4588 June 28, 2012 27Any amortization base relating to a funding waiver for a previous year is also eliminated. 28If a plan is in at-risk status, under section 409A(b)(3), limitations apply on the employer’s abil-ity to set aside assets to provide benefits under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 29A similar test applies in order for an employer to be permitted to apply a prefunding balance against its required contribution, that is, for the preceding year, the ratio of the value of plan assets (reduced by any prefunding balance) must be at least 80 per-cent of the plan’s funding target (determined with-out regard to the at-risk rules). 30ERISA sec. 4010. 31Code sec. 436 and ERISA sec. 206(g). 32Code sec. 411(d)(6) and ERISA sec. 204(g). 33Code sec. 417(e) and ERISA sec. 205(g). 34Sec. 415(b). 35Sec. 404. 36Sec. 420.

Single-employer and multiemployer flat-rate premium rates are indexed for inflation. The rate of variable-rate premiums is not indexed. 39ERISA sec. 4010. amortization charge for the plan year, but the resulting shortfall amortization charge cannot be less than zero (i.e., negative amor-tization installments may not offset normal cost). If the net value of plan assets for a plan year is at least equal to the plan’s funding target for the year, so the plan has no fund-ing shortfall, any shortfall amortization bases and related shortfall amortization in-stallments are eliminated. 27As indicated above, if the net value of plan assets exceeds the plan’s funding target, the excess is ap-plied against target normal cost in deter-mining the minimum required contribution. Interest rate used to determine target normal cost and funding target The minimum funding rules for single-em- ployer plans specify the interest rates and other actuarial assumptions that must be used in determining the present value of ben-efits for purposes of a plan’s target normal cost and funding target. Present value is determined using three in- terest rates (‘‘segment’’ rates), each of which applies to benefit payments expected to be made from the plan during a certain period. The first segment rate applies to benefits reasonably determined to be payable during the five-year period beginning on the first day of the plan year; the second segment rate applies to benefits reasonably deter-mined to be payable during the 15-year pe-riod following the initial five-year period; and the third segment rate applies to bene-fits reasonably determined to be payable at the end of the 15-year period. Each segment rate is a single interest rate determined monthly by the Secretary of the Treasury (‘‘Secretary’’) on the basis of a corporate bond yield curve, taking into account only the portion of the yield curve based on cor-porate bonds maturing during the particular segment rate period. The corporate bond yield curve used for this purpose reflects the average, for the 24-month period ending with the preceding month, of yields on investment grade corporate bonds with varying matu-rities and that are in the top three quality levels available. The Internal Revenue Serv-ice (IRS) publishes the segment rates each month. The present value of liabilities under a plan is determined using the segment rates for the ‘‘applicable month’’ for the plan year. The applicable month is the month that in-cludes the plan’s valuation date for the plan year, or, at the election of the employer, any of the four months preceding the month that includes the valuation date. Solely for purposes of determining min- imum required contributions, in lieu of the segment rates described above, an employer may elect to use interest rates on a yield curve based on the yields on investment grade corporate bonds for the month pre-ceding the month in which the plan year be-gins (i.e., without regard to the 24-month averaging described above) (‘‘monthly yield curve’’). If an election to use a monthly yield curve is made, it cannot be revoked without IRS approval. Use of segment rates for other purposes In general In addition to being used to determine a plan’s funding target and target normal cost, the segment rates are used also for other purposes, either directly because the seg-ment rates themselves are specifically cross- referenced or indirectly because funding tar-get, target normal cost, or some other con-cept, such as funding target attainment per-centage (discussed below) in which funding target or target normal cost is an element, is cross-referenced elsewhere. Funding target attainment percentage A plan’s funding target attainment per- centage for a plan year is the ratio, ex-pressed as a percentage, that the net value of plan assets bears to the plan’s funding target for the year. Special rules may apply to a plan if its funding target attainment per-centage is below a certain level. For exam-ple, funding target attainment percentage is used to determine whether a plan is in ‘‘at- risk’’ status, so that special actuarial as-sumptions (‘‘at-risk assumptions’’) must be used in determining the plan’s funding tar-get and target normal cost. 28A plan is in at risk status for a plan year if, for the pre-ceding year: (1) the plan’s funding target at-tainment percentage, determined without re-gard to the at-risk assumptions, was less than 80 percent, and (2) the plan’s funding target attainment percentage, determined using the at-risk assumptions (without re-gard to whether the plan was in at-risk sta-tus for the preceding year), was less than 70 percent. 29In addition, special reporting to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (‘‘PBGC’’) may be required if a plan’s funding target attainment percentage is less than 80 percent. 30 Restrictions on benefit increases, certain types of benefits and benefit accruals (collec-tively referred to as ‘‘benefit restrictions’’) may apply to a plan if the plan’s adjusted funding target attainment percentage is below a certain level. 31Adjusted funding tar- get attainment percentage is determined in the same way as funding target attainment percentage, except that the net value of plan assets and the plan’s funding target are both increased by the aggregate amount of pur-chases of annuities for employees, other than highly compensated employees, made by the plan during the two preceding plan years. Al-though anti-cutback rules generally prohibit reductions in benefits that have already been earned under a plan, 32reductions required to comply with the benefit restrictions are per-mitted. Minimum and maximum lump sums, limits on deductible contributions, retiree health Defined benefit plans commonly allow a participant to choose among various forms of benefit offered under the plan, such as a lump-sum distribution. These optional forms of benefit generally must be actuarially equivalent to the life annuity benefit pay-able to the participant at normal retirement age. For certain forms of benefit, such as lump sums, the benefit amount cannot be less than the amount determined using the segment rates and a specified mortality table. 33For this purpose, however, the seg- ment rates are determined on a monthly basis, rather than using a 24-month average of corporate bond rates. The amount of benefits under a defined benefit plan are subject to certain limits. 34 The segment rates used in determining min-imum lump sums (and certain other forms of benefit) are also used in applying the benefit limits to lump sums (and the certain other forms of benefit). Limits apply to the amount of plan con- tributions that may be deducted by an em-ployer. 35In the case of a single-employer de- fined benefit plan, the plan’s funding target and target normal cost, determined using the segment rates that apply for funding purposes, are taken into account in calcu-lating the limit on deductible contributions. Subject to various conditions, a qualified transfer of excess assets of a single-employer defined benefit plan to a retiree medical ac-count within the plan may be made in order to fund retiree health benefits. 36For this purpose, excess assets generally means the excess, if any, of the value of the plan’s as-sets over 125 percent of the sum of the plan’s funding target and target normal cost for the plan year. PBGC premiums and 4010 reporting PBGC premiums apply with respect to de- fined benefit plans covered by ERISA. 37In the case of a single-employer defined benefit plan, flat-rate premiums apply at a rate of $35.00 per participant for 2012. 38If a single- employer defined benefit plan has unfunded vested benefits, variable-rate premiums also apply at a rate of $9 per $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits divided by the number of par-ticipants. For purposes of determining vari-able-rate premiums, unfunded vested bene-fits are equal to the excess (if any) of (1) the plan’s funding target for the year determined as under the minimum funding rules, but taking into account only vested benefits, over (2) the fair market value of plan assets. In determining the plan’s funding target for this purpose, the interest rates used are seg-ment rates determined as under the min-imum funding rules, but determined on a monthly basis, rather than using a 24–month average of corporate bond rates. In certain circumstances, the contributing sponsor of a single-employer plan defined benefit pension plan covered by the PBGC (and members of the contributing sponsor’s controlled group) must provide certain infor-mation to the PBGC (referred to as ‘‘section 4010 reporting’’). 39This information includes actuarial information with respect to single- employer plans maintained by the contrib-uting sponsor (and controlled group mem-bers). Section 4010 reporting is required if: (1) the funding target attainment percentage at the end of the preceding plan year of a plan maintained by the contributing sponsor or any member of its controlled group is less than 80 percent; (2) the conditions for impo-sition of a lien (i.e., required contributions totaling more than $1 million have not been made) have occurred with respect to a plan maintained by the contributing sponsor or any member of its controlled group; or (3) minimum funding waivers in excess of $1 million have been granted with respect to a plan maintained by the contributing sponsor or any member of its controlled group and any portion of the waived amount is still outstanding.

However, the exception for minimum lump sum ben-efits applies by cross-reference. 43Another provision of the conference agreement extends to December 31, 2021, the ability to make a qualified transfer. In addition, another provision of the conference agreement allows qualified transfers to be made to provide group-term life insurance ben-efits. 44Another provision of the conference agreement increases PBGC flat-rate and variable-rate pre-miums. 45In addition, a reversion may occur only if the terms of the plan so provide. participants or beneficiaries; and (4) the PBGC.40 In addition to the information required to be provided in all funding notices, certain in-formation must be provided in the case of a single-employer defined benefit plan, includ-ing: a statement as to whether the plan’s fund- ing target attainment percentage (as defined under the minimum funding rules) for the plan year to which the notice relates and the two preceding plan years, is at least 100 per-cent (and, if not, the actual percentages); and a statement of (a) the total assets (sepa- rately stating any funding standard carry-over or prefunding balance) and the plan’s li-abilities for the plan year and the two pre-ceding years, determined in the same man-ner as under the funding rules, and (b) the value of the plan’s assets and liabilities as of the last day of the plan year to which the no-tice relates, determined using fair market value and the interest rate used in deter-mining variable rate premiums. A funding notice may also include any ad- ditional information that the plan adminis-trator elects to include to the extent not in-consistent with regulations. The notice must be written so as to be understood by the av-erage plan participant. As required under PPA, the Secretary of Labor has issued a model funding notice that can be used to sat-isfy the notice requirement. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The Senate amendment revises the rules for determining the segment rates under the single-employer plan funding rules by ad-justing a segment rate if the rate determined under the regular rules is outside a specified range of the average of the segment rates for the preceding 25-year period (‘‘average’’ seg-ment rates). In particular, if a segment rate determined for an applicable month under the regular rules is less than the applicable minimum percentage, the segment rate is adjusted upward to match that percentage. If a segment rate determined for an applicable month under the regular rules is more than the applicable maximum percentage, the seg-ment rate is adjusted downward to match that percentage. For this purpose, the aver-age segment rate is the average of the seg-ment rates determined under the regular rules for the 25-year period ending Sep-tember 30 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the plan year begins. The Secretary is to determine average seg-ment rates on an annual basis and may pre-scribe equivalent rates for any years in the 25-year period for which segment rates deter-mined under the regular rules are not avail-able. The Secretary is directed to publish the average segment rates each month. The applicable minimum percentage and the applicable maximum percentage depend on the calendar year in which the plan year begins as shown by the following table: If the calendar year is: The applicable minimum percentage is: The applicable maximum percentage is: 2012 ............................. 90 percent ................... 110 percent 2013 ............................. 85 percent ................... 115 percent 2014 ............................. 80 percent ................... 120 percent 2015 ............................. 75 percent ................... 125 percent 2016 or later ............... 70 percent ................... 130 percent Thus, for example, if the first segment rate determined for an applicable month under the regular rules for a plan year beginning in 2012 is less than 90 percent of the average of the first segment rates determined under the regular rules for the 25-year period ending September 30, 2011, the segment rate is ad-justed to 90 percent of the 25-year average. The change in the method of determining segment rates generally applies for the pur-poses for which segment rates are used under present law, except for purposes of deter-mining minimum and maximum lump-sum benefits, 41limits on deductible contributions to single-employer defined benefit plans, and PBGC variable-rate premiums. Effective date. —The provision in the Senate Amendment is generally effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2011. Under a special rule, an employer may elect, for any plan year beginning on or before the date of enactment and solely for purposes of determining the plan’s adjusted funding tar-get attainment percentage (used in applying the benefit restrictions) for that year, not to have the provision apply. A plan is not treat-ed as failing to meet the requirements of the anti-cutback rules solely by reason of an election under the special rule. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement follows the Sen- ate amendment with several modifications. Average segment rates The change in the method of determining segment rates generally applies for the pur-poses for which segment rates are used under present law, except for purposes of minimum and maximum lump-sum benefits, 42limits on deductible contributions to single-employer defined benefit plans, qualified transfers of excess pension assets to retiree medical ac-counts, 43PBGC variable-rate premiums,44 and 4010 reporting to the PBGC. The special effective date rule is modified under the conference agreement so that an employer may elect, for any plan year begin-ning before January 1, 2013, not to have the provision apply either (1) for all purposes for which the provision would otherwise apply, or (2) solely for purposes of determining the plan’s adjusted funding target attainment percentage (used in applying the benefit re-strictions) for that year. A plan is not treat-ed as failing to meet the requirements of the anti-cutback rules solely by reason of an election under the special rule. Under the conference agreement, if, as of the date of enactment, an employer election is in effect to use a monthly yield curve in determining minimum required contribu-tions, rather than segment rates, the em-ployer may revoke the election (and use seg-ment rates, as modified by the conference agreement provision) without obtaining IRS approval. The revocation must be made at any time before the date that is one year after the date of enactment, and the revoca-tion will be effective for the first plan year to which the amendments made by the provi-sion apply and all subsequent plan years. The employer is not precluded from making a subsequent election to use a monthly yield curve in determining minimum required con-tributions in accordance with present law. Annual funding notice The conference agreement requires addi- tional information to be included in the an-nual funding notice in the case of an applica-ble plan year. For this purpose, an applicable plan year is any plan year beginning after December 31, 2011, and before January 1, 2015, for which (1) the plan’s funding target, deter-mined using segment rates as adjusted to re-flect average segment rates (‘‘adjusted’’ seg-ment rates), is less than 95 percent of the funding target determined without regard to adjusted segment rates (that is, determined as under present law), (2) the plan has a funding shortfall, determined without regard to adjusted segment rates, greater than $500,000 and (3) the plan had 50 or more par-ticipants on any day during the preceding plan year. The additional information that must be provided is: a statement that MAP–21 modified the method for determining the interest rates used to determine the actuarial value of ben-efits earned under the plan, providing for a 25-year average of interest rates to be taken into account in addition to a 2-year average; a statement that, as a result of MAP–21, the plan sponsor may contribute less money to the plan when interest rates are at histor-ical lows, and a table showing, for the applicable plan year and each of the two preceding plan years, the plan’s funding target attainment percentage, funding shortfall, and the em-ployer’s minimum required contribution, each determined both using adjusted seg-ment rates and without regard to adjusted segment rates (that is, as under present law). In the case of a preceding plan year begin-ning before January 1, 2012, the plan’s fund-ing target attainment percentage, funding shortfall, and the employer’s minimum re-quired contribution provided are determined only without regard to adjusted segment rates (that is, as under present law). As under present law, a funding notice may also include any additional information that the plan administrator elects to include to the extent not inconsistent with regulations. For example, a funding notice may include a statement of the amount of the employer’s actual or planned contributions to the plan. The Secretary of Labor is directed to mod- ify the model funding notice required so that the model includes the additional informa-tion in a prominent manner, for example, on a separate first page before the remainder of the notice. C. Transfer of Excess Pension Assets (secs. 40310 and 40311 of the Senate amend- ment, secs. 40241 and 40242 of the con-ference agreement, and sec. 420 of the Code) PRESENT LAW Defined benefit pension plan reversions Defined benefit plan assets generally may not revert to an employer prior to termi-nation of the plan and satisfaction of all plan liabilities. 45Upon plan termination, the ac- crued benefits of all plan participants are re-quired to be 100-percent vested. A reversion prior to plan termination may constitute a prohibited transaction and may result in plan disqualification. Any assets that revert to the employer upon plan termination are includible in the gross income of the em-ployer and subject to an excise tax. The ex-cise tax rate is 20 percent if the employer maintains a replacement plan or makes cer-tain benefit increases in connection with the termination; if not, the excise tax rate is 50 VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00431 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

Medical benefits and life insurance benefits provided under a pension plan Retiree medical accounts A pension plan may provide medical bene- fits to retired employees through a separate account that is part of a defined benefit plan (‘‘retiree medical accounts’’). 46Medical bene- fits provided through a retiree medical ac-count are generally not includible in the re-tired employee’s gross income. 47 Transfers of excess pension assets In general A qualified transfer of excess assets of a defined benefit plan, including a multiem-ployer plan, 48to a retiree medical account within the plan may be made in order to fund retiree health benefits. 49A qualified transfer does not result in plan disqualifica-tion, is not a prohibited transaction, and is not treated as a reversion. Thus, transferred assets are not includible in the gross income of the employer and are not subject to the excise tax on reversions. No more than one qualified transfer may be made in any tax-able year. No qualified transfer may be made after December 31, 2013. Excess assets generally means the excess, if any, of the value of the plan’s assets 50over 125 percent of the sum of the plan’s funding target and target normal cost for the plan year. In addition, excess assets transferred in a qualified transfer may not exceed the amount reasonably estimated to be the amount that the employer will pay out of such account during the taxable year of the transfer for qualified current retiree health liabilities. No deduction is allowed to the employer for (1) a qualified transfer, or (2) the payment of qualified current retiree health liabilities out of transferred funds (and any income thereon). In addition, no de-duction is allowed for amounts paid other than from transferred funds for qualified cur-rent retiree health liabilities to the extent such amounts are not greater than the ex-cess of (1) the amount transferred (and any income thereon), over (2) qualified current retiree health liabilities paid out of trans-ferred assets (and any income thereon). An employer may not contribute any amount to a health benefits account or welfare benefit fund with respect to qualified current retiree health liabilities for which transferred assets are required to be used. Transferred assets (and any income there- on) must be used to pay qualified current re-tiree health liabilities for the taxable year of the transfer. Transferred amounts generally must benefit pension plan participants, other than key employees, who are entitled upon retirement to receive retiree medical bene-fits through the separate account. Retiree health benefits of key employees may not be paid out of transferred assets. Amounts not used to pay qualified current retiree health liabilities for the taxable year of the transfer are to be returned to the gen-eral assets of the plan. These amounts are not includible in the gross income of the em-ployer, but are treated as an employer rever-sion and are subject to a 20-percent excise tax. In order for the transfer to be qualified, ac- crued retirement benefits under the pension plan generally must be 100-percent vested as if the plan terminated immediately before the transfer (or in the case of a participant who separated in the one-year period ending on the date of the transfer, immediately be-fore the separation). In order for a transfer to be qualified, there is maintenance of effort requirement under which, the employer generally must main-tain retiree health benefits at the same level for the taxable year of the transfer and the following four years. In addition, the Employee Retirement In- come Security Act of 1974 (‘‘ERISA’’) 51pro- vides that, at least 60 days before the date of a qualified transfer, the employer must no-tify the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the Treasury, employee representatives, and the plan administrator of the transfer, and the plan administrator must notify each plan participant and beneficiary of the trans-fer. 52 Qualified future transfers and collectively bargained transfers If certain requirements are satisfied, trans- fers of excess pension assets under a single- employer plan to retiree medical accounts to fund the expected cost of retiree medical benefits are permitted for the current and fu-ture years (a ‘‘qualified future transfer’’) and such transfers are also allowed in the case of benefits provided under a collective bar-gaining agreement (a ‘‘collectively bargained transfer’’). 53Transfers must be made for at least a two-year period. An employer can elect to make a qualified future transfer or a collectively bargained transfer rather than a qualified transfer. A qualified future transfer or collectively bargained transfer must meet the requirements applicable to qualified transfers, except that the provision modifies the rules relating to: (1) the determination of excess pension assets; (2) the limitation on the amount transferred; and (3) the mainte-nance of effort requirement. The general sunset applicable to qualified transfer ap-plies (i.e., no transfers can be made after De-cember 31, 2013). Qualified future transfers and collectively bargained transfers can be made to the ex-tent that plan assets exceed 120 percent of the sum of the plan’s funding target and the normal cost for the plan year. During the transfer period, the plan’s funded status must be maintained at the minimum level required to make transfers. If the minimum level is not maintained, the employer must make contributions to the plan to meet the minimum level or an amount required to meet the minimum level must be transferred from the health benefits account. The trans-fer period is the period not to exceed a total of ten consecutive taxable years beginning with the taxable year of the transfer. As pre-viously discussed, the period must be not less than two consecutive years. Employer provided group-term life insurance Group-term life insurance coverage pro- vided under a policy carried by an employer is includible in the gross income of an em-ployee (including a former employee) but only to the extent that the cost exceeds the sum of the cost of $50,000 of such insurance plus the amount, if any, paid by the em-ployee toward the purchase of such insur-ance. 54Special rules apply for determining the cost of group-term life insurance that is includible in gross income under a discrimi- natory group-term life insurance plan. A pension plan may provide life insurance benefits for employees (including retirees) but only to the extent that the benefits are incidental to the retirement benefits pro-vided under the plan. 55The cost of term life insurance provided through a pension plan is includible in the employee’s gross income. 56 HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT Extension of existing provisions The provision allows qualified transfers, qualified future transfers, and collectively bargained transfers to retiree medical ac-counts to be made through December 31, 2021. No transfers are permitted after that date. Transfers to fund retiree group-term life insur- ance permitted The provision allows qualified transfers, qualified future transfers, and collectively bargained transfers to be made to fund the purchase of retiree group-term life insur-ance. The assets transferred for the purchase of group-term life insurance must be main-tained in a separate account within the plan (‘‘retiree life insurance account’’), which must be separate both from the assets in the retiree medical account and from the other assets in the defined benefit plan. Under the provision, the general rule that the cost of group-term life insurance cov-erage provided under a defined benefit plan is includable in gross income of the partici-pant does not apply to group-term life insur-ance provided through a retiree life insur-ance account. Instead, the general rule for determining the amount of employer-pro-vided group-term life insurance that is in-cludible in gross income applies. However, group-term life insurance coverage is per-mitted to be provided through a retiree life insurance account only to the extent that it is not includible in gross income. Thus, gen-erally, only group-term life insurance not in excess of $50,000 may be purchased with such transferred assets. Generally, the present law rules for trans- fers of excess pension assets to retiree med- ical accounts to fund retiree health benefits also apply to transfers to retiree life insur-ance accounts to fund retiree group-term life. However, generally, the rules are ap-plied separately. Thus, for example, the one- transfer-a-year rule generally applies sepa-rately to transfers to retiree life insurance accounts and transfers to retiree medical ac-counts. Further, the maintenance of effort requirement for qualified transfers applies separately to life insurance benefits and health benefits. Similarly, for qualified fu-ture transfers and collectively bargained transfers for retiree group-term life insur-ance, the maintenance of effort and other special rules are applied separately to trans-fers to retiree life insurance accounts and re-tiree medical accounts. Reflecting the inherent differences be- tween life insurance coverage and health coverage, certain rules are not applied to transfers to retiree life insurance accounts, such as the special rules allowing the em-ployer to elect to determine the applicable employer cost for health coverage during the cost maintenance period separately for retir-ees eligible for Medicare and retirees not eli-gible for Medicare. However, a separate test is allowed for the cost of retiree group-term life insurance for retirees under age 65 and those retirees who have reached age 65. The provision makes other technical and conforming changes to the rules for transfers VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00432 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

Effective date. —The provision applies to transfers made after the date of enactment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement includes the Senate amendment provision. D. Exception from Early Distribution Tax for Annuities Under Phased Retirement Program (sec. 100111 of conference agreement and sec. 72(t) of the Code) PRESENT LAW The Code imposes an early distribution tax on distributions made from qualified retire-ment plans before an employee attains age 59 1⁄2.57The tax is equal to 10 percent of the amount of the distribution that is includible in gross income. The 10–percent tax is in ad-dition to the taxes that would otherwise be due on distribution. Certain exceptions to the early distribution tax apply including an exception for distributions after separation from service with the employer after attain-ing age 55, or in the form of substantially equal periodic payments from the qualified retirement plan commencing after separa-tion from service at any age. However, there is no exception for annuity payments that commence before separating from service with the employer. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT No provision. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The Senate amendment and the Conference agreement include a new Federal Phased Re-tirement Program under which a Federal agency may allow a full-time retirement eli-gible employee to elect to enter phased re-tirement status in accordance with regula-tions issued by the Office of Personnel Man-agement (OPM). 58During that status, gen- erally, the employee’s work schedule is a percentage of a full time work schedule, and the employee receives a phased retirement annuity. At full-time retirement, the phased retiree is entitled to a composite retirement annuity that also includes the portion of the employee’s retirement annuity attributable to the reduced work schedule. The Con-ference agreement includes an exception to the early distribution tax for payments under a phased retirement annuity and a composite retirement annuity received by an employee participating in this new Federal Phased Retirement Program. Effective date. —The provision is effective on the effective date of implementing regula-tions issued by OPM implementing the Fed-eral Phased Retirement Program. E.

Expand the Definition of a Tobacco Manufacturer to Include Businesses Making Available Roll-Your-Own Cigarette Machines for Consumer Use (sec. 100116 of the Senate amendment, sec- tion 100112 of the conference agreement, and sec. 5702(d) of the Code) PRESENT LAW Tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes manufactured in the United States or imported into the United States are subject to Federal excise tax at the following rates: 59 Cigars weighing not more than three pounds per thousand (‘‘small cigars’’) are taxed at the rate of $50.33 per thousand; Cigars weighing more than three pounds per thousand (‘‘large cigars’’) are taxed at the rate equal to 52.75 percent of the manu-facturer’s or importer’s sales price but not more than 40.26 cents per cigar; Cigarettes weighing not more than three pounds per thousand (‘‘small cigarettes’’) are taxed at the rate of $50.33 per thousand ($1.0066 per pack); Cigarettes weighing more than three pounds per thousand (‘‘large cigarettes’’) are taxed at the rate of $105.69 per thousand, ex-cept that, if they measure more than six and one-half inches in length, they are taxed at the rate applicable to small cigarettes, counting each two and three-quarter inches (or fraction thereof) of the length of each as one cigarette; Cigarette papers are taxed at the rate of 15 cents for each 50 papers or fractional part thereof, except that, if they measure more than six and one-half inches in length, they are taxable by counting each two and three-quarter inches (or fraction thereof) of the length of each as one cigarette paper; Cigarette tubes are taxed at the rate of 6.30 cents for each 50 tubes or fractional part thereof, except that, if they measure more than six and one-half inches in length, they are taxable by counting each two and three- quarter inches (or fraction thereof) of the length of each as one cigarette tube; Snuff is taxed at the rate of $1.51 per pound, and proportionately at that rate on all fractional parts of a pound; Chewing tobacco is taxed at the rate of 33 cents per pound, and proportionately at that rate on all fractional parts of a pound; Pipe tobacco is taxed at the rate of $2.8311 per pound, and proportionately at that rate on all fractional parts of a pound; and Roll-your-own tobacco is taxed at the rate of $24.78 per pound, and proportionately at that rate on all fractional parts of a pound. In general, the excise tax on tobacco prod- ucts and cigarette papers and tubes manufac-tured in the United States comes into exist-ence when the products are manufactured and is determined and payable when the to-bacco products or cigarette papers and tubes are removed from the bonded premises of the manufacturer. ‘‘Tobacco products’’ means ci-gars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco), pipe tobacco, and roll your own tobacco. Processed tobacco is regu-lated under the internal revenue laws but no excise tax is imposed. Tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes may be exported from the United States without payment of tax. Manufacturers and importers of tobacco products or processed tobacco are subject to certain permitting, bonding, reporting, and record keeping requirements. ‘‘Manufacturer of tobacco products’’ means any person who manufactures cigars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, or roll-your-own to-bacco. There is an exception for a person who produces these products for their own per-sonal consumption or use. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The provision amends the definition of manufacturer of tobacco products to include any person who for commercial purposes makes available machines capable of making tobacco products for consumer use. This in-cludes making a machine available for con-sumers to produce tobacco products for per-sonal consumption or use. The addition of this provision is not intended to change the treatment of such machines under present law, or to make taxable the sale, at retail, for a consumer’s personal home use, a ma-chine designed to produce tobacco only in personal use quantities, where the machine is not used on the retail premises. For purposes of imposing the tax liability, the person making the machine available for consumer use is deemed to be the person making the removal with respect to any to-bacco products manufactured by the ma-chine. Effective date.— The provision is effective for articles removed after the date of enact-ment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement includes the Senate amendment with the following modi-fication. The provision is modified to clarify that a person who sells a machine directly to a consumer at retail for the consumer’s per-sonal home use is not a manufacturer of to-bacco products under the provision if the machine is not used at a retail establishment and is designed to produce only personal use quantities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4592 June 28, 2012 61See Rev. Proc. 72–18, 1972–1 C.B. 740. 62Sec. 265(b)(1). A ‘‘financial institution’’ is any person that (1) accepts deposits from the public in the ordinary course of such person’s trade or busi-ness and is subject to Federal or State supervision as a financial institution or (2) is a corporation de-scribed by section 585(a)(2). Sec. 265(b)(5). 63Sec. 265(b)(3). 64Secs. 265(b)(3)(A), 291(a)(3) and 291(e)(1). 65Sec. 265(b)(3)(C). 66Sec. 265(b)(3)(E). 67Sec. 265(b)(3)(F). 68Sec. 57(a)(5). 69Sec. 56(g)(4)(B). interest deduction is disallowed only if the taxpayer has a purpose of using borrowed funds to purchase or carry tax-exempt obli-gations; a determination of the taxpayer’s purpose in borrowing funds is made based on all of the facts and circumstances. 61 Financial institutions In the case of a financial institution, the Code generally disallows that portion of the taxpayer’s interest expense that is allocable to tax-exempt interest. 62The amount of in- terest that is disallowed is an amount which bears the same ratio to such interest expense as the taxpayer’s average adjusted bases of tax-exempt obligations acquired after Au-gust 7, 1986, bears to the average adjusted bases for all assets of the taxpayer. Exception for certain obligations of qualified small issuers The general rule in section 265(b), denying financial institutions’ interest expense de-ductions allocable to tax-exempt obligations, does not apply to ‘‘qualified tax-exempt obli-gations.’’ 63Instead, as discussed in the next section, only 20 percent of the interest ex-pense allocable to ‘‘qualified tax-exempt ob-ligations’’ is disallowed. 64A ‘‘qualified tax- exempt obligation’’ is a tax-exempt obliga-tion that is (1) issued after August 7, 1986, by a qualified small issuer, (2) not a private ac-tivity bond, and (3) designated by the issuer as qualifying for the exception from the gen-eral rule of section 265(b). A ‘‘qualified small issuer’’ is an issuer that reasonably anticipates that the amount of tax-exempt obligations that it will issue dur-ing the calendar year will be $10 million or less. 65The Code specifies the circumstances under which an issuer and all subordinate entities are aggregated. 66For purposes of the $10 million limitation, an issuer and all enti-ties that issue obligations on behalf of such issuer are treated as one issuer. All obliga-tions issued by a subordinate entity are treated as being issued by the entity to which it is subordinate. An entity formed (or availed of) to avoid the $10 million limita-tion and all entities benefiting from the de-vice are treated as one issuer. Composite issues (i.e., combined issues of bonds for different entities) qualify for the ‘‘qualified tax-exempt obligation’’ exception only if the requirements of the exception are met with respect to (1) the composite issue as a whole (determined by treating the com-posite issue as a single issue) and (2) each separate lot of obligations that is part of the issue (determined by treating each separate lot of obligations as a separate issue). 67Thus a composite issue may qualify for the excep-tion only if the composite issue itself does not exceed $10 million, and if each issuer benefitting from the composite issue reason-ably anticipates that it will not issue more than $10 million of tax-exempt obligations during the calendar year, including through the composite arrangement. Special rules providing modifications to quali- fied small issuer exception for certain issues in 2009 and 2010 With respect to tax-exempt obligations issued during 2009 and 2010, the special rules increased from $10 million to $30 million the annual limit for qualified small issuers. In addition, in the case of a ‘‘qualified fi- nancing issue’’ issued in 2009 or 2010, the spe-cial rules applied the $30 million annual vol-ume limitation at the borrower level (rather than at the level of the pooled financing issuer). Thus, for the purpose of applying the requirements of the section 265(b)(3) quali-fied small issuer exception, the portion of the proceeds of a qualified financing issue that are loaned to a ‘‘qualified borrower’’ that participates in the issue were treated as a separate issue with respect to which the qualified borrower is deemed to be the issuer. A ‘‘qualified financing issue’’ was any com- posite, pooled, or other conduit financing issue the proceeds of which were used di-rectly or indirectly to make or finance loans to one or more ultimate borrowers all of whom are qualified borrowers. A ‘‘qualified borrower’’ meant (1) a State or political sub-division of a State or (2) an organization de-scribed in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(a). Thus, for example, a $100 million pooled financing issue that was issued in 2009 would qualify for the section 265(b)(3) exception if the proceeds of such issue were used to make four equal loans of $25 million to four qualified borrowers. How-ever, if (1) more than $30 million were loaned to any qualified borrower, (2) any borrower were not a qualified borrower, or (3) any bor-rower would, if it were the issuer of a sepa-rate issue in an amount equal to the amount loaned to such borrower, fail to meet any of the other requirements of section 265(b)(3), the entire $100 million pooled financing issue failed to qualify for the exception. For purposes of determining whether an issuer meets the requirements of the small issuer exception, under the special rules, qualified 501(c)(3) bonds issued in 2009 or 2010 were treated as if they were issued by the 501(c)(3) organization for whose benefit they were issued (and not by the actual issuer of such bonds). In addition, in the case of an or-ganization described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a), requirements for ‘‘qualified financing issues’’ were applied as if the section 501(c)(3) organi-zation were the issuer. Thus, in any event, an organization described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) was limited to the $30 million per issuer cap for qualified tax exempt obliga-tions described in section 265(b)(3). HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The provision extends the special rules providing modifications to the qualified small issuer exception to bonds issued after June 30, 2012 and before July 1, 2013. Effective date. —The provision is effective for obligations issued after June 30, 2012. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. B. Temporary Modification of Alternative Minimum Tax Limitations on Tax-Exempt Bonds (sec. 40202 of the Senate amendment and secs. 56 and 57 of the Code) PRESENT LAW Present law imposes an alternative min- imum tax (‘‘AMT’’) on individuals and cor-porations. AMT is the amount by which the tentative minimum tax exceeds the regular income tax. The tentative minimum tax is computed based upon a taxpayer’s alter-native minimum taxable income (‘‘AMTI’’). AMTI is the taxpayer’s taxable income modi-fied to take into account certain preferences and adjustments. One of the preference items is tax-exempt interest on certain tax-exempt bonds issued for private activities. 68Also, in the case of a corporation, an adjustment based on current earnings is determined, in part, by taking into account 75 percent of certain items, including tax-exempt interest, excluded from taxable income but included in the corporation’s earnings and profits. 69 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (‘‘2009 Act’’) provided that tax-ex-empt interest on private activity bonds issued in 2009 and 2010 is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the AMTI and in-terest on tax exempt bonds issued in 2009 and 2010 is not included in the corporate adjust-ment based on current earnings. For these purposes, a refunding bond gen- erally is treated as issued on the date of the issuance of the refunded bond (or in the case of a series of refundings, the original bond). However, the 2009 Act provided that tax-ex-empt interest on bonds issued in 2009 and 2010 to currently refund a bond issued after De-cember 31, 2003, and before January 1, 2009, is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the AMT and is not included in the corporate adjustment based on current earnings. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The provision provides that tax-exempt in- terest on private activity bonds issued after the date of enactment and before January 1, 2013, is not an item of tax preference for pur-poses of the AMT and interest on tax exempt bonds issued during this period is not in-cluded in the corporate adjustment based on current earnings. For these purposes, a re-funding bond is treated as issued on the date of the issuance of the refunded bond (or in the case of a series of refundings, the origi-nal bond). Effective date. —The provision applies to in- terest on bonds issued after the date of en-actment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. C. Issuance of TRIP Bonds by State Infra- structure Banks (sec. 40203 of the Senate amendment) PRESENT LAW There are no Code provisions for the issuance of transportation and regional in-frastructure project (‘‘TRIP’’) bonds. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The provision amends Title 23 to provide that a State, through a State infrastructure bank, may issue TRIP bonds and deposit the proceeds from such bonds into a TRIP bond account of the bank. A ‘‘TRIP bond’’ means any bond issued as part of an issue if (1) 100 percent of the available project proceeds of such issue are to be used for expenditures in-curred after the date of enactment for one or more qualified projects pursuant to an allo-cation of such proceeds to such project or projects by a State infrastructure bank, (2) the bond is issued by a State infrastructure bank and is in registered form (within the meaning of section 149 of the Internal Rev-enue Code), (3) the State infrastructure bank designates such bond for purposes of the pro-vision and (4) the term of each bond that is part of such issue does not exceed 30 years. A ‘‘qualified project’’ means the capital im-provements to any transportation infra-structure project of any governmental unit or other person, including roads, bridges, rail and transit systems, ports and, inland water-ways proposed and approved by a State infra-structure bank, but does not include costs of VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00434 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4593 June 28, 2012 70Secs. 132(f), 3121(b)(2), and 3306(b)(16) and 3401(a)(19). 71Pub. L. No. 111–5. 72Pub. L. No. 111–312. 73Sec. 141(e). 74Sec. 142(a). 75Sec. 4064. 76Sec. 4064(b)(1)(A). 77‘‘Passport Act of 1926,’’ 22 U.S.C. sec. 211a, et seq. operations or maintenance with respect to such project. The provision requires a State to develop a transparent and competitive process for the award of funds deposited into the TRIP bond account that considers the impact of quali-fied projects on the economy, the environ-ment, state of good repair, and equity. The requirements of any Federal law, including Title 23 and Titles 40 and 49, which would otherwise apply to projects to which the United States is a party or to funds made available under such law and projects as-sisted with those funds shall apply to (1) funds made available under the TRIP bond account for similar qualified projects and (2) similar qualified projects assisted through the use of such funds. Effective date. —The provision is effective on the date of enactment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. D. Mass Transit and Parking Benefits (sec. 40204 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 132(f) of the Code) PRESENT LAW Qualified transportation fringe benefits provided by an employer are excluded from an employee’s gross income for income tax purposes and from an employee’s wages for payroll tax purposes. 70Qualified transpor- tation fringe benefits include parking, tran-sit passes, vanpool benefits, and qualified bi-cycle commuting reimbursements. No amount is includible in the income of an em-ployee merely because the employer offers the employee a choice between cash and qualified transportation fringe benefits (other than a qualified bicycle commuting reimbursement). Qualified transportation fringe benefits also include a cash reimburse-ment by an employer to an employee. In the case of transit passes, however, a cash reim-bursement is considered a qualified transpor-tation fringe benefit only if a voucher or similar item which may be exchanged only for a transit pass is not readily available for direct distribution by the employer to the employee. Prior to February 17, 2009, the amount that could be excluded as qualified transportation fringe benefits was limited to $100 per month in combined vanpooling and transit pass ben-efits and $175 per month in qualified parking benefits. All limits are adjusted annually for inflation, using 1998 as the base year (for 2012 the limits are $125 and $240, respectively). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 71provided parity in qualified transportation fringe benefits by tempo-rarily increasing the monthly exclusion for employer-provided vanpool and transit pass benefits to the same level as the exclusion for employer-provided parking, effective for months beginning on or after the date of en-actment (February 17, 2009) and before Janu-ary 1, 2011. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 72extended the parity in qualified transportation fringe benefits through De-cember 31, 2011. Effective January 1, 2012, the amount that could be excluded as qualified transportation fringe benefits is limited to $125 per month in combined vanpooling and transit pass ben- efits and $240 per month in qualified parking benefits. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The Senate amendment extends the parity in qualified transportation fringe benefits for the entirety of 2012. In order for the ex- tension to be effective retroactive to Janu-ary 1, 2012, it is intended that expenses in-curred prior to enactment by an employee for employer-provided vanpool and transit benefits may be reimbursed by employers on a tax free basis to the extent they exceed $125 per month and are less than $240 per month, but only to the extent that such amount has not already been excluded from such employee’s taxable compensation. Effective date. —The provision in the Senate amendment is effective for months after De-cember 31, 2011. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. E. Private Activity Volume Cap Exemption for Sewage and Water Facility Bonds (sec. 40205 of the Senate amendment and sec. 146(g) of the Code) In general Subject to certain Code restrictions, inter- est on bonds issued by State and local gov-ernment generally is excluded from gross in-come for Federal income tax purposes. Bonds issued by State and local governments may be classified as either governmental bonds or private activity bonds. Governmental bonds are bonds the proceeds of which are pri-marily used to finance governmental func-tions or which are repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are bonds in which the State or local government serves as a conduit providing financing to non-governmental persons. For this purpose, the term ‘‘nongovernmental person’’ generally includes the Federal Government and all other individuals and entities other than State or local governments. The exclusion from income for interest on State and local bonds does not apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are issued for certain permitted purposes (‘‘qualified private activ-ity bonds’’) and other Code requirements are met. Qualified private activity bonds Interest on private activity bonds is tax- able unless the bonds meet the requirements for qualified private activity bonds. Quali-fied private activity bonds permit States or local governments to act as conduits pro-viding tax-exempt financing for certain pri-vate activities. The definition of qualified private activity bonds includes an exempt fa-cility bond, or qualified mortgage, veterans’ mortgage, small issue, redevelopment, quali-fied 501(c)(3), or student loan bond. 73The def- inition of exempt facility bond includes bonds issued to finance certain transpor-tation facilities (airports, ports, mass com-muting, and high-speed intercity rail facili-ties); qualified residential rental projects; privately owned and/or operated utility fa-cilities (sewage, water, solid waste disposal, and local district heating and cooling facili-ties, certain private electric and gas facili-ties, and hydroelectric dam enhancements); public/private educational facilities; quali-fied green building and sustainable design projects; and qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities. 74 In most cases, the aggregate volume of these tax-exempt private activity bonds is restricted by annual aggregate volume lim-its imposed on bonds issued by issuers within each State. Certain types of private activity bonds are exempted from the annual volume limits. For calendar year 2012, the State volume cap, which is indexed for inflation, equals $95 per resident of the State, or $284,560,000, whichever is greater. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The provision exempts two types of exempt facility bonds from the annual private activ-ity volume limits. The newly-exempted bonds are exempt facility bonds for sewage and water facilities. The provision only applies to bonds issued before January 1, 2018. Effective date .—The provision is effective for bonds issued after the date of enactment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. F. Dedication of Gas Guzzler Tax to the Highway Trust Fund (sec. 40303 of the Sen-ate amendment and sec. 9503 of the Code) PRESENT LAW Under present law, the Code imposes a tax (‘‘the gas guzzler tax’’) on automobiles that are manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways and that are rated at 6,000 pounds unloaded gross vehicle weight or less. 75The tax is imposed on the sale by the manufacturer of each automobile of a model type with a fuel economy of 22.5 miles per gallon or less. The tax range begins at $1,000 and increases to $7,700 for models with a fuel economy less than 12.5 miles per gallon. Emergency vehicles and non-passenger automobiles are exempt from the tax. The tax also does not apply to non-passenger automobiles. The Secretary of Transpor-tation determines which vehicles are ‘‘non- passenger’’ automobiles, thereby exempting these vehicles from the gas guzzler tax based on regulations in effect on the date of enact-ment of the gas guzzler tax. 76Hence, vehicles defined in Title 49 C.F.R. sec. 523.5 (relating to light trucks) are exempt. These vehicles include those designed to transport property on an open bed (e.g., pick-up trucks) or pro-vide greater cargo-carrying than passenger carrying volume including the expanded cargo-carrying space created through the re-moval of readily detachable seats (e.g., pick- up trucks, vans, and most minivans, sports utility vehicles, and station wagons). Addi-tional vehicles that meet the ‘‘non-pas-senger’’ requirements are those with at least four of the following characteristics: (1) an angle of approach of not less than 28 degrees; (2) a breakover angle of not less than 14 de-grees; (3) a departure angle of not less than 20 degrees; (4) a running clearance of not less than 20 centimeters; and (5) front and rear axle clearances of not less than 18 centi-meters each. These vehicles would include many sports utility vehicles. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The provision requires that amounts equiv- alent to the gas guzzler taxes received in the Treasury be transferred to the Highway Trust Fund. Effective date.— The provision is effective on the date of enactment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. G. Revocation or Denial of Passport in Case of Certain Unpaid Taxes (sec. 40304 of the Senate amendment and new secs. 7345 and 6103(l)(23) of the Code) PRESENT LAW The administration of passports is the re- sponsibility of the Department of State.77 VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00435 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

State may refuse to issue or renew a pass- port if the applicant owes child support in excess of $2,500 or owes certain types of Fed-eral debts, such as expenses incurred in pro-viding assistance to an applicant to return to the United States. The scope of this au-thority does not extend to rejection or rev-ocation of a passport on the basis of delin-quent Federal taxes. Issuance of a passport does not require the applicant to provide a social security number or taxpayer identi-fication number. Returns and return information are con- fidential and may not be disclosed by the IRS, other Federal employees, State employ-ees, and certain others having access to such information except as provided in the Inter-nal Revenue Code. 78There are a number of exceptions to the general rule of nondisclo-sure that authorize disclosure in specifically identified circumstances, including disclo-sure of information about federal tax debts for purposes of reviewing an application for a Federal loan 79and for purposes of enhancing the integrity of the Medicare program.80 HOUSE PROVISION No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT If the Commissioner of Internal Revenue certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury the identity of persons who have seriously delin-quent Federal taxes, the Secretary of Treas-ury or his delegate is authorized to transmit such certification to the Secretary of State for use in determining whether to issue, renew, or revoke a passport. Applicants whose names are included on the certifi-cations provided to the Secretary of State are ineligible for a passport. The provision bars the Secretary of State from issuing a passport to any individual who has a seri-ously delinquent tax debt. It also requires revocation of a passport previously issued to any such individual. Exceptions are per-mitted for emergency or humanitarian cir-cumstances, as well as short term use of a passport for return travel to the United States by the delinquent taxpayer. A seriously delinquent tax debt generally includes any outstanding debt for Federal tax in excess of $50,000, including interest and any penalties, for which a notice of lien or a notice of levy has been filed. This amount is to be adjusted for inflation annu-ally, using calendar year 2011, and a cost-of- living adjustment. Even if a tax debt other-wise meets the statutory threshold, it may not be considered seriously delinquent if (1) the debt is being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an installment agreement or offer-in-compromise, or (2) collection action with respect to the debt is suspended because a collection due process hearing or innocent spouse relief has been requested or is pend-ing. Effective date.— The provision is effective on January 1, 2013. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. H. 100 Percent Continuous Levy on Pay- ments to Medicare Providers and Suppliers (sec. 40305 of the Senate amendment and sec. 6331(h) of the Code) PRESENT LAW In general Levy is the administrative authority of the IRS to seize a taxpayer’s property, or rights to property, to pay the taxpayer’s tax liabil-ity. 81Generally, the IRS is entitled to seize a taxpayer’s property by levy if a Federal tax lien has attached to such property,82the property is not exempt from levy,83and the IRS has provided both notice of intention to levy 84and notice of the right to an adminis- trative hearing (the notice is referred to as a ‘‘collections due process notice’’ or ‘‘CDP no-tice’’ and the hearing is referred to as the ‘‘CDP hearing’’) 85at least 30 days before the levy is made. A levy on salary or wages gen-erally is continuously in effect until re-leased. 86A Federal tax lien arises automati- cally when: (1) a tax assessment has been made; (2) the taxpayer has been given notice of the assessment stating the amount and demanding payment; and (3) the taxpayer has failed to pay the amount assessed within 10 days after the notice and demand. 87 The notice of intent to levy is not required if the Secretary finds that collection would be jeopardized by delay. The standard for de-termining whether jeopardy exists is similar to the standard applicable when determining whether assessment of tax without following the normal deficiency procedures is per-mitted. 88 The CDP notice (and pre-levy CDP hearing) is not required if: (1) the Secretary finds that collection would be jeopardized by delay; (2) the Secretary has served a levy on a State to collect a Federal tax liability from a State tax refund; (3) the taxpayer subject to the levy requested a CDP hearing with respect to unpaid employment taxes arising in the two- year period before the beginning of the tax-able period with respect to which the em-ployment tax levy is served; or (4) the Sec-retary has served a Federal contractor levy. In each of these four cases, however, the tax-payer is provided an opportunity for a hear-ing within a reasonable period of time after the levy. 89 Federal payment levy program To help the IRS collect taxes more effec- tively, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 199790au- thorized the establishment of the Federal Payment Levy Program (‘‘FPLP’’), which al-lows the IRS to continuously levy up to 15 percent of certain ‘‘specified payments’’ by the Federal government if the payees are de-linquent on their tax obligations. With re-spect to payments to vendors of goods, serv-ices, or property sold or leased to the Fed-eral government, the continuous levy may be up to 100 percent of each payment. 91The levy (either up to 15 percent or up to 100 percent) generally continues in effect until the liabil-ity is paid or the IRS releases the levy. Under FPLP, the IRS matches its accounts receivable records with Federal payment records maintained by the Department of the Treasury’s Financial Management Service (‘‘FMS’’), such as certain Social Security benefit and Federal wage records. When these records match, the delinquent tax-payer is provided both the notice of inten-tion to levy and the CDP notice. If the tax-payer does not respond after 30 days, the IRS can instruct FMS to levy the taxpayer’s Fed-eral payments. Subsequent payments are continuously levied until such time that the tax debt is paid or the IRS releases the levy. Payments to Medicare Providers In 2008, the Government Accountability Of- fice (‘‘GAO’’) found that over 27,000 Medicare providers (i.e., about six percent of all such providers) owed more than $2 billion of tax debt, consisting largely of individual income and payroll taxes. 92In one case, a home health company received over $15 million in Medicare payments but did not pay $7 mil-lion in federal taxes. 93As of 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (‘‘CMS’’) had not incorporated most of its Medicare payments into the continuous levy program, despite the IRS authority to continuously levy up to 15 percent of these payments. Thus, for calendar year 2006, the government lost the chance to possibly collect over $140 million in unpaid Federal taxes. 94The GAO noted that CMS officials promised to incor-porate about 60 percent of all Medicare fee- for-service payments into the levy program by October 2008 and the remaining 40 percent in the next several years. Following the GAO study, Congress di- rected CMS to participate in the FPLP and ensure that all Medicare provider and sup-plier payments are processed through it, in specified graduated percentages, by the end of fiscal year 2011. 95 HOUSE PROVISION No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The provision allows Treasury to levy up to 100 percent of a payment to a Medicare provider to collect unpaid taxes. Effective date.— The provision is effective for payments made after the date of enact-ment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. I. Appropriation to the Highway Trust Fund of Amounts Attributable to Certain Duties on Imported Vehicles (sec. 40306 of the Sen-ate amendment) PRESENT LAW Customs duties are deposited into the gen- eral fund of the Treasury of the United States. This includes customs duties col-lected on imported vehicles classified under Chapter 87 of the Harmonized Tariff Sched-ule of the United States. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The provision would appropriate from the General Fund and deposit into the Highway Trust Fund amounts equivalent to amounts received in the General Fund, for FY 2012 through FY 2016, on articles classified under subheadings 8703.22.00 and 8703.24.00 of Chap-ter 87.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4595 June 28, 2012 96Secs. 355 and 368(a)(1)(D). Section 355 imposes re- quirements for a qualified spin-off, split-off, or split- up. Among other requirements, in order for a trans-action to qualify under section 355, the distributing corporation must either (i) distribute all of the stock and securities of the controlled corporation that it holds, or (ii) distribute at least an amount of stock constituting control under section 368(c) and establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the retention of stock (or stock and securities) was not in pursuance of a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of Fed-eral income tax. Sec. 355(a)(1)(D). Section 355 im-poses other requirements to avoid gain recognition at the corporate level with respect to the spin-off, split-up, or split-off, e.g., secs. 355(d) and (e). 97Sec. 361(a). 98Sec. 361(b). 99The last sentence of sec. 361(b)(3). 100Sec. 357(c) and the last sentence of sec. 361(b)(3). 101Section 351(g)(2) defines nonqualified preferred stock as preferred stock if (i) the holder has a right to require the issuer or a related person to redeem or purchase the stock, which right may be exercised within the 20 year period beginning on the issue date and is not subject to a contingency which, as of the issue date, makes remote the likelihood of redemp-tion or purchase; (ii) the issuer or a related person is required to redeem or purchase the stock (within such 20 year period and not subject to such a contin-gency); (iii) the issuer or a related person has the right to redeem or purchase the stock (which right is exercisable within such 20 year period and not subject to such a contingency) and as of the issue date, it is more likely than not that such right will be exercised, or (iv) the dividend on such stock var-ies in whole or in part (directly or indirectly) with reference to interest rates, commodity prices, or other similar indices. There are exceptions for cer-tain rights that are exercisable only on the death, disability or mental incompetency of the holder, or only upon the separation from service of a service provider who received the right as reasonable com-pensation for services, and for certain situations in-volving publicly traded stock. Nonqualified pre-ferred stock is treated in the same manner as securi-ties under section 351 and thus is not qualified con-sideration that may be received tax free by a con-tributing shareholder. Sections 354(a)(2)(C) and 356(e) treat nonqualified preferred stock as taxable consideration if received in exchange for stock by shareholders of a corporation that itself is a party to a reorganization (except to the extent received in exchange for other nonqualified preferred stock); and section 355 contains a similar rule (sec. 355(a)(3)(D)). 102Sec. 6331(a). Levy specifically refers to the legal process by which the IRS orders a third party to turn over property in its possession that belongs to the delinquent taxpayer named in a notice of levy. 103Ibid. 104Sec. 6334. 105Sec. 6331(d). 106Sec. 6330. The notice and the hearing are re- ferred to collectively as the CDP requirements. 107Secs. 6331(e) and 6343. 108Sec. 6321. 109Secs. 6331(d)(3) and 6861. 110Sec. 6330(f). 1115 U.S.C. sec. 8437(e)(3). transferor or one or more of its shareholders, qualifies as a tax-free reorganization if the transfer is made by one corporation (‘‘dis-tributing’’) to a controlled subsidiary cor-poration (‘‘controlled’’), followed by the dis-tribution of the stock and securities of the controlled subsidiary in a divisive spin-off, split-off, or split-up which meets the require-ments of section 355, including an active business requirement and a requirement that the transaction is not used principally as a device for the distribution of earnings and profits (‘‘divisive D reorganization’’). 96 No gain or loss is recognized to a corpora- tion if the corporation is a party to a reorga-nization and exchanges property, in pursu-ance of the plan of reorganization, solely for stock or securities in another corporation that is a party to the reorganization. 97If property other than stock or securities is re-ceived (‘‘other property’’), the transferor cor-poration recognizes gain (if any) to the ex-tent the other property is not distributed. 98 In addition, in a divisive D reorganization, if there is a transfer to the transferor cor-poration’s creditors of money or other prop-erty received from the controlled corpora-tion in the exchange in connection with the reorganization, the transferor distributing corporation recognizes gain to the extent the sum of the money and the fair market value of the other property exceeds the adjusted bases of the assets transferred (reduced by the amount of liabilities assumed by the transferee under section 357(c)). 99Thus, such a transfer to creditors is aggregated with other assumptions of the transferor corpora-tion’s liabilities by the transferee, and the transferor corporation recognizes gain to the extent this aggregate amount exceeds the adjusted basis of assets transferred. 100 For example, if in a divisive D reorganiza- tion the controlled corporation either (1) di-rectly assumes the debt of the distributing corporation, or (2) borrows and distributes cash to the distributing corporation to pay the distributing corporation’s creditors, such debt assumption or cash distribution is treated as money received by the distrib-uting corporation, and the aggregate amount of such debt assumptions and distributions is taxable to the extent it exceeds the distrib-uting corporation’s basis in the assets trans-ferred to the controlled corporation. How-ever, if the controlled corporation issues its own debt securities and such securities are distributed to the creditors of the distrib-uting corporation, the controlled corpora-tion’s debt securities are not treated as money or other property received by the dis-tributing corporation. Thus, the distributing corporation could use the controlled corpora-tion’s securities to retire the distributing corporation’s own debt, recognize no gain, and be in the same economic position as if its debt had been directly assumed by the controlled corporation or as if it had retired its debt with cash received from the con-trolled corporation. In addition, to the ex-tent that such debt securities of the con- trolled corporation are permitted to be re-tained by the distributing corporation, such securities are not treated as taxable prop-erty. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT Under the Senate amendment, in the case of a divisive D reorganization, no gain or loss is recognized to a corporation if the corpora-tion is a party to a reorganization and ex-changes property, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, solely for stock other than nonqualified preferred stock (as defined in section 351(g)(2)). 101Thus, under the provi- sion, securities and nonqualified preferred stock are treated as ‘‘other property.’’ The transferor corporation’s gain on the exchange is recognized to the extent of the sum of money and the value of other prop-erty, including securities and nonqualified preferred stock, not distributed in pursuance of the plan of reorganization. A distribution to creditors of the transferor corporation is not treated as a distribution for this pur-pose. The value of controlled corporation securi- ties or nonqualified preferred stock trans-ferred to creditors of the distributing cor-poration is treated in the same manner as a direct assumption of distributing corpora-tion’s debt by the controlled corporation, or as a distribution of cash (or other non-qualified property) from the controlled cor-poration that is paid to the distributing cor-poration’s creditors, so that the distributing corporation recognizes gain on the exchange to the extent that the sum of such amounts exceeds the adjusted bases of the assets transferred Effective date.— The provision generally ap- plies to exchanges occurring after the date of enactment. However, the provision does not apply to any exchange in connection with a trans-action which is (1) made pursuant to a writ-ten agreement which was binding on Feb-ruary 6, 2012 and at all times thereafter, (2) described in a ruling request submitted to the IRS on or before such date, or (3) de-scribed on or before such date in a public an-nouncement or in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. K. Internal Revenue Service Levies and Thrift Savings Plan Accounts (sec. 40308 of the Senate amendment) PRESENT LAW In general Levy is the IRS’s administrative authority to seize a taxpayer’s property, or rights to property, to pay the taxpayer’s tax liabil-ity. 102Generally, the IRS is entitled to seize a taxpayer’s property by levy if a Federal tax lien has attached to such property, 103the property is not exempt from levy,104and the IRS has provided both notice of intention to levy 105and notice of the right to an adminis- trative hearing (the notice is referred to as a ‘‘collections due process notice’’ or ‘‘CDP no-tice’’ and the hearing is referred to as the ‘‘CDP hearing’’) 106at least 30 days before the levy is made. A levy on salary or wages is generally continuously in effect until re-leased. 107A Federal tax lien arises automati- cally when: (1) a tax assessment has been made; (2) the taxpayer has been given notice of the assessment stating the amount and demanding payment; and (3) the taxpayer has failed to pay the amount assessed within 10 days after the notice and demand. 108 The notice of intent to levy is not required if the Secretary finds that collection would be jeopardized by delay. The standard for de-termining whether jeopardy exists is similar to the standard applicable when determining whether assessment of tax without following the normal deficiency procedures is per-mitted. 109 The CDP notice (and pre-levy CDP hearing) is not required if: (1) the Secretary finds that collection would be jeopardized by delay; (2) the Secretary has served a levy on a State to collect a Federal tax liability from a State tax refund; (3) the taxpayer subject to the levy requested a CDP hearing with respect to unpaid employment taxes arising in the two- year period before the beginning of the tax-able period with respect to which the em-ployment tax levy is served; or (4) the Sec-retary has served a Federal contractor levy. In each of these four cases, however, the tax-payer is provided an opportunity for a hear-ing within a reasonable period of time after the levy. 110 Thrift Savings Plan Present law includes an anti-alienation rule that provides that the balance of an em-ployee’s Thrift Savings Plan (‘‘TSP’’) Ac-count is subject to taking only for the en-forcement of one’s obligations to provide for child support or alimony payments, restitu-tion orders, certain forfeitures, or certain obligations of the Executive Director. 111The authority for the IRS to levy an employee’s TSP Account to satisfy tax liabilities is not mentioned in the anti-alienation rule; TSP Accounts are not specifically enumerated in the Code provisions identifying property that is exempt from levy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4596 June 28, 2012 112Sec. 168. 113Rev. Proc. 87–56, 1987–42 I.R.B. 4. 114Ibid. The longest MACRS recovery period is 50 years and applies to railroad gradings and tunnel bores. Sec. 168(c). 115Secs. 197(d)(1)(D) and (F). The 15–year amortiza- tion provision does not apply to various types of rights, including any interest in land. Sec. 197(e)(2). 116Sec. 141. 117Sec. 147(e). 118Sec. 7701(e). 119Secs. 3101 and 3111. 120Sec. 1401. 121Sec. 101(a)(1). In the case of certain accelerated death benefits and viatical settlements, special rules treat certain amounts as amounts paid by reason of the death of an insured (that is, generally, exclud-able from income). Sec. 101(g). The rules relating to accelerated death benefits provide that amounts treated as paid by reason of the death of the insured include any amount received under a life insurance contract on the life of an insured who is a termi-nally ill individual, or who is a chronically ill indi-vidual (provided certain requirements are met). For this purpose, a terminally ill individual is one who has been certified by a physician as having an ill-ness or physical condition which can reasonably be expected to result in death in 24 months or less after the date of the certification. A chronically ill indi-vidual is one who has been certified by a licensed health care practitioner within the preceding 12– month period as meeting certain ability-related re-quirements. In the case of a viatical settlement, if any portion of the death benefit under a life insur-ance contract on the life of an insured who is termi-nally ill or chronically ill is sold to a viatical settle-ment provider, the amount paid for the sale or as-signment of that portion is treated as an amount paid under the life insurance contract by reason of the death of the insured (that is, generally, exclud-able from income). For this purpose, a viatical set-tlement provider is a person regularly engaged in the trade or business of purchasing, or taking as-signments of, life insurance contracts on the lives of terminally ill or chronically ill individuals (pro-vided certain requirements are met). 122Sec. 101(a)(2). 123Sec. 101(a)(2)(A). 124Sec. 101(a)(2)(B). 1252009–21 I.R.B. 1029. SENATE AMENDMENT The provision amends the statutory provi- sions governing the TSP to clarify that the anti-alienation provisions therein do not bar the IRS from issuing a notice of levy on a TSP Account. Effective date.— The provision is effective upon date of enactment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. L. Depreciation and Amortization Rules for Highway and Related Property Subject to Long-Term Leases (sec. 40309 of the Senate amendment and secs. 168, 197, and 147 of the Code) PRESENT LAW Depreciation and amortization for highways and related property A taxpayer generally must capitalize the cost of property used in a trade or business and recover such cost over time through an-nual deductions for depreciation or amorti-zation. Tangible property generally is depre-ciated under the modified accelerated cost recovery system (‘‘MACRS’’), which deter-mines depreciation by applying specific re-covery periods, placed-in-service conven-tions, and depreciation methods to the cost of various types of depreciable property. 112 The alternative depreciation system (‘‘ADS’’) applies with respect to tangible property used predominantly outside the United States during the taxable year, tax- exempt use property, tax-exempt bond fi-nanced property, and certain other property. ADS generally requires the use of the straight-line method without regard to sal-vage value, and requires longer recovery pe-riods than MACRS. Under MACRS, the cost of land improve- ments (such as roads and fences) is recovered over 15 years. 113Land improvements subject to ADS are recovered over 20 years using the straight-line method. 114 Amortization of intangible property The cost recovery of many intangible as- sets is governed by the rules of section 197. In particular, section 197 provides that any amortizable section 197 intangible, including rights granted by a governmental unit and franchise rights, is amortized over a 15–year period. 115 Private activity bond financing for highways In general, interest on a private activity bond that is a qualified bond is excludable from taxable income. 116Under present law, a private activity bond is not a qualified bond, interest on which is tax-exempt, if any por-tion of the proceeds of the issue of which the bond is a part is used to provide any air-plane, skybox, or other private luxury box, health club facility, facility primarily used for gambling, or store the principal business of which is the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption off premises. 117 HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT Under this provision, the depreciation for applicable leased highway property is deter-mined under ADS with a statutory 45-year recovery period and requirement to use the straight-line method. Further, this provision requires that any amortizable section 197 in- tangible acquired in connection with an ap-plicable lease must be recovered over a pe-riod not less than the term of the applicable lease. Under this provision, private activity bonds are not qualified bonds, interest on which is tax-exempt, if the bonds are part of an issue, any portion of the proceeds of which is used to finance any applicable leased highway property. For purposes of this provision, applicable leased highway property is defined as prop-erty subject to an applicable lease and placed in service before the date of such lease. An applicable lease is defined as an ar-rangement between the taxpayer and a State or political subdivision thereof, or any agen-cy or instrumentality of either, under which the taxpayer leases a highway and associated improvements, receives a right-of-way on the public lands underlying such highway and improvements, and receives a grant of a franchise or other intangible right permit-ting the taxpayer to receive funds relating to the operation of such highway. As under present law, a contract that purports to be a service contract or other arrangement (in-cluding a partnership or other passthrough entity) is treated as a lease if the contract or arrangement is properly treated as a lease. 118 Effective date.— The provision is effective for leases entered into, and private activity bonds issued, after the date of enactment. CONFERENE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. M. Transfers to Federal Old-Age and Sur- vivors Insurance Trust Fund and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund (sec. 40314 of the Senate amendment) PRESENT LAW To finance Social Security and Medicare benefits, taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (‘‘FICA’’) are imposed on employers and employees with respect to employee wages. 119Similar taxes are im- posed under the Self-Employment Contribu-tions Act (‘‘SECA’’) on self-employed indi-viduals with respect to their self-employ-ment income. 120These taxes consist of two parts: (1) old-age, survivors, and disability insurance (‘‘OASDI’’), which correlates to the Social Security program that provides monthly benefits after retirement, death or disability; and (2) Medicare hospital insur-ance (‘‘HI’’). HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT Under the Senate amendment, the fol- lowing amounts are transferred from the General Fund to the OASDI Trust Funds: $27 million in fiscal year 2012, and $82 million in fiscal year 2014. Effective date. —The Senate amendment provision is effective on the date of enact-ment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. N. Modify Rules that Apply to Sales of Life Insurance Contracts (secs. 100112–4 of the Senate amendment and new sec. 6050X of the Code) PRESENT LAW An exclusion from Federal income tax is provided for amounts received under a life insurance contract paid by reason of the death of the insured. 121 Under rules known as the transfer for value rules, if a life insurance contract is sold or otherwise transferred for valuable consideration, the amount paid by reason of the death of the insured that is excludable generally is limited. 122Under the limitation, the excludable amount may not exceed the sum of (1) the actual value of the consider-ation, and (2) the premiums or other amounts subsequently paid by the transferee of the contract. Thus, for example, if a per-son buys a life insurance contract, and the consideration he pays combined with his sub-sequent premium payments on the contract are less than the amount of the death benefit he later receives under the contract, then the difference is includable in the buyer’s in-come. Exceptions are provided to the limitation on the excludable amount. The limitation on the excludable amount does not apply if (1) the transferee’s basis in the contract is de-termined in whole or in part by reference to the transferor’s basis in the contract, 123or (2) the transfer is to the insured, to a partner of the insured, to a partnership in which the insured is a partner, or to a corporation in which the insured is a shareholder or offi-cer. 124 IRS guidance sets forth more details of the tax treatment of a life insurance policy-holder who sells or surrenders the life insur-ance contract and the tax treatment of other sellers and of buyers of life insurance con-tracts. The guidance relates to the character of taxable amounts (ordinary or capital) and to the taxpayer’s basis in the life insurance contract. In Revenue Ruling 2009–13, 125the IRS ruled that income recognized under section 72(e) on surrender to the life insurance company of a life insurance contract with cash value is ordinary income. In the case of sale of a cash value life insurance contract, the IRS ruled that the insured’s (seller’s) basis is re-duced by the cost of insurance, and the gain on sale of the contract is ordinary income to the extent of the amount that would be rec-ognized as ordinary income if the contract were surrendered (the ‘‘inside buildup’’), and any excess is long-term capital gain. Gain on the sale of a term life insurance contract (without cash surrender value) is long-term capital gain under the ruling.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4597 June 28, 2012 1262009–21 I.R.B. 1031. 12731 U.S.C. sec. 5311. 12831 U.S.C. sec. 5314. The term ‘‘agency’’ in the Bank Secrecy Act includes financial institutions. 12931 U.S.C. sec. 5314(a) provides: ‘‘Considering the need to avoid impeding or controlling the export or import of monetary instruments and the need to avoid burdening unreasonably a person making a transaction with a foreign financial agency, the Sec-retary of the Treasury shall require a resident or citizen of the United States or a person in, and doing business in, the United States, to keep records, file reports, or keep records and file reports, when the resident, citizen, or person makes a transaction or maintains a relation for any person with a foreign financial agency.’’ 130See, e.g., Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 107–56 (October 26, 2001) (sections 351 through 366). 13131 U.S.C. sec. 5318A. In Revenue Ruling 2009–14,126the IRS ruled that under the transfer for value rules, a por-tion of the death benefit received by a buyer of a life insurance contract on the death of the insured is includable as ordinary income. The portion is the excess of the death benefit over the consideration and other amounts (e.g., premiums) paid for the contract. Upon sale of the contract by the purchaser of the contract, the ruling concludes that the gain is long-term capital gain, and in determining the gain, the basis of the contract is not re-duced by the cost of insurance. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT In general The provision imposes reporting require- ments in the case of the purchase of an exist-ing life insurance contract in a reportable policy sale and imposes reporting require-ments on the payor in the case of the pay-ment of reportable death benefits. The provi-sion sets forth rules for determining the basis of a life insurance or annuity contract. Lastly, the provision modifies the transfer for value rules in a transfer of an interest in a life insurance contract that is a reportable policy sale. Reporting requirements for acquisitions of life insurance contracts Reporting upon acquisition of life insurance contract The reporting requirement applies to every person who acquires a life insurance con-tract, or any interest in a life insurance con-tract, in a reportable policy sale during the taxable year. A reportable policy sale means the acquisition of an interest in a life insur-ance contract, directly or indirectly, if the acquirer has no substantial family, business, or financial relationship with the insured (apart from the acquirer’s interest in the life insurance contract). An indirect acquisition includes the acquisition of an interest in a partnership, trust, or other entity that holds an interest in the life insurance contract. Under the reporting requirement, the acquiror of the contract reports information about the acquisition to the IRS, to the in-surance company that issued the contract, and to the person or persons receiving a pay-ment. The information reported by the acquiror about the acquisition of the con-tract is (1) the acquiror’s name, address, and taxpayer identification number (‘‘TIN’’), (2) the name, address, and TIN of each recipient of payment in the reportable policy sale, (3) the date of the reportable policy sale, (4) the name of the issuer and the policy number of the life insurance contract, and (5) the amount of each payment. The statement the acquiror provides to any issuer of a life insurance contract is not required to include the amount of the pay-ment or payments for the acquisition of the contract. The statement the acquiror pro-vides to any issuer of a life insurance con-tract or recipient of a payment in the report-able policy sale also includes the name, ad-dress, and phone number of the acquiror’s in-formation contact. Reporting of seller’s basis in the life insurance contract On receipt of a report described above, or on any notice of the transfer of a life insur-ance contract to a foreign person, each issuer is required to report to the IRS and to the seller or transferor (1) the basis of the contract (i.e., the investment in the contract within the meaning of section 72(e)(6)), (2) the name, address, and TIN of the seller or the transferor to a foreign person, and (3) the policy number of the contract. Notice of the transfer of a life insurance contract to a for-eign person is intended to include any sort of notice, including information provided for nontax purposes such as change of address notices for purposes of sending statements or for other purposes, or information relating to loans, premiums, or death benefits with respect to the contract. The statement the issuer provides to any seller or transferor to a foreign person also includes the name, address, and phone num-ber of the issuer’s information contact. Reporting with respect to reportable death benefits When a reportable death benefit is paid under a life insurance contract, the payor in-surance company is required to report infor-mation about the payment to the IRS and to the payee. Under this reporting requirement, the payor reports (1) the payor’s name, ad-dress, and TIN; (2) the name, address, and TIN of each recipient of payment; (3) the date of each payment; and (4) the amount of each payment. A reportable death benefit means an amount paid by reason of the death of the insured under a life insurance contract that has been transferred in a re-portable policy sale. The statement the payor provides to any payee also includes the name, address, and phone number of the payor’s information contact. Payment For purposes of these reporting require- ments, payment means the amount of cash and the fair market value of any consider-ation transferred in a reportable policy sale. Determination of basis The provision provides that in determining the basis of a life insurance or annuity con-tract, no adjustment is made for mortality, expense, or other reasonable charges in-curred under the contract (known as ‘‘cost of insurance’’). This reverses the position of the IRS in Revenue Ruling 2009–13 that on sale of a cash value life insurance contract, the in-sured’s (seller’s) basis is reduced by the cost of insurance. Scope of transfer for value rules The provision provides that the exceptions to the transfer for value rules do not apply in the case of a transfer of a life insurance contract, or any interest in a life insurance contract, in a reportable policy sale. Thus, some portion of the death benefit ultimately payable under such a contract may be in-cludable in income. Effective date Under the provision, the reporting require- ment is effective for reportable policy sales occurring after December 31, 2012, and re-portable death benefits paid after December 31, 2012. The clarification of the basis rules for life insurance and annuity contracts is effective for transactions entered into after August 25, 2009. The modification of excep-tion to the transfer for value rules is effec-tive for transfers occurring after December 31, 2012. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. O. Authorizing Special Measures against Foreign Jurisdictions, Financial Institu-tions, and Others that Significantly Im-pede U.S. Tax Enforcement (sec. 100201 of the Senate amendment and 31 U.S.C. sec. 5138A) PRESENT LAW Cross-border transfers of assets to, and in- terests held in, foreign bank accounts or for-eign entities are subject to reporting re-quirements under Title 31 (the Bank Secrecy Act) of the United States Code. The Bank Se- crecy Act requires both financial institu-tions and account holders to report informa-tion that has ‘‘a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings.’’ 127Citizens and residents of the United States as well as persons doing busi-ness in the United States are required to keep records and file reports that contain the following information ‘‘in the way and to the extent the Secretary prescribes’’ if they enter into a transaction or maintain an ac-count with a foreign financial agency: (1) the identity and address of participants in a transaction or relationship; (2) the legal ca-pacity in which a participant is acting; (3) the identity of real parties in interest; and (4) a description of the transaction, as speci-fied by the Secretary. 128Regulations promul- gated pursuant to broad regulatory author-ity granted to the Secretary in the Bank Se-crecy Act 129provide additional guidance re- garding the disclosure obligation with re-spect to foreign accounts. As part of a series of reforms directed at international financing of terrorism, 130the Bank Secrecy Act authorizes the Secretary of Treasury to impose special measures on certain domestic institutions or agencies if, after consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, the Sec-retary of Treasury determines that there are reasonable grounds to conclude that a juris-diction or institution operating outside the United States, or accounts or transactions involving such jurisdictions or institutions, are of primary money laundering concern. 131 In determining whether a particular juris- diction is of primary money laundering con-cern, the Secretary considers multiple fac-tors that may evidence that the jurisdiction lacks adequate transparency and may be a haven for criminal activities. Evidence that groups involved in organized crime, inter- national terrorism or proliferation of weap-ons of mass destruction have transacted business in that jurisdiction as well as the degree of corruption among high-level offi-cials must be considered. With respect to as-sessing the fiscal transparency of the juris-diction, factors include the domestic laws of that jurisdiction and their administration; the reputation of the jurisdiction as an off-shore banking haven by credible inter-national organizations; the extent to which the jurisdiction offers regulatory advantages to nonresidents; and whether the United States has a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (‘‘MLAT’’) with the jurisdiction, and if so, experience of U.S. officials in obtaining in-formation under that agreement. In determining whether to apply one or more special measure to a particular institu-tion, or with respect to a type of account or transaction, the Secretary considers whether the transactions, accounts or institutions fa-cilitate money laundering through a par-ticular jurisdiction. The Secretary also looks at evidence that organized criminal groups or terrorists have been able to avail VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00439 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4598 June 28, 2012 132Section 5318A(4)(A) requires consultation with Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-tem, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Na-tional Credit Union Administration Board, any other appropriate Federal banking agency and any other interested party identified by the Secretary. 133Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (‘‘HIRE’’), Pub. L. No. 111–147 (2010). 134Subtitle A of Title V of the HIRE Act, entitled ‘‘Foreign Account Tax Compliance,’’ was based on legislative proposals in the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (‘‘FATCA’’), a bill introduced in both the House and Senate on October 27, 2009. See H.R. 3933 and S. 1934, respectively. 135Under section 1471(c), an FFI must report (1) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each U.S. person or a foreign entity with one or more substantial U.S. owners holding an account, (2) the account number, (3) the account balance or value, and (4) except as provided by the Secretary, the gross receipts and gross withdrawals or pay-ments from the account. 136The information reporting requirement under the HIRE Act generally applies to payments made after December 31, 2012. 137TIEAs are entered into by the Administration, without the advice and consent of the Senate. In contrast to the bilateral tax treaties, TIEAs are gen-erally limited in scope to mutual exchange of infor-mation. Since the 1980s, the United States has en-tered into over 20 such agreements. 138Overview of the OECD’s Work on International Tax Evasion (A note by the OECD Secretariat), p. 3, March 23, 2009. 139However, exceptions to the fungibility principle are provided in particular cases, some of which are described below. 140Temp.

The extent to which legitimate business is conducted through the accounts or institutions is also considered. The selection of the specific measures is made after consultation with other financial regulatory agencies and the Secretary of State. 132The factors that must be considered in selecting which of the measures to invoke are enumerated and include U.S. national se-curity and foreign policy; the cost and bur-den of compliance with the measures; wheth-er U.S. financial institutions will be placed at a competitive disadvantages as a result; the impact of the measure on the inter-national payment, clearance and settlement system; and whether any similar sanction has been imposed by another nation or mul-tilateral group. Increased reporting obliga-tions with respect to types of transactions or accounts involving a foreign jurisdiction, mandatory collection of information about beneficial ownership of certain types of ac-counts, and prohibitions against opening or maintaining payable-through or cor-respondent accounts with a nexus to foreign jurisdictions are among the measures per-mitted. These measures may be imposed sep-arately or in combination. Cross-border payment flows are also sub- ject to reporting obligations for tax pur-poses. 133Those reporting obligations and re- lated provisions are commonly referred to as FATCA, 134which added new Chapter 4, a re- porting and withholding regime, to Subtitle A of the Code. Chapter 4 requires reporting of specific information by third parties for certain U.S. accounts held in foreign finan-cial institutions (‘‘FFIs’’). 135Information re- porting is encouraged through the with-holding of tax on payments to FFIs unless the FFI enters into and complies with an in-formation reporting agreement with the Sec-retary of the Treasury. 136 Access to the foreign-based documents nec- essary to combat money laundering and tax evasion is secured through information ex-changes with foreign jurisdictions under the terms of various treaties and international agreements, such as MLAT, tax treaties, or tax information exchange agreements (‘‘TIEA’’). 137International norms regarding fiscal transparency and exchange of informa-tion for tax administration purposes are re-flected in the standards developed by the Or-ganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (‘‘OECD’’). The OECD Stand-ards have been endorsed by the G–20 Min-isters of Finance. Whether by tax treaty or TIEA, the OECD Standards require that a ju-risdiction (1) exchange information where it is ‘‘foreseeably relevant’’ to the administra-tion and enforcement of the domestic laws of a requesting State; (2) not restrict exchanges on the basis of bank secrecy or domestic tax interest requirements; (3) have powers to en-force access to reliable information; (4) re-spect taxpayer rights; and (5) maintain strict confidentiality of information exchanged. 138 HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The provision expands the special meas- ures powers under the Bank Secrecy Act by authorizing use of the powers based on a finding, made in consultation with the Com-missioner of the IRS, the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, that an institu-tion, jurisdiction or international trans-action is significantly impeding tax enforce-ment. In making such a finding, cooperation of an institution or jurisdiction with the im-plementation of FATCA may be favorably considered. The information and consulta-tions to be considered in making a finding to support use of the special measures on the basis of either money-laundering or tax en-forcement concerns are expanded to require consideration of U.S. experience with admin-istrative assistance requests under a tax treaty or tax information exchange agree-ment. Furthermore, a number of conforming changes are made to the enumeration of con-siderations to ensure that factors relevant to tax enforcement are considered. The process for selection of special meas- ures to be taken and the considerations for their selection remain the same as under present law, except for the identity of the persons or agencies to be consulted in the process when the use of special measures is based on a finding that U.S. tax enforcement is being significantly impeded. In that case, the Secretary of Treasury is required to con-sult only with the Commissioner of IRS, the Secretary of State and the Attorney Gen-eral. The Secretary of Treasury has sole dis-cretion whether to consult any other agen-cies. All special measures under present law are available for both anti-money-laundering and tax enforcement-based findings. The ability to prohibit or impose conditions on the use of correspondent or payable-through accounts is expanded to include the author-ization, approval or use in the United States of a credit card, charge card, debit card or other similar financial instrument. Effective date. —The provision is effective upon date of enactment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. P. Delay in Application of Worldwide Interest (sec. 1801 of the Senate amendment and sec. 864(f) of the Code) PRESENT LAW In general To compute the foreign tax credit limita- tion, a taxpayer must determine the amount of its taxable income from foreign sources. Thus, the taxpayer must allocate and appor-tion deductions between items of U.S.-source gross income, on the one hand, and items of foreign-source gross income, on the other. In the case of interest expense, the rules generally are based on the approach that money is fungible and that interest expense is properly attributable to all business ac- tivities and property of a taxpayer, regard-less of any specific purpose for incurring an obligation on which interest is paid. 139For interest allocation purposes, all members of an affiliated group of corporations generally are treated as a single corporation (the so- called ‘‘one-taxpayer rule’’) and allocation must be made on the basis of assets rather than gross income. The term ‘‘affiliated group’’ in this context generally is defined by reference to the rules for determining whether corporations are eligible to file con-solidated returns. For consolidation purposes, the term ‘‘af- filiated group’’ means one or more chains of includible corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent cor-poration that is an includible corporation, but only if: (1) the common parent owns di-rectly stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total voting power and at least 80 per-cent of the total value of at least one other includible corporation; and (2) stock meeting the same voting power and value standards with respect to each includible corporation (excluding the common parent) is directly owned by one or more other includible cor-porations. Generally, the term ‘‘includible corpora- tion’’ means any domestic corporation ex-cept certain corporations exempt from tax under section 501 (for example, corporations organized and operated exclusively for chari-table or educational purposes), certain life insurance companies, corporations electing application of the possession tax credit, reg-ulated investment companies, real estate in- vestment trusts, and domestic international sales corporations. A foreign corporation generally is not an includible corporation. Subject to exceptions, the consolidated re- turn and interest allocation definitions of af-filiation generally are consistent with each other. For example, both definitions gen-erally exclude all foreign corporations from the affiliated group. Thus, while debt gen-erally is considered fungible among the as-sets of a group of domestic affiliated cor-porations, the same rules do not apply as be-tween the domestic and foreign members of a group with the same degree of common con-trol as the domestic affiliated group. Banks, savings institutions, and other finan- cial affiliates The affiliated group for interest allocation purposes generally excludes what are re-ferred to in the Treasury regulations as ‘‘fi-nancial corporations.’’ 140A financial cor- poration includes any corporation, otherwise a member of the affiliated group for consoli-dation purposes, that is a financial institu-tion (described in section 581 or section 591), the business of which is predominantly with persons other than related persons or their customers, and which is required by State or Federal law to be operated separately from any other entity that is not a financial insti-tution. 141The category of financial corpora- tions also includes, to the extent provided in regulations, bank holding companies (includ-ing financial holding companies), subsidi-aries of banks and bank holding companies (including financial holding companies), and savings institutions predominantly engaged in the active conduct of a banking, financ-ing, or similar business. 142 A financial corporation is not treated as a member of the regular affiliated group for purposes of applying the one-taxpayer rule to other nonfinancial members of that group.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4599 June 28, 2012 143Pub. L. No. 108–357, sec. 401. 144For purposes of determining the assets of the worldwide affiliated group, neither stock in corpora-tions within the group nor indebtedness (including receivables) between members of the group is taken into account. 145Although the interest expense of a foreign sub- sidiary is taken into account for purposes of allo-cating the interest expense of the domestic members of the electing worldwide affiliated group for foreign tax credit limitation purposes, the interest expense incurred by a foreign subsidiary is not deductible on a U.S. return. 146Indirect ownership is determined under the rules of section 958(a)(2) or through applying rules similar to those of section 958(a)(2) to stock owned directly or indirectly by domestic partnerships, trusts, or estates. 147See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.904–4(e)(2). 148As originally enacted under AJCA, the world- wide interest allocation rules were effective for tax-able years beginning after December 31, 2008. How-ever, section 3093 of the Housing and Economic Re-covery Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110–289, delayed the implementation of the worldwide interest allocation rules for two years, until taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010; section 15 of the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111–92, delayed the implementation of the worldwide interest allocation rules for seven years, until taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017; and section 551 of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, Pub. L. No. 111–126, fur-ther delayed implementation of the worldwide inter-est allocation rules for three years, until taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020. Instead, all such financial corporations that would be so affiliated are treated as a sepa-rate single corporation for interest alloca-tion purposes. Worldwide interest allocation In general The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (‘‘AJCA’’) 143modified the interest expense allocation rules described above (which gen-erally apply for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit limitation) by providing a one-time election (the ‘‘worldwide affiliated group election’’) under which the taxable in-come of the domestic members of an affili-ated group from sources outside the United States generally is determined by allocating and apportioning interest expense of the do-mestic members of a worldwide affiliated group on a worldwide-group basis (i.e., as if all members of the worldwide group were a single corporation). If a group makes this election, the taxable income of the domestic members of a worldwide affiliated group from sources outside the United States is de-termined by allocating and apportioning the third-party interest expense of those domes-tic members to foreign-source income in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (1) the worldwide affiliated group’s worldwide third- party interest expense multiplied by the ratio that the foreign assets of the worldwide affiliated group bears to the total assets of the worldwide affiliated group, 144over (2) the third-party interest expense incurred by for-eign members of the group to the extent such interest would be allocated to foreign sources if the principles of worldwide inter-est allocation were applied separately to the foreign members of the group. 145 For purposes of the new elective rules based on worldwide fungibility, the world-wide affiliated group means all corporations in an affiliated group as well as all con-trolled foreign corporations that, in the ag-gregate, either directly or indirectly, 146 would be members of such an affiliated group if section 1504(b)(3) did not apply (i.e., in which at least 80 percent of the vote and value of the stock of such corporations is owned by one or more other corporations in-cluded in the affiliated group). Thus, if an af-filiated group makes this election, the tax-able income from sources outside the United States of domestic group members generally is determined by allocating and apportioning interest expense of the domestic members of the worldwide affiliated group as if all of the interest expense and assets of 80-percent or greater owned domestic corporations (i.e., corporations that are part of the affiliated group, as modified to include insurance com-panies) and certain controlled foreign cor-porations were attributable to a single cor-poration. Financial institution group election Taxpayers are allowed to apply the bank group rules to exclude certain financial in-stitutions from the affiliated group for inter-est allocation purposes under the worldwide fungibility approach. The rules also provide a one-time ‘‘financial institution group’’ election that expands the bank group. At the election of the common parent of the pre- election worldwide affiliated group, the in-terest expense allocation rules are applied separately to a subgroup of the worldwide af-filiated group that consists of (1) all corpora-tions that are part of the bank group, and (2) all ‘‘financial corporations.’’ For this pur-pose, a corporation is a financial corporation if at least 80 percent of its gross income is fi-nancial services income (as described in sec-tion 904(d)(2)(D)(ii) and the regulations thereunder) that is derived from trans-actions with unrelated persons. 147For these purposes, items of income or gain from a transaction or series of transactions are dis-regarded if a principal purpose for the trans-action or transactions is to qualify any cor-poration as a financial corporation. In addition, anti-abuse rules are provided under which certain transfers from one mem-ber of a financial institution group to a member of the worldwide affiliated group outside of the financial institution group are treated as reducing the amount of indebted-ness of the separate financial institution group. Regulatory authority is provided with respect to the election to provide for the di-rect allocation of interest expense in cir-cumstances in which such allocation is ap-propriate to carry out the purposes of these rules, to prevent assets or interest expense from being taken into account more than once, or to address changes in members of any group (through acquisitions or other-wise) treated as affiliated under these rules. Effective date of worldwide interest allocation The common parent of the domestic affili- ated group must make the worldwide affili-ated group election. It must be made for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2020, in which a worldwide affiliated group exists that includes at least one for-eign corporation that meets the require-ments for inclusion in a worldwide affiliated group. 148The common parent of the pre-elec- tion worldwide affiliated group must make the election for the first taxable year begin-ning after December 31, 2020, in which a worldwide affiliated group includes a finan-cial corporation. Once either election is made, it applies to the common parent and all other members of the worldwide affiliated group or to all members of the financial in-stitution group, as applicable, for the tax-able year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years, unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The provision delays the effective date of the worldwide interest allocation rules for one year, until taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021. The required dates for making the worldwide affiliated group elec-tion and the financial institution group elec- tion are changed accordingly. Effective date. —The provision is effective on the date of enactment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. PART IV—TAX COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS Section 4022(b) of the Internal Revenue Service Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (the ‘‘IRS Reform Act’’) requires the Joint Committee on Taxation (in consulta-tion with the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of the Treasury) to provide a tax complexity analysis. The complexity analysis is required for all legislation re-ported by the Senate Committee on Finance, the House Committee on Ways and Means, or any committee of conference if the legisla-tion includes a provision that directly or in-directly amends the Internal Revenue Code (the ‘‘Code’’) and has widespread applica-bility to individuals or small businesses. The staff of the Joint Committee on Tax- ation has determined that a complexity analysis is not required under section 4022(b) of the IRS Reform Act because the bill con-tains no provisions that have ‘‘widespread applicability’’ to individuals or small busi-nesses. A. PBGC Premiums (secs. 40221–40222 of the conference agreement and ERISA sec. 4006) PRESENT LAW Defined benefit plans subject to ERISA are covered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (‘‘PBGC’’) insurance program and related premium requirements. In the case of a single-employer defined benefit plan, flat-rate premiums apply at a rate of $35.00 per participant for 2012. Single- employer flat-rate premium rates are in-dexed for inflation. If a single-employer defined benefit plan has unfunded vested benefits, variable-rate premiums also apply at a rate of $9 per $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits divided by the number of participants. Variable-rate pre-miums are not indexed for inflation. For pur-poses of determining variable-rate pre-miums, unfunded vested benefits are equal to the excess (if any) of (1) the plan’s funding target for the year, as determined under the minimum funding rules, but taking into ac-count only vested benefits, over (2) the fair market value of plan assets. In determining the plan’s funding target for this purpose, the interest rates used are segment rates de-termined as under the minimum funding rules, but determined on a monthly basis, rather than using a 24-month average of cor-porate bond rates. In the case of a multiemployer defined ben- efit plan, flat-rate premiums apply at a rate of $9.00 per participant for 2012. Multiem-ployer flat-rate premium rates are indexed for inflation and are expected to increase to $10 for 2013. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT No provision. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT The conference agreement increases PBGC premiums for single-employer plans and multiemployer plans. Single-employer plan flat-rate premiums are increased to $42 per participant for 2013 and $49 per participant for 2014 with indexing thereafter. For plan years beginning after 2012, the rate for variable-rate premiums ($9 per $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits) is indexed and the per-participant variable-rate premium is subject to a limit.

In addition, the rate for variable-rate premiums per $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits is increased by $4 for 2014 and another $5 for 2015. These in-creases are applied to the rate applicable for the preceding year (that is, $9 as indexed for the preceding year per $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits) and indexing continues to apply thereafter. Multiemployer plan flat-rate premiums are increased by $2 per participant for 2013. B. Improvements of PBGC (secs. 40231–40234 of the conference agreement and ERISA sec. 4002, new sec. 4004 and sec. 4005)—Draft of 6/27/12, 9:00 PM PRESENT LAW The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (‘‘PBGC’’), which was created by the Em-ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (‘‘ERISA’’), insures benefits provided under defined benefit plans covered by ERISA, collects premiums with respect to such plans, and manages assets and pays benefits with respect to certain terminated plans. PBGC’s purposes are to encourage the continuation and maintenance of voluntary private defined benefit plans, provide timely and uninterrupted payment of pension bene-fits to participants and beneficiaries, and maintain premiums at the lowest level con-sistent with carrying out its obligations under ERISA. 149 PBGC is administered by a director, who is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. PBGC’s board of directors consists of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Commerce, with the Secretary of Labor serving as chair. An advisory com-mittee has been established for the purpose of advising the PBGC as to various policies and procedures. ERISA contains general pro-visions as to the board of directors and advi-sory committee. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT No provision. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT PBGC governance improvement The conference agreement expands the ERISA provisions relating to the PBGC board of directors, advisory committee, di-rector and other PBGC officials. With respect to the board of directors, the conference agreement addresses timing and procedures for meetings (including a joint meeting with the advisory committee). It also ensures that the PBGC inspector gen-eral has direct access to the board, clarifies the role of the General Counsel, and provides authority to the board to hire its own em-ployees, experts and consultants as may be required to enable the board to perform its duties. The conference agreement includes specific rules on conflicts of interest with re-spect to the board of directors and the direc-tor of PBGC and provides for the PBGC to have a risk management officer. It further clarifies that the PBGC board of directors is ultimately responsible for overseeing PBGC and that the director is directly accountable to the board of directors and can be removed by the board of directors or the president. It also sets the director’s term at five years un-less removed before the expiration of the term by the President or the board of direc-tors. The conference agreement states the sense of Congress that (1) the board of directors should form committees, including an audit committee and an investment committee composed of at least two members, to en-hance the overall effectiveness of the board, and (2) the advisory committee should pro-vide the board with policy recommendations regarding changes to the law that would be beneficial to the PBGC or the voluntary pri-vate pension system. The conference agreement also directs the PBGC, not later than 90 days after enact-ment, to contract with the National Acad-emy of Public Administration to conduct a study of the PBGC to include (1) a review of governance structures of organizations (gov-ernmental and nongovernmental) that are analogous to the PBGC and (2) recommenda-tions with respect to various topics relating to the board of directors, such as composi-tion, procedures, and policies to enhance Congressional oversight. The results of the study are to be reported within a year of ini-tiation of the study to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Education and the Workforce and Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives. Participant and plan sponsor advocate The conference agreement establishes a new Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate. The Advocate is chosen by the Board of Di-rectors from the candidates nominated by the advisory committee. This individual will act as a liaison between the corporation and participants in terminated pension plans. The Advocate will ensure that participants receive everything they are entitled to under the law. The Advocate will also provide plan sponsors with assistance in resolving dis-putes with the corporation. Each year, the Advocate will provide a report on their ac-tivities to the Committee on Health, Edu-cation, Labor, and Pensions and Committee on Finance of the Senate, the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representa-tives summarizing the issues raised by par-ticipants and plan sponsors and making rec-ommendations for changes to improve the system. Quality control procedures for the PBGC The conference agreement states that the PBGC will contract with an outside agency (such as the Social Security Administration) to conduct an annual review of the Corpora-tion’s Single-Employer and Multiemployer Pension Insurance Modeling Systems (‘‘PIMS’’). The first reviews will be initiated no later than 3 months after the enactment of this Act. The conference agreement also states that the PBGC will make its own efforts to de-velop review policies to examine actuarial work, management, and record keeping. Fi-nally, the conference agreement instructs the PBGC to provide a specific report ad-dressing outstanding recommendations made by the Office of the Inspector General (‘‘OIG’’) relating to the Policy, Research, and Analysis Department and the Benefits Administration and Payment Department. Line of credit repeal The conference agreement repeals section 4005(c) of ERISA, which provides authority for the PBGC to issue notes or other obliga-tions in an amount up to $100,000,000. Natural resource provisions Secure rural schools The conference report includes Senate lan- guage that extends by one year, through fis-cal year 2012, the Secure Rural Schools pro-gram. The program funds county outlays for public schools, road improvement and main-tenance projects, and forest restoration and improvement projects in and around Na-tional Forests. The conference report clari-fies that funds for eligible Title III projects under the program must be obligated by the end of the following fiscal year but not nec-essarily initiated. Payment-in-lieu of taxes The conference report also includes Senate language to extend by one year, through fis-cal year 2013, full funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program. The program pro-vides federal payments to local governments to help offset losses in property taxes due to nontaxable federal land within their bound-aries. Gulf coast restoration The conference report modifies a Senate provision related to Gulf Coast restoration known as the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourism Opportunities and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act of 2012 (RESTORE Act). The provision establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund and places in the Trust Fund 80% of all civil penalties paid by responsible parties in connection with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Funding may be used to invest in projects and activities to restore the long- term health of the coastal ecosystem and local economies in the Gulf Coast Region, which includes the states of Mississippi, Lou-isiana, Alabama, Florida, and Texas. A por-tion of the funds will be allocated directly and equally to the five Gulf Coast states for ecological and economic recovery along the coast.

Phased retirement PRESENT LAW Under current law, Federal agencies may offer part-time employment to retirement- eligible workers, but the employee may not begin receiving accrued pension benefits. Currently, Federal employees face one of three choices upon reaching retirement age: (1) voluntarily retire and collect an annuity based on the pension computation formula, (2) continue to work full time, in most cases increasing the number of service years used in calculating their pension, or (3) volun-tarily retire and return to Federal employ-ment as a reemployed annuitant. As a result, most experienced Federal employees elect to retire. Under Internal Revenue Code section 72(t), certain distributions from a qualified retire-ment plan prior to age 59 1⁄2are subject to an additional tax of 10 percent of the taxable amount of the distribution. HOUSE BILL No provision. SENATE AMENDMENT The Senate amendment provides the Office of Personnel Management the authority to establish a phased retirement program for qualified Federal employees. The amend-ment allows Federal employees to retire from a portion of their full time employment and receive a prorated pension for that serv-ice. During phased retirement, Federal em-ployees may work 20 to 80 percent of their full-time schedule and continue to receive a prorated salary and pension credit for the time worked. At least 20 percent of the time worked must be used to mentor new employ-ees. When the phased retiree fully retires, VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:00 Jul 03, 2012 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00442 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD12\RECFILES\H28JN2.REC H28JN2bjneal on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4601 June 28, 2012 their annuity would be adjusted, increasing the employee’s lifetime retirement income. The Senate amendment excludes from eligi-bility law enforcement officers, firefighters, nuclear materials couriers, air traffic con-trollers, customs and border protection offi-cers, or members of the Capital Police or Su-preme Court Police. CONFERENCE REPORT The conference report follows the Senate amendment with three changes. First, Postal Service employees are exempted from the re-quirement to spend 20 percent of their time mentoring. Second, the provision provides that certain law enforcement officers such as Customs and Border Protection Officers hired before 2008 (when they were granted law-enforcement type status which makes them ineligible for phased retirement under the Senate Amendment because they are subject to mandatory retirement) are eligi-ble for phased retirement. Finally, the con-ference agreement provides an exception to the additional tax under section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code for distributions from federal retirement plans to qualified phased retirees. Effective Date —The provision is effective on the date the implementing regulations are issued by the Director of the Office of Per-sonnel Management. Technical correction to the disaster recovery FMAP provision The ACA included a provision known as the ‘disaster-recovery FMAP’ designed to help states adjust to drastic changes in FMAP following a statewide disaster. Once triggered, the policy would provide assist-ance for as many as seven years following the disaster, as long as the state continued to experience an FMAP drop of more than three percentage points. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 cor-rected the formula. This policy moves the ef-fective date to October 1, 2012 and adjusts the formula for fiscal year 2013. Ocean freight differential The United States provides humanitarian food aid to developing countries. This assist-ance is subject to an additional cargo pref-erence, which requires 75% of food assistance be shipped from U.S. flagged vessels. The Maritime Administration at the Department of Transportation is required to reimburse the U.S. agencies that sponsor food aid ship-ments for the increased costs associated with the U.S. flag shipping requirement. This pro-posal would reduce to 50% the incremental ocean freight differential, which would re-duce the amount of quarterly payments made by Maritime Administration at the De-partment of Transportation. Abandoned mine land This proposal would cap abandoned mine land (AML) reclamation payments to states that have completed all high-priority aban-doned coal mine reclamation projects. Under this proposal, payments to those states (cer-tified states) would be capped at $15 million annually.

Congressional RecordUNUMEPLURIBUS United States of America PROCEEDINGS AND DE BATES OF THE 112th CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor. .S4689 Vol. 158 WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JUNE 28, 2012 No. 99 Senate The Senate met at 9:30 a.m. and was called to order by the Honorable T OM UDALL , a Senator from the State of New Mexico. PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of- fered the following prayer: Let us pray. God of liberty, as our Nation pre- pares to celebrate its independence, we thank You that the rights of its citi-zens come from You. We praise You not only for the unalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence and Con-stitution but for the liberty we have in You: freedom from guilt, sin, addiction, and fear. Use our lawmakers to protect and de- fend the freedoms for which so many have given their lives. Inspire our Sen-ators to keep Your teachings in their hearts so that they may live for You. We commit this day to You and thank You in advance for Your pres-ence and power. We pray in Your great Name. Amen. f PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Honorable T OMUDALL led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please read a communication to the Senate from the President pro tempore (Mr. I NOUYE ). The assistant legislative clerk read the following letter: U.S. S ENATE , PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE , Washington, DC, June 28, 2012. To the Senate: Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby appoint the Honorable T OMUDALL , a Senator from the State of New Mexico, to perform the duties of the Chair. D ANIEL K. INOUYE , President pro tempore. Mr. UDALL of New Mexico thereupon assumed the chair as Acting President pro tempore. f RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The majority leader is recog-nized. f SMALL BUSINESS JOBS AND TAX RELIEF ACT—MOTION TO PROCEED Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 341, S. 2237. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The clerk will report the motion. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 341, S. 2237, a bill to provide a temporary income tax credit for increased payroll and extend bonus depreciation for an additional year, and for other purposes. f SCHEDULE Mr. REID. Mr. President, the next hour will be divided between the Re-publicans and Democrats. The Repub-licans will control the first half and the majority will control the final half. It was last night, but just barely, when we finally worked out some agreement on a piece of legislation we are dealing with. The House posted that last night just before midnight to meet their rules. It includes the trans-portation conference and flood insur-ance and student loans in one package. I say to all of my Senators that we are going to finish this before we leave. I hope we can do it today. We certainly can if the will is there. Otherwise, if it takes tomorrow or whenever, we have to finish the bill. I know everyone has a lot of work to do, but we have to fin- ish this legislation. The student loan program expires at the end of the month. The highway program has to be completed by the end of the month. The work that has been done has been hard. I met with the Democratic chairs yesterday at noon. I explained to ev-eryone that we were trying to work our way through this. These are veteran legislators, the chairmen of all of the committees here in the Senate. We talked a lot about compromise being what legislation is all about. Legisla-tion is the art of compromise, con-sensus building, but when it comes right down to doing that, it is hard for Senators to give up what they want. But this is a bill that affects almost 3 million people. That is just the trans-portation part of it—the flood part, 7 million people, and the student loan, 7 million people. So everyone had to give a little bit or we could not have gotten this done. I am terribly disappointed on a part of what did not get done. I have always been a big fan of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I do not have a bet-ter friend in the world than Ken Sala-zar. This is something he wanted so very much, but we could not get it done. So there is a lot of disappoint-ment in many different areas. But this is legislation at its best. I say that purposefully. It is hard to get these pieces of legislation done, but we got it done. And as I said, we are going to work through the process. With the Senate being such that it is, people can hold measures up, but they cannot hold them up forever. So we are going to work through this. It is for the better-ment of our country if we complete this legislation as quickly as possible. MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR —S. 3342 Mr. REID. Mr. President, S. 3342 is at the desk and due for its second reading. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The clerk will read the title of the bill for the second time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4690 June 28, 2012 The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 3342) to improve information se- curity, and for other purposes. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ob- ject to any further proceedings with re-spect to this matter at this time. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Objection is heard. The bill will be placed on the calendar. HEALTH CARE Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a lot going on in Washington today. I so admire the Supreme Court’s ability to keep everything quiet. I mean, it is really incredible that we are going to have two major decisions this week— one dealing with immigration, one dealing with health care—and there has not been a single word that has come out of the Supreme Court. I am so impressed. That is the way it has al-ways been, and I hope it stays that way. Today the Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality of the land-mark health reform that made afford-able, quality care a right for every American. Millions of Americans are already seeing the benefits of this law—I repeat, millions of Americans. The Democrats are very proud that we stood for the right of every man, woman, and child to lifesaving medical care instead of standing for insurance companies that worry more about making money than making people better. The Supreme Court’s decision, being a lawyer myself—I know the Presiding Officer was the chief legal officer for the State of New Mexico, the attorney general—when you are in the area of law and are a lawyer, whatever the Court does, you accept that. That is our form of government. We are a na-tion of laws, not a nation of men. So whatever the Court does, we will work through that. If they uphold it, that is great. If they do not uphold it, what-ever it is, we stand ready, willing, and able to work to make sure Americans have the ability to get health care when they are sick. I look forward to the opinion coming out in the next half hour or so, and we will see what that holds. I know that will cause a lot of interest here in the Senate, but we cannot take our eyes off what we have to do today; that is, fig-ure a way forward on these other mat-ters with which we have to deal—flood insurance, student loans, and the big Transportation bill. RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Under the previous order, the fol-lowing hour will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with the Republicans controlling the first half and the ma-jority controlling the final half. The Senator from Wyoming is recog- nized. DEBT AND DEFICIT Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I come to floor to talk about a bit of a crisis the United States is in right now. We are out of money, but we are not recog-nizing that we are out of money. We must make that realization soon. We are going to have to do some work for this country to keep it operating so that the next generation has the same hope as the present generation. I think the best example of where we are is probably this highway bill. High-ways are important to this country. We need them to get from one place to an-other. We need them to move the goods across this country to keep the econ-omy going—highways are extremely important. Highways have always been funded from a gas tax, until now. Using different funding is a prime example of what is about to happen in all of the bills that we do because we have run out of money and we haven’t taken the necessary steps to solve that crisis. When the highway bill came to the Finance Committee, I suggested that we ought to change the gas tax so that there was an inflationary rate added each year for the following year. That was the least that I could think of to do for highways. It would have added half a cent a gallon. The price fluc-tuates at the pump more than half a cent a day. I have to tell you, though, that I really thought there would be strong support for doing something like that, taking a minimal step. I had the amendment devised so that it could be changed easily to increase that amount. The Simpson-Bowles deficit commission said—and this was over a year and a half ago—that for the next 3 years, we needed to raise the gas tax 5 cents per year for 3 years. So we real-ly ought to be at 7 1⁄2cents or 10 cents in increase already. Now, if we did that, the highway bill could be funded from highway funds. And that is a user fee. If you drive, you buy gas. If you buy gas, you pay for the highways on which you drive. I have been talking about this ever since we started on the highway bill, and I have not had anybody say to me: You are wrong, we should not raise the gas tax. I was really surprised. I thought there would be a huge outcry and that I would be in a lot of trouble for suggesting a raise in the gas tax. But America understands we are broke better than Congress understands. Both parties told me we would not vote on my amendment. And we didn’t vote on that amendment in committee, and we didn’t vote on that amendment on the floor. Of course, by my count, I think I had two Democrats supporting me and two Republicans supporting me, but we didn’t even really get to de-bate it. We should debate it. We should go to the logical spot for highway money, the spot that through the his-tory of highways has been used to fund highways. So where are we getting the money? Well, we did raise the tax on people who have pensions, and that is very im- portant. There is a trust fund—the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has a trust fund to see that if a com-pany goes out of business and it had promised pensions, then the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s trust fund makes up part of that. They do not make up all of it, but they make it part of it. So it is an insurance policy for people across America who have pensions. And we said: That needs a lit-tle bit more of a jolt. So we did a cou-ple of things. One of the things was to do some smoothing so companies would not have to put quite as much money into the fund, and therefore they would have maybe more profit, and on the profit they would pay taxes, and we can steal those taxes to put in the highway trust fund so that we can build the highways. We have never sto-len money to pay for highways before. Never use the Pension Benefit Guar-anty trust before. But this bill does that. And then there is another little bit of money that comes right out of the Pension Benefit Guarantee trust fund that goes into the highway bill. That is the wrong way to do business. We should not violate trust funds. Wait until the seniors who said ‘‘don’t touch my Social Security’’ real-ize that Social Security is a trust fund and that we are stealing from trust funds. I think we will hear a furor across this country that will be un-matched if Social Security is touched. So we are not touching that one—yet. We have maxed out our credit cards. You know what a maxed-out credit card is. That is when you buy some-thing and the clerk says: I am sorry, but there is a hold on your card. When you check on it, you find out that you have so much debt with that credit card company that they are not going to let you charge any more. Well, we have maxed out a lot of our credit cards. We are relying on foreign coun-tries to help us out with our debt. There is a problem in Europe right now. The euro is having a real tough strain. Eight of the banks that have a lot of euros have invested that in U.S. bonds because we are the safest place in the world. But if those banks col-lapse, they will need their money. Be-tween those eight euro banks and the four Japanese banks, that is 40 percent of the money, almost 40 percent of the money we borrow from other countries in order to keep our government going. We are at $16 trillion worth of debt. What is worse, we have quadrupled the bottom line on the Federal Reserve. We have made money—we have printed money to four times the amount of money we had 3 years ago. We are facing some really difficult times, and we are going to have to deed up to those. One of those ways would be to raise the gas tax and to do the high-way bill the way the highway bill ought to be done. Now, I mention these trust funds, and I mention them for a very specific rea-son; that is, they found a trust fund VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:58 Jun 28, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.011 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4691 June 28, 2012 they could violate. They did it very cleverly. They did not mention it to anybody who is going to be affected by the trust fund. Fortunately, there were some diligent people who took a look at that highway trust fund bill, and they said: Wow, they are going after abandoned mine land money in this bill. That is an abandoned mine land trust fund. The money comes from coal that is mined, and the money, the tax on that coal, is supposed to go to fix aban-doned mines across the country. The conference report’s drafters found $700 million in that trust fund. That trust fund hasn’t maxed out its credit cards because, so far, we are still mining coal in this country, and so far there is money going into it. But there are uses for that money that need to be achieved. It helps fix abandoned mine lands. Another use is taking care of orphan miners. I men-tioned the pension folks before; when their company goes out of business, they get a little help. Under the aban-doned mine land trust fund, if a coal company goes out of business and the miners don’t have any health insurance then part of this abandoned mine land money goes to make them whole in the health insurance area. This system was part of a grand coa- lition that came together to solve some problems that are involved with min-ing in America. The companies and the employees and the States that were in-volved said this probably isn’t the per-fect solution, but it helps a lot of peo-ple, so we were going to do it, and we did it. We were able to override a point of order on the budget in order to maintain that trust fund and move the money from the trust fund to where it was supposed to be used. For more than a decade, the money wasn’t even taken out of the trust fund, and do you know why? Anytime I asked about it and said we needed some of the money, the government said: Oh, I am sorry. You will have to put some money in there so we can take the money out. I said: What kind of a trust fund do you have to put money into twice before you can get money out? The money already went in there once before. Here is how it works. The money goes into bonds and the bonds go into the drawer and the money gets spent. Think about that. Seniors have been complaining about the Social Se-curity trust fund and how we have been spending money from the Social Secu-rity trust fund. They were more clever than most people who are involved in trust funds because they figured it out. The Social Security trust fund has a whole bunch of bonds in the drawer. It doesn’t have money in the drawer. But don’t worry, those bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, and Europe is about to have a huge problem. It is kind of interesting. In America, every single man, woman, and child owes more than $49,000 in national debt—and it is growing daily. In one meeting I attended, I mentioned that figure and somebody said: Can I pay my $49,000 and not be responsible for the rest of it? I said that is not the way it works. Even if we could do that, that is not the way it works. So it is $49,000 for every man, woman, and child in the United States. If a child is born today, we can tag him or her with a $49,000 debt immediately. Why is that significant? You have probably watched Greece and Italy. Greece and Italy had to do 19 percent cuts. They cut pension plans 19 per-cent. They cut employees 19 percent. They cut the number of employees 19 percent. They cut the services they provide by 19 percent. They cut every-thing by 19 percent. You probably saw there were some riots in their coun-tries. If we cut 19 percent, there would be riots in this country. Here is an in-teresting fact. In Italy, they only owe $40,000 per person. In Greece, they only owe $39,000 per person. We owe $49,000 per person. We are considered to be the safest place in the world to put your money, and I think that is right—at the moment—and it will change if we don’t act soon. If we keep doing what we are doing in the highway trust fund—and it shows better there than any other place I can think of—we won’t be a secure place to invest. The way we are fiddling with funds and shuffling credit cards so we are not using the maxed-out ones, has to stop, my friends. With the highway bill before us, the conferees did construct a bill so they could get quite a few votes on it. They put a limit on the amount of money certified states could get from the abandoned mine land trust fund. It doesn’t discriminate against very many States. It does discriminate against Wyoming, and so I make a plea that they not do that and remove the section of the bill. Trust fund money needs to go for what the trust fund said the money would go for. Even if they decide to steal from Wy- oming—and I hope they don’t—but even if they do, the money ought to go into the other States that are a part of the trust fund that need to do mine clean up. Over the 10 years of the bill, it takes about $715 million worth of money from the abandoned mine land trust fun—10 years. I did mention 10 years. There is a reason I mentioned 10 years. This highway bill we are talking about doesn’t get all the money from all the places we are stealing from in a short enough period to pay for the highways we are going to build over the life of that bill. After the bill ex-pires and all those things have been built, we will still be trying to collect the money from the sources it has been stolen from in order to pay for what has already been built. OK. What hap-pens when we get to the end of this highway bill, and we are still waiting for all the places we stole the money from to get the money in? Where do we steal the next money from? We better raise the gas tax. We better take a look at what we are doing, and make changes. If there is a user fee—and that is what the gas tax is—if we use the highways, we buy gas; if we buy gas, we pay into the trust fund. We should use the user fee to pay for highways. We have an additional problem that is the user fee is probably diminishing be-cause there are cars that run on elec-tricity now, and that will probably be increasing. Alternative fuels will be in-creasing, and that will affect how much money goes into the trust fund. But just to meet the immediate needs, there needs to be something done, and stealing from other trust funds is not the way to do it. If we get in the habit of stealing from trust funds, Social Security will have to watch out. Of course, that will be the end of the road for a lot of people in this body if they start stealing from Social Security. But it ought to be the end of the road for people if they are stealing from other trust funds because it starts the habit, and we can’t afford that habit. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. The majority leader is recognized. AFFORDABLE CARE ACT Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy, I am pleased to see the Supreme Court put the rule of law ahead of partisan-ship and ruled that the affordable care act is constitutional. This is a long opinion. We know when we come back here after the elections there may be some work we need to do to improve the law, and we will do it together. But today millions of Ameri-cans are already seeing the benefits of the law we passed. Seniors are saving money on their prescriptions and checkups, children can no longer be de-nied insurance because they have a pre-existing condition—protection that will soon extend to every American. No longer will American families be a car accident or heart attack away from bankruptcy. Every Thursday I have a ‘‘Welcome to Washington.’’ Today we had a group of people from Nevada who have or have relatives who have cystic fibrosis. It has been so hard for these young people to get insurance. It is not going to be that way anymore. No longer will Americans live in fear of losing their health insurance because they lose a job. No longer will tens of millions of Americans rely on emergency room care or go without care entirely be-cause they have no insurance at all. Soon, virtually every man, woman, and child in America will have access to health insurance they can afford and the vital care they need. Passing the Affordable Care Act was the single greatest step in generations toward ensuring access to affordable, quality health care for every person in America, regardless of where they live or how much money they make.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4692 June 28, 2012 Unfortunately, Republicans in Con- gress continue to target the rights and benefits guaranteed under this law. They would like to give the power of life and death back to the insurance companies. Our Supreme Court has spoken. This matter is settled. No one thinks this law is perfect. The Presiding Officer doesn’t and neither do I. Democrats have proven we are willing to work with Republicans to improve whatever problems exist in this law or, in fact, any other law. Millions of Americans are struggling to find work today, and we know that. Our first priority must be to improve the economy. It is time for Republicans to stop refighting yesterday’s battles. Now that this matter is settled, let’s move on to other issues such as jobs. I note the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M CCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Republican leader is recog-nized. HEALTH CARE RULING Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, 21⁄2 years ago a Democratic President teamed up with a Democratically led Congress to force a piece of legislation on the American people they never asked for and that has turned out to be just as disastrous as many of us pre-dicted. Amid economic recession, a spi-raling Federal debt, and accelerated in-creases in government health spending, they proposed a bill that made all those problems worse. Americans were promised lower health care costs, and they are going up. Americans were promised lower premiums, and they are going up. Most Americans were promised their taxes wouldn’t change, and they are going up. Seniors were promised Medicare would be protected. It was raided to pay for a new entitlement instead. Americans were promised it would cre-ate jobs. The CBO predicts it will lead to nearly 1 million fewer jobs. Ameri-cans were promised they could keep their health plans if they liked it. Yet millions have learned they can’t. The President of the United States promised up and down that this bill was not a tax. This was one of the Democrats’ top selling points because they knew it would never have passed if they said it was a tax. The Supreme Court has spoken. This law is a tax. The bill was sold to the American peo-ple on a deception. It is not just that the promises about this law weren’t kept; it is that it made the problems it was meant to solve even worse. The supposed cure has proven to be worse than the disease. So the pundits will talk a lot about what they think today’s ruling means and what it doesn’t mean, but I can as- sure you this: Republicans will not let up whatsoever in our determination to repeal this terrible law and replace it with the kind of reforms that will truly address the problems it was meant to solve. Look, we have passed plenty of ter- rible laws around here that the Court finds constitutional. Constitutionality was never an argument to keep this law in place, and it is certainly not one we will hear from Republicans in Con-gress. There is only one way to truly fix ObamaCare—and only one way—and that is a full repeal that clears the way for commonsense, step-by-step reforms that protect Americans’ access to the care they need from the doctor they choose at a lower cost. That is pre-cisely what Republicans are committed to doing. The American people weren’t waiting on the Supreme Court to tell them whether they supported this law. That question was settled 2 1⁄2years ago. The more the American people have learned about this law, the less they have liked it. Now that the Court has ruled, it is time to move beyond the constitu-tional debate and focus on the primary reason this law should be fully repealed and replaced—because of the colossal damage it has already done to our health care system, to the economy, and to the job market. The Democrat’s health care law has made things worse. Americans wanted repeal, and that is precisely what we intend to do. Americans want us to start over, and today’s decision does nothing to change that. The Court’s ruling doesn’t mark the end of the de-bate. It marks a fresh start on the road to repeal. That has been our goal from the start. That is our goal now, and we plan to achieve it. The President has done nothing to address the problems of cost, care, and access. We will. I yield the floor. I suggest the ab- sence a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. W HITEHOUSE ). Without objection, it is so ordered. HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES ARMY STAFF SERGEANT ISRAEL NUANES Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, just last month we com-memorated Memorial Day. Memorial Day is a day of remembrance, a day of mourning, and a day of gratitude. It is a day when Americans from all walks of life gather to thank and honor the people we have lost, to honor the men and women who gave their lives in service to our country, and to acknowl-edge a debt that can never truly be paid. I rise today to honor Army SSG Israel Nuanes. Staff Sergeant Nuanes died on Saturday, May 12, while serv- ing in Kandahar Province in Afghani-stan. He was fatally injured by the det-onation of an improvised explosive de-vice. He was 38 years old. In the decade that our Nation has been at war in Afghanistan, thousands of men and women have volunteered to serve our country. In order to protect others, they put their own lives at risk. They leave their homes and their loved ones to defend the freedoms we hold dear. Nearly 2,000 of them, thus far, will not come home. Staff Sergeant Nuanes was from Las Cruces, NM. He lived most of his adult life as a soldier. He was assigned to the 741st Ordnance Company, 84th Explo-sive Ordnance Disposal Battalion, 71st Ordnance Group. He served two tours of duty in Iraq. After returning from Iraq in 2010, he enlisted for 6 more years. His unit deployed to Afghanistan ear-lier this year. Time and again he answered the call of his country. President Kennedy said: Stories of past courage . . . can teach, they can offer hope, they can provide inspiration. But, they cannot supply courage itself. For this, each man must look into his own soul. In Iraq, in Afghanistan, wherever his country needed him, Staff Sergeant Nuanes had that courage. Despite the danger, despite the risk, he went where his country sent him with commit-ment, with determination, and with an unflinching sense of duty. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Pur-ple Heart. There is sorrow in his death, but also inspiration in his life. This courageous soldier loved his family. He loved his country. He made the ultimate sacrifice defending it. He leaves behind two children, Israel and Laurissa. He has left them far too soon. Abraham Lincoln said it best almost 150 years ago. There is little our words can do to add or detract on these sol-emn occasions. But I offer my deepest sympathies to the family of SSG Israel Nuanes. We honor his courage, we honor his sacrifice, and we mourn your loss. HEALTH CARE Mr. President, we have all heard the historic ruling on the Affordable Care Act today. I know the Presiding Officer has been following this closely. We all have been following this closely. The Supreme Court has upheld the Afford-able Care Act. The Affordable Care Act has moved us forward, but now the call on the Re-publican side is for full repeal of the law. So it seems their legislative objec-tive is going to be to introduce a piece of legislation—and we will have a vote on the Senate floor—for full repeal. I wish to remind New Mexicans in par-ticular what is at stake when we talk about full repeal. First of all, insurance companies today, with the Affordable Care Act in place, cannot deny coverage if a person has a preexisting condition. That is something that is tremendously impor-tant to New Mexicans. If someone has a young child who has cancer and they VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:58 Jun 28, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.004 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4693 June 28, 2012 have to get insurance, they can’t deny them because of a preexisting condi-tion. There is no doubt that we can im- prove upon the law, but New Mexico has already received more than $200 million in grants and loans to establish an insurance exchange, strengthen community health centers, train new health professionals, and so much more. Since passing the law, more than 26,000 young adults under 26 years old have been allowed to stay on their par-ents’ insurance plans. Almost 20,000 New Mexico seniors on Medicare re-ceived a rebate to help cover prescrip-tion costs when they hit the doughnut hole in 2010. And 285,000 New Mexicans with private health insurance no longer have to pay a deductible or copay for preventive health care such as physicals, cancer screenings, and vaccinations. More is yet to come under the Affordable Care Act. So this is the contrast: There are some who are calling for full repeal; there are others of us who recognize that there are significant accomplish-ments, and we want to work further with the other side in a bipartisan way to put aside partisanship and move for-ward with improving our health care system. I note the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. HEALTH CARE DECISION Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this morning’s decision by the Supreme Court has clarified some things and has made other things more muddled. One, it has clarified the importance of the upcoming election on November 6, 2012. The only way to stop the overreaching by the Federal Government, including the President’s flawed health care bill, is to elect a new President and a Con-gress that will repeal and replace this fundamentally flawed law. Before the health care bill became law, the President repeatedly assured the American people he would not raise taxes on the middle class. He declared emphatically that the individual man-date was ‘‘absolutely not a tax in-crease.’’ But the Supreme Court has made absolutely clear the only way ObamaCare can be upheld as within the constitutional power of Congress is for it to be considered a tax increase, and a tax increase on every single Amer-ican, regardless of income. The President told us his health care law would reduce premiums by $2,500 for the average family. That was an-other broken promise. Last year, the average American family, with em-ployer-sponsored insurance, saw their premiums rise by $1,200. The case against this health care leg- islation is very simple: It relies on massive tax increases, job-killing regu- lations, and government coercion. It will place Washington bureaucrats be-tween patients and their doctors and it will cause millions of Americans to lose their current insurance coverage. So much for ‘‘if you like it, you can keep it.’’ And as we now know, ObamaCare has made the problem of rising health care costs worse, not bet-ter. For these reasons and more, we need to repeal this entire piece of legislation and start over. We all share the goal of expanding health care coverage, but there are good ways and bad ways to do it. The authors of ObamaCare chose a fundamentally flawed way: Yet another government takeover. Perhaps one of the most telling things Congress has done in the last 2 years is pass a bill under Medicare for prescription drug coverage for seniors. Rather than a government-run pro-gram, we created a marketplace for competition, where prescription pro-viders can compete for consumers’ favor by improved or lower cost and better service. Indeed, by using the cost discipline of a consumer-oriented approach to health care, that govern-ment program came in 40 percent under projected cost. That is the only time I know of in the health care field where the government has actually created a program that people like and that has come in significantly under cost. We cannot continue to cut health care payments to providers because, quite simply, fewer and fewer providers are going to provide that service. We know that is true in Medicare, where many seniors can’t find a doctor to take them as a patient because pro-viders won’t accept Medicare’s low re-imbursement rates. We know it is even worse for Medicaid patients, because that government program pays pro-viders a fraction of what they would be paid if they were simply covered by pri-vate insurance. All Americans should have access to high-quality coverage and high-quality care. The best way to make quality coverage and care more accessible is to reduce the cost. ObamaCare increases the cost. We need to reduce the cost and make it more affordable, and the best way to reduce cost is through pa-tient-driven reforms that increase transparency, eliminate government distortions, and boost private competi-tion. Those are the reforms Americans want, and those are the reforms they deserve. Unfortunately, President Obama has made clear he views health care reform as a vehicle for expanding the size of government and its intrusion into the decisions that should be reserved for patients in consultation with their pri-vate doctors. Time and time again the President has put ideology ahead of basic logic and sound economics. Therefore, to en-sure future health care reforms em-power patients and reduce cost and make it more affordable, we need to put a new President in the White House. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. H AGAN ). The Senator from Iowa. Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Sen-ate—the committee that drafted large portions of the Affordable Care Act—in looking back at all of the hearings we had, the long markup sessions, working across the aisle with Republicans, working with the administration, fi-nally getting it passed and signed into law, this is a great day. There has been a cloud hanging over this because of those who didn’t want to reform the health care system. They wanted to keep insurance companies in charge. Well, we said, no, we are going to change this; we are going to reform the system and make it work for peo-ple, not just for insurance companies. There are those out there who didn’t want to change, who didn’t want to re-form the system, and so they brought cases to court. And as we know, this issue has wound its way through the courts—some deciding yes and some de-ciding no—and then went to the Su-preme Court. I remember being in the Court this spring for the arguments on this law, and we have been waiting since for the Supreme Court to make its decision. Well, this morning, the Supreme Court gave a resounding confirmation that the Affordable Care Act is indeed con-stitutional. Some have been saying President Obama wins this or the Democrats win or the Republicans lose—that kind of thing. I don’t see it that way. What I see is that this is a great victory for the American people, for the businesses of America, and for our economy. That is what this is all about. It moves us forward so that every American—every single American—will have quality, af-fordable health care coverage—some-thing we have never done in this coun-try. That is why this is such a land-mark bill and such a landmark decision by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court’s decision allows us to move ahead and replaces what I have often called a sick-care system— a system that will maybe get to you, if you are lucky, in the emergency room if you are sick, but not one that gets to you before that to keep you healthy. That is what the Affordable Care Act is moving toward—a system of more pre-ventive health care, more promoting of wellness and keeping people healthy in the first place by giving them the cov-erage they can use to access affordable wellness and preventive health care. The Supreme Court has made it clear what we have known all along, that those who want to block this law and who are now clamoring to repeal it are on the wrong side of this issue. They are on the wrong side of history. We can go all the way back to those who didn’t want to have a Social Security System. They were on the wrong side VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:58 Jun 28, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.006 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4694 June 28, 2012 of history. There were those who didn’t want to have a Medicare system. They were on the wrong side of history. And those who want to repeal this law can stand with them. They can stand with them in history. But I think history has shown that every time we expand the rights of peo-ple to certain basic needs in people’s lives, we become a stronger country, a more unified country, a better country, with more opportunity for all. For those of us who believe that quality, affordable health care is a right and not a privilege, this is a great victory. I see that some in the House have scheduled a vote to repeal it after we get back from the Fourth of July break. They have already voted to re-peal it; I guess they are going to vote to repeal it again. They are on the wrong side of history. I call upon my Republican friends in the House and the Senate: It is over. This is constitu-tional. Now let’s work together to make it so that it is implemented and that it works for everyone. I say to my Republican friends that I have never said the Affordable Care Act is like the Ten Commandments, chiseled in stone for all eternity. I have often likened it to a starter home to which we could make some additions and some improvements as we go along. But at least that starter home has put a roof over our heads—a roof that will give quality affordable health care insurance to every American. So I say to my Republican friends, bring your toolkits if you want to make it better and improve it. Bring your tool-kits, don’t bring a sledgehammer. Don’t bring a sledgehammer to break it down and try to repeal it. So let’s work together, put politics behind us, and make this bill work for everyone, make it work for every American. The Jus-tices have spoken. Now it is time for us to get back to work to build a reformed health care system that works not just for the healthy and the wealthy but for all Americans. This is a victory. It is not a victory for President Obama. It is not a victory for my committee or anyone else around here. This is a victory to make sure that no one—no one in the future is ever denied health care coverage be-cause he or she got cancer, to make sure that no one in the future will be denied quality affordable health care coverage because they have diabetes. It is a victory for families who have had a child who needed intensive, very expensive health care coverage to make sure that child would live and grow and be able to take full part in our society, although sometimes those costs are extremely high. In the past, there have been annual limits, and if you went above that, you had to pay out of pocket. There were lifetime caps. How many women have I met in the past who have had breast cancer and had to have intensive treatments for a period of time but they bumped up against a lifetime cap. They had to pay out of their pocket. So this is a victory for them. It is a victory for families so that they don’t face life-time caps and annual caps. It is a vic-tory for every family in America to en-sure that their child can stay on their family’s policy until age 26. That is who wins here—ordinary hard-working families in America. It is a victory for hard-working families to make sure that insurance companies have to pro-vide—have to provide—cost-effective, lifesaving preventive care at no cost to get to people early on to keep them healthy in the first place. It is a vic-tory for working families so no longer do they have to choose between paying for health insurance or other critical family needs such as food, shelter, transportation, education. That is what this is about. That is what this victory is all about. It is a victory for American families. I say to those who now want to re- peal it, who are going to start to make a political issue out of this, you are on the wrong side of history. The Amer-ican people will now begin to take a look at this bill in a new light: that it is constitutional, it will be imple-mented, and what is in it for us? And I just went through what is in it for every American family. The American people will not want to go back. They will not want to repeal this law. There may be improvements we can make as we go along. That is fine. But I say woe to those who vote to repeal this bill. The American people will hold you ac-countable for being on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of progress, the wrong side of ensuring that every American family has quality affordable health care in America. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I come to the floor, as many of our col-leagues have done, to talk about this very significant and, for me at least, stunning U.S. Supreme Court decision on ObamaCare. First of all, I use the word ‘‘stunning,’’ not particularly be-cause of the outcome. I would not have been shocked at either outcome—up-holding the law or striking down the law. I considered both of those clear possibilities. I am stunned and shocked, somewhat confused, by the decision—by the nature of the decision, by the nature of the majority, and by the reasoning. I am not going to dwell on that. It is not my role or the role of other Sen-ators to second-guess it or to claim we have some authority to rewrite it. But I do find that doing backflips beyond the significant power of the Court to completely recharacterize the indi-vidual mandate and parts of the law as- sociated with it as a tax—it was never proposed as a tax. It was never debated as a tax. It was never written as a tax. It was never meant as a tax in any part of the ObamaCare debate or legislative action. So I certainly agree with Jus-tice Kennedy who said out loud from the bench, which I think is significant, that to read it ‘‘as a tax’’ is not just reading the law a certain way, it is re-writing the law. Judicial rewriting of tax policy, judicial writing of the law to create a tax, is particularly worri-some. I absolutely agree with that. I do think the majority, led trag- ically by Chief Justice Roberts, did backflips to rewrite the law in order to uphold it. I think that is very unfortu-nate. What it also means for the country and for the policy debate and for us in the Congress is at least two things, which I think are also very important. No. 1, it means that if this is a tax, this is a massive tax increase on the middle class, which stands full square against the clear and repeated campaign prom-ises of President Obama. So this is a huge tax increase, now that it is a tax, completely against everything he ran on and what he said over and over, campaigning for office. It also means something separate that is very significant. If this is all about taxes and spending, it means a different Congress next year—hope-fully, led by a different President—can repeal all of that with a simple major-ity of votes in the Senate through rec-onciliation. If this is all about taxes and spending, then it can all be undone through the reconciliation process. Of course, that is significant for one rea-son and one reason only: In the Senate, it means that lowers the requirement from 60 votes to a simple majority. If there is a Republican President, that would be 50 votes, plus the Vice Presi-dent as the tiebreaker. So my bottom line is simple. It was my bottom line yesterday before the opinion, it was my bottom line over the last several months, and it was my bottom line the day after Congress passed ObamaCare and the President signed it into law. It may be ruled con-stitutional, but it is still a bad idea that is making things worse. It is put-ting an all-powerful Federal Govern-ment between the patient and his or her doctor, and it is costing us an enor-mous amount of money as individuals, as citizens, as a society, and as a gov-ernment that we clearly cannot afford. Many of us made those arguments during the original debate. But I think all of those arguments have been vali-dated and are even more clearly true and compelling in the months since ObamaCare was passed, in particular, because costs have been going through the roof. The suggestion that this was going to save us money and not cost us extra money—even the suggestion of that argument—has gone out the win-dow. It is clear the opposite is true. In-dividual premiums have gone up as a VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:58 Jun 28, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.007 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4695 June 28, 2012 result, family premiums have gone up as a result, and costs to the govern-ment and to society have gone up as a result. It has made the already stag-gering problem of health care costs worse and worse. It has made health care for everyday Americans less and less affordable. Because of that, I cer-tainly renew my commitment to work with others to fully repeal ObamaCare lock, stock, and barrel. Under the Supreme Court’s decision today, I restate again that I think it is very significant since it is all about a tax and all about taxes and spending that can be addressed early next year with a simple majority in the Senate if there is a President Romney and a Re-publican Congress to do it. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi- dent, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi- dent, in light of the Supreme Court’s decision on the Affordable Care Act, I wanted to come to the floor today to bring just a few Rhode Island voices into the discussion that is taking place. One such person is a man from Provi- dence, RI, named Greg, who has a 16- year-old son named Will. Will has cys-tic fibrosis, which requires Will to spend several hours every day under-going the treatment that dreadful dis-ease requires. He sees a specialist four times a year to monitor the disease. He has daily prescriptions and treatments. Without this bill, Will and his father were looking at two problems: One, de-nial of coverage because Will’s cystic fibrosis was a preexisting condition; and, two, lifetime caps. For people like Will all around the country, this has been a real blessing because lifetime caps are forbidden and kids with preexisting conditions must be covered notwithstanding the pre-existing condition. So for Greg, the fa-ther in Providence, and his son Will, I want their voices to be heard today in not so much celebration but relief that what they have been provided by the health care law is still in place. Another voice to bring to the Senate floor is Olive. Olive is a senior citizen. She lives in Woonsocket, RI. Her hus-band has fairly serious Alzheimer’s and requires several medications to treat it. Until the Affordable Care Act came along, Olive and her husband fell in the doughnut hole and had to pay 100 cents on the dollar for the husband’s Alz-heimer’s medications while they were in the doughnut hole. When I ran for this office, one of the things I pledged to do was to work my heart out to close the doughnut hole. In the Affordable Care Act, it does close. Right now there is a 50-percent discount for Olive on her husband’s Alzheimer’s drugs when they are in the doughnut hole. For them that 50-per-cent discount means $2,400, which, for senior citizens who count on Social Se-curity in Woonsocket, makes a dif-ference in the quality of their lives. Overall, it is up to $13.9 billion in doughnut hole discounts for seniors and people with disabilities as a result of this bill. That makes a big difference in every single one of those lives, just like Olive and her husband. A third voice I wish to bring to the Senate is Brianne, who is a 22-year-old graduate of the University of Rhode Is-land, out and working part time as a physical therapist, but her job does not provide health insurance. She would be going without entirely, hanging her fortunes on chance, as the President recently said, if it were not for the Af-fordable Care Act. She and 9,000 young adults in Rhode Island have achieved coverage as a result of this bill by being able to get on their parents’ poli-cies. Danny is also a recent college grad- uate living in Providence, having grad-uated from Brown University. He is passionate about renewable energy planning but couldn’t make the health insurance work. Because of the Afford-able Care Act, like Brianne, he is able to be on his parents’ health insurance coverage and have that peace of mind. The last story I will tell is about a small business owner named Geoff in Providence who provides health care insurance for his employees because he believes it is the right thing to do. He qualified for the law’s small business health care tax credit, so he has seen a significant advantage to his small busi-ness from this provision. I think it is a relief to put this quar- rel behind us, to be able to move on and deal with the economic issues we face. As we do, I wish to make sure that Greg and Olive and Brianne and Geoff and Danny were all heard here on the floor today, because they are Rhode Islanders in whose lives this bill has made a real and practical dif-ference. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor. I see the distin- guished Senator from Wyoming ready to speak. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Madam President, it is dis- appointing that the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the new health care law. Just because it is con-stitutional doesn’t mean it is the best policy, the perfect policy, or even good policy. And just because the Court upheld the law does not change the fact that the American people have over-whelming concerns about it—not all of it but a lot of it. In fact, the Court affirmed that the new health care law is a massive tax increase on the American people. Con-gress must get serious about fixing our broken health care system. We can start by changing this misguided health care law that has divided the American people and failed to address rising health care costs. Congress should work together to make com-monsense, step-by-step health reforms that can truly lower the cost of health care. I was pleased to see that the Su-preme Court narrowed the Medicaid ex-pansion because States can’t afford them. Hard-working Americans are still struggling in this anemic economy and need real action to make health care more affordable. Reforms do not have to start here in Washington. Our Nation’s States are laboratories of democracy and can play a significant role in addressing the health care crisis in America. Gov-ernors are in a special position to un-derstand the unique problems facing their States, and fixing health care, like most problems facing our Nation, cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution. Efforts underway by Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels provide a great example of what different States are working on. He is moving forward with the Healthy Indiana initiative, which is an affordable insurance program for unin-sured State adults aged 19 to 64. Outside Washington, some health in- surance companies have already stated they will adopt several reasonable pro-visions to lower health care costs. These include allowing young adults to be covered until age 26 while on their parent’s plan, not charging patients copays for certain care, not imposing lifetime limits, and not implementing retroactive cancellation of health care coverage. They said they would do that regardless of how the Supreme Court case came out. One of the most effective ways Con- gress can address the rising costs of health care is to focus on the way it is delivered as part of the Nation’s cur-rent cost-driven and ineffective patient care system. America’s broken fee-for- service structure is driving our Na-tion’s health care system further down-ward, and tackling this issue is a good start to reining in rising health care costs. What is fee for service? This method of payment encourages pro-viders to see as many patients and pre-scribe as many treatments as possible but does nothing to reward providers who help keep patients healthy. These misaligned incentives drive up costs and hurt patient care. The new health care law championed by President Obama and congressional Democrats did very little to address these problems. The legislation instead relied on a massive expansion of unsustainable government price con-trols found in fee-for-service Medicare. If we want to address the threat posed by out-of-control entitlement spend-ing, we need to restructure Medicare to better align incentives for providers and beneficiaries. This will not only lower health care costs, it will also im-prove the quality of care for millions of Americans. In the health care bill, we took $500 billion out of Medicare and put it into new programs. Then we ap-pointed an unelected board to suggest VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:58 Jun 28, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.014 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4696 June 28, 2012 cuts that can be made, and the only place left for cuts are providers, hos-pitals, home health care, nursing homes, and hospice care. I don’t think that is where we want to be cutting Medicare. Shifting the health care delivery sys- tem from one that pays and delivers services based on volume to one that pays and delivers services based on value is an idea that unites both Re-publicans and Democrats. We have been mentioning a number of simple steps that can be taken while Congress weighs the larger fixes needed for pre-ventive care. We can encourage insur-ers to offer plans that focus on deliv-ering health care services by reducing copays for high-value services and in-creasing copays for low-value or exces-sive services. Consumer-directed health plans provide another avenue for link-ing financial and delivery system in-centives and have the potential to re-duce health care spending by $57 billion a year. Bundled payments will support more efficient and integrated care. All of these options have already been uti-lized by a number of private sector firms with great success. The Federal Government should be willing to sup-port viable reforms where it is needed, but also refrain from handcuffing inno-vative private sector designs with ex-cessive regulations or narrow political interests. Our Nation has made great strides in improving the quality of life for all Americans, and we need to remember that every major legislative issue that has helped transform our country was forged in the spirit of compromise and cooperation. These qualities are essen-tial to the success and longevity of cru-cial programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. But when it comes to health care decisions being made in Wash-ington lately, the only thing the gov-ernment is doing is increasing par-tisanship and legislative gridlock. I wish to leave the Senate with some words of wisdom from one of our de-parted Members, and that is Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat from New York, who served in this body. He said in 2001, shortly before he retired: Never pass major legislation that affects most Americans without real bipartisan sup-port. It opens the door to all kinds of polit-ical trouble. Senator Moynihan correctly noted that the party that didn’t vote for it will criticize the resulting program whenever things go wrong. More impor-tantly, he predicted the measure’s very legitimacy will be constantly ques-tioned by a large segment of the popu-lation who will never accept it unless it is shown to be a huge success. That is a quote from Daniel Patrick Moynihan, former Senator. Truer words were never spoken. We have seen each of these scenarios play out over the past 2 years as the new health care law polarized the Nation. I hope this distinguished body has the courage to learn from our mistakes, be-cause our Nation needs health care re- form, but it has to be done the right way. Providing Americans with access to high-quality affordable health care is something I am confident Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree on. Two-and-a-half years ago, a Demo- cratic President teamed up with a Democratic-led Congress with only Democratic votes to force a piece of legislation on the American people that they never asked for and that has turned out to be as disastrous as pre-dicted. How so? Amid an economic re-cession, a spiraling Federal debt, and accelerating increases in government health spending, they proposed a bill that has made the problems worse. Americans were promised lower health care costs. They are going up. Americans were promised lower pre-miums. They are going up. Most Amer-icans were promised their taxes wouldn’t change. They are going up. Seniors were promised Medicare would be protected. It was raided to pay for a new entitlement instead. Americans were promised it would create jobs. The CBO predicts it will lead to nearly 1 million fewer jobs. Americans were promised they can keep their plan if they liked it, yet millions have learned that they can’t. And the President of the United States himself promised up and down that this bill was not a tax. That was one of the Democrats’ top selling points, because they knew it would never get passed if they said it was a tax. The Supreme Court spoke today. It said it is a tax. This law was sold to the American people under deception. But it is not just that the promises about this law were not kept, it is that it has made the problems it was meant to solve even worse. The supposed cure has proved to be worse than the disease. We pass plenty of terrible laws around here that the Court finds con-stitutional. We need to do some com-monsense, step-by-step reforms that protect Americans’ access to the care they need, from the doctor they choose, and at a lower cost. That is precisely what I am committed to doing. The American people weren’t waiting on the Supreme Court to tell them whether they supported this law. That question was settled 2 1⁄2years ago. The more the American people have learned about this law, the less they have liked it. Now that the Court has ruled, it is time to move beyond the constitu-tional debate and focus on the primary flaws of this law because of the colossal damage it is doing and has already done to the health care system and to the economy and to the job market, which needs to be turned around. There are things that need to be done and can be done. I yield the floor and suggest the ab- sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. M CCASKILL ). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I cannot remember another day when so many Americans were waiting for the Supreme Court to rule, but today was one of those days all across America. Everyone understood that a decision just across the street this morning by the nine members of the Supreme Court was historic and politically sig-nificant. The Supreme Court handed down a decision, consisting of 193 pages, with all of the major opinions—dissenting and concurring opinions included—in the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius. We knew this was a case to decide the con-stitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. That, of course, was one of Presi-dent Obama’s first major legislative undertakings when he was elected President. Many of us who were part of the Senate and the House during this debate will never forget it. I have been lucky enough to represent my great State of Illinois for quite some time, in both the House and Senate, but there has never been a more historic and ex-hausting debate than the one that pre-ceded the final vote on the Affordable Care Act. The last vote in the Senate actually occurred on Christmas Eve, and then we hurried away from here to be with our families, knowing we had done something of great historic im-port. Behind this decision was my human experience that most every one of us has had at one time or another. I can recall in my own family experience that moment when I was a brandnew dad and a law student—not exactly a great combination in planning, but that was my life. Our daughter was born with a serious problem. We were here in Washington, DC, and we were uninsured—no health insurance, a brandnew baby, and I was a law stu-dent. I can remember leaving George-town Law School a few blocks from here to go over to Children’s Memorial Hospital to sit in a room with all of the other parents who had no health insur-ance. It was a humbling experience, waiting for your number to be called for a brandnew doctor whom you had never seen before to sit down and ask you again for the 100th time the his-tory of your child. You never feel more helpless as a parent in that cir-cumstance—to have no health insur-ance and to hope and pray you are still doing the best for your child. That ex-perience is one that literally millions of Americans have every single day, VerDate Mar 15 2010 23:58 Jun 28, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.015 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4697 June 28, 2012 with no health insurance, praying that they will get through the day without an accident, a diagnosis, or something that is going to require medical care. What we tried to do with the Afford-able Care Act was twofold: first, to ex-pand the reach of health insurance cov-erage to more families; second, to make health insurance itself more af-fordable and more reasonable. Let me start with this question of af- fordable and reasonable health insur-ance. Similar to my family, many fam-ilies had children born with a prob-lem—asthma, diabetes, cancer, heart issues. These are children who need special care, and many times families, when they turned to ask for health in-surance, were turned away. That is not fair and it is not what we need in America. We need health insurance to protect those families, and that is one of the major provisions in the Afford-able Care Act. Secondly, many people don’t realize until it is too late that their old health insurance policies had lifetime limits. There was only so much money the in-surance company would pay. People who got into challenging medical situ-ations, with expensive health care needs, learned in the midst of their chemotherapy their health insurance was all in—finished, walked away. We change that in the Affordable Care Act. We eliminated the lifetime limits in health insurance policies for that very reason. We also said health insurance compa- nies should be entitled to a profit and, of course, should charge a premium to cover the cost of their administration of health care. But we started drawing limits on what they could ask. We said 85 percent of the money collected in premiums needed to be paid into actual health care, with the other 15 percent available for marketing, for adminis-tration, and for executive compensa-tion. Eighty-five percent had to go into the actual cost of health care, hoping to keep premiums from rising too fast. That was in the Affordable Care Act. When it came to coverage, we de- tected a problem: too many families had their sons and daughters grad-uating from college, looking for jobs, and not finding full-time jobs with health insurance. So we expanded fam-ily health care coverage to include children—young men and women— through the age of 25. We thought par-ents should be able to keep them under the family health care plan while they are getting their lives together and looking for work. That was one of the basics that was included in the Afford-able Care Act. All of those make health insurance more affordable and more reasonable for the families who need it. Then came the question of what to do about those people who have no health insurance. Some people don’t have health insurance because they work at a job that doesn’t provide it and they can’t afford it. Others have an oppor-tunity to pay for it but decide they are going to wait or that they don’t need it. We hear that particularly from younger people who think they are in-vincible and will never ever need health insurance coverage. So the ques-tion was how do we expand the reach of health insurance coverage. We did it in this bill. We set a standard and said people should not have to pay any more than 8 percent of their income for health in-surance premiums. If they are in lower income categories, we will help them with tax credits and treatment in the Tax Code to pay for their health insur-ance. For employers—the businesses people work for—they will be given ad-ditional tax credits to offer health in-surance, hoping to continue to expand that pool of insured people in America. For the poorest of the poor, we said, ul-timately, they would be covered by Medicaid—the government health in-surance plan—and for at least the first several years, the Federal Government will pay the entire cost, the expanded cost of that coverage. The notion is to get more and more people under the tent—under the um-brella of coverage. That not only gives them peace of mind, but it also means for many hospitals and providers across America there will be fewer charity patients. Let’s be honest about it. Even people without health insurance get sick. When they do, they come to a hospital and they are treated. When they can’t pay their bills, those bills are passed on to all the rest of us. In my hometown of Springfield, IL, at the Memorial Medical Center, the CEO there said: If we have everybody walking through our front door at least paying Medicaid, we will be fine. Do that, Senator. That is what this bill sets out to do. There were some people who objected to the part which said, if someone can afford to buy health insurance and doesn’t, they are going to pay a pen-alty. Some people called it a mandate. Others—myself included—called it per-sonal responsibility. If someone can af-ford to buy health insurance, they should buy it because 60 percent of the folks who don’t buy it end up getting sick and the rest of us pay for it. That is not fair to the system. It is esti-mated to cost those with private health insurance $1,000 a year just to pay for those who don’t buy it when they can. That was one of the issues being debated before the Supreme Court. So this bill, which ultimately passed, was signed by President Obama, has been debated back and forth ever since. It became a major topic in this year’s Presidential cam-paign. I don’t believe there was a single Republican Presidential candidate who didn’t get up and say: I will get rid of it on the first day I am in office. Gov-ernor Romney has said that. Yet when you look at all the provisions—the ex-pansion of coverage—even expanding Medicare’s prescription drug Part D for seniors—to think we would eliminate that, think about the hardship that would create across our country. We all waited expectantly for this day, this day at the end of the October term of 2011 for the U.S. Supreme Court, and the decision today was that the Affordable Care Act President Obama signed into law is constitu-tional. Now we can move forward. Some people have said: Is it perfect? The answer, of course, is no. I say half jokingly, the only perfect law was car-ried down the side of a mountain on clay tablets by ‘‘Senator Moses.’’ All the other efforts are our best human ef-forts and always subject to improve-ment. The same thing is true for this. I am sure the President would say ex-actly the same. The good news is that today, the Supreme Court found the President’s Affordable Care Act is con-stitutional. There was, of course, some question of one provision or another, but the bottom line is Chief Justice Roberts— not considered a liberal by any stand-ards—led the Court in a decision that found this law constitutional. The im-portant part of that is it means, for a lot of families, there is going to be help through this law. In Illinois last year, 1.3 million peo- ple on Medicare and 2.4 million people with private health insurance received preventive care at no cost. That is a provision in this law that was found constitutional today. That means that mammograms, cholesterol screenings, and other efforts ahead of time for pre-ventive care will help people prevent illness and save lives. Speaking of prevention, the law pro- vides help for States with their preven-tion programs—programs to help our children stay strong with immuniza-tions, programs that detect and pre-vent diabetes, heart disease, and ar-thritis. Another reason this law is so impor- tant is because of lifetime limits, as I mentioned. Before this law, insurance companies would literally say: Sorry, you hit your limit. We can’t pay for any more chemotherapy. But because the Affordable Care Act was found con-stitutional today by the Court, 4.6 mil-lion people in my State of Illinois alone received the care they needed last year without having to worry about an insurance company’s lifetime limits. It is prohibited by the Afford-able Care Act. In these tough economic times, as I mentioned, when young people are looking for work, the fact they can now have health insurance through their family’s plan up to the age of 26 is a sensible policy. Two-and-one-half million young Americans received pro-tection under the Affordable Care Act because of this single provision, and 102,000 of them live in my State of Illi-nois. Of course, the law, as I said, requires the insurance companies to spend more money of their premiums on actual medical care—85 percent, in fact. Over $61 million has been returned to those VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.017 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4698 June 28, 2012 with health insurance policies, and 300,000 people in Illinois are included, in the form of a rebate, because of the medical loss ratio. For seniors, it will be a helping hand to pay for prescription drugs. They are going to be able to help fill the so- called doughnut hole and have less money come out of their lifetime sav-ings to pay for the drugs they need to keep them strong and even alive. It also means preventive care for a lot of these seniors, so they are able to get the annual checkup in order to detect some problem before it gets serious. From the business side, the Afford- able Care Act—found constitutional today by the Supreme Court—is going to help small businesses pay for health insurance. The new tax provisions help them do the right thing and buy health insurance for their employees. So far, more than 228,000 businesses across America have taken advantage of this new tax credit and have saved $278 mil-lion. When this is all implemented—the Affordable Care Act—30 million more people will have health insurance across America. By 2019, 15 million of these will be in Medicaid and the rest will be in exchanges and in private health insurance. Another provision in here was impor- tant and that was the expansion of community health care clinics. Sen-ator B ERNIE SANDERS of Vermont, a good friend and a great leader on these issues, pushed hard for it. I have been to these community health care clinics across my State. They are wonderful primary care in the neighborhoods, in the small towns, in Springfield, and in Chicago, that truly help people along the way. Today, the President of the United States went to the cameras after the Supreme Court decision and talked about this decision by the Court and this law. He said for those who believe the Affordable Care Act was just poli-tics as usual, it was a political risk and he knew it. There were close friends and advisers of the President who basi-cally counseled him not to try and take this on. This issue has stopped President after President. I tried to help President Clinton and then-First Lady Clinton when they were attempting to get health care re-form passed. Try as they might, they couldn’t get it done. But President Obama stuck with it. Even though there was precious little help from the other side of the aisle, he stuck with it and got the bill passed. They then chal-lenged him in court at every level they could, and today—at the highest Court of our land—it was found constitu-tional. The President said—and I think we all should pay attention to this—it is not only good in its substance—and I have described that—but it is also a new challenge for us, Democrats and Republicans, to make it work. The American people want us to come to-gether to make health insurance af-fordable and available, to incentivize quality care, and to make certain America, the richest Nation on Earth, has the best and most affordable health care on Earth. It took the Supreme Court 193 pages to say it today, and now it is up to us, both Democrats and Republicans, to work together, maybe put the swords aside and sit down at a table and make this law even better across America. I think the American people are count-ing on us. The Supreme Court, in find-ing President Obama’s Affordable Care Act constitutional, made it clear that now it is up to us to put the policies in place that will make it successful and help families, businesses, and individ-uals all across America. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Texas. Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we have had a monumental decision from the Supreme Court of the United States, and I have to say I am dis-appointed, because while the opinion is not very clear, in many respects, the result is clear, and that is we are get-ting ready to see one of the largest tax increases in the history of our country. We are all talking about the fact the Supreme Court has declared the Obama health care plan constitutional, but let’s look at how it was declared con-stitutional. It was not based on the commerce powers of the Congress in the Constitution. It was based, instead, on taxing capabilities—the taxing power—of the Congress. I wish to read excerpts from an inter- view George Stephanopoulos did with President Obama. Under this mandate— Stephanopoulos says— the government is forcing people to spend money, fining you if you don’t. How is that not a tax? President Obama replies: No. That’s not true, George. For us to say that you’ve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase. Stephanopoulos goes on later to say: But you reject that it’s a tax increase? President Obama replies: I absolutely reject that notion. Yet the Court today said this is con- stitutional because of Congress’s power to tax. So we are going to see the tax increase go forward, and the small businesses and businesses that are looking at this, the individuals, are going to have a whopping increase in the cost of doing business at a time when—I certainly don’t have to point out—we are in an economic downturn, when the private sector is not hiring, when we have an over 8-percent unem-ployment rate. Yet now we see more costs on top of what we already have in this country. I don’t think that is the recipe for getting this country going again and hiring people to work. I would like to read a few quotes from employers on the impact of the Obama health care plan on their busi- nesses. Scott Womack, the president and owner of Womack Restaurants, is an IHOP franchisee. He said: Let me state bluntly. This law will cost my company more than we make. Grady Payne, who is the CEO of Con- nor Industries, said—it is very inter-esting because Conner Industries is headquartered in my home State of Texas: Conner Industries is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas with plants in 8 different states. Conner Industries started in 1981 with five people and one location. Today they have grown to 450 employees and eleven plant locations. They offer health coverage to their employees and the company pays over half of the total premium cost. In 2014, the company will have to choose how to comply with the law, either buy a more ex-pensive, government-approved healthcare benefit or drop health coverage completely and pay the $2,000 fine for each of their em-ployees. Thus, Mr. Payne has stated that the impact of this law will cost them over $1,000,000 no matter what option they choose. The chairman and CEO of NuVasive, a medical device company in San Diego, in an op-ed said: Provisions of the Affordable Health Care Act are destroying jobs, hindering innova-tion and slowing the economic recovery. To offset the medical device tax increase, we will be forced to reduce investments in re-search and development and cut up to 200 planned new jobs next year. So what we have seen today is a vali- dation of what many of us were con-cerned about when this law was going through Congress; that is, the enor-mous increase in the tax, the fine, and the overall burden to the businesses of this country which would do several things that are not good for the people of our country: It will increase costs to American consumers; it will inject the government into doctor-patient rela-tionships; it will most certainly add new burdens on business in an environ-ment in which we have over 8 percent unemployment. I also think it is very clear that though the President prom-ised that people will be able to keep their health care coverage as they know it, that health care coverage is not going to be there because so many companies are going to drop the health care coverage they have been offering because it is too expensive to comply with the government conscription of the plan that is required in order to avoid the $2,000 fine. I think what the Court said is in- sightful in this respect; and that is, while they said this law is constitu-tional based on the taxing power of Congress, they are not ruling on the wisdom nor the fairness of the policy. I think it is going to come down to the people of our country because the elec-tion this year is going to determine the ultimate fate of this bill. The Repub-lican nominee, Gov. Mitt Romney, has said very clearly, on the first day he is sworn into office he will ask for the re-peal of this health care law. I think it will become an issue in every contested congressional race and VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.021 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4699 June 28, 2012 every Senate race: Are you going to vote to keep this law that has been ruled constitutional based on the fact that it is a taxing power of Congress? The people will be able to decide if they want this jolt on their health care, if they want the extra cost, if they want the intrusion on the patient- doctor relationship, and if they want to possibly lose the coverage they have and be taxed to go into another plan— a government plan. We are going to see the erosion of the quality of health care in this country if we are not able to repeal this law and start all over. Now, I will say the purpose of passing health care reform is to provide more options for people to get affordable health care coverage. I think that is a worthy goal. I think we should go for that goal in a way that does not burden the economy of our country, stop em-ployers from employing people; in a way that preserves the doctor-patient relationship and doesn’t intrude on the people who do have coverage they want to keep. That should be our goal. There are several months before the election. I hope we will be able to do something in this Congress to start a new process of providing affordable health care options for the people of our country and not continue on this path of enormous tax increases—which have been validated by the Court—as well as an intrusion on the quality of our health care, and not something that in the bigger picture is going to keep our businesses from hiring more people to get the economy jump-start-ed, which should be every one of our goals. I hope we can work on this in a pro- ductive way before the election, but I also hope the people will make the final decision in the election if Con-gress has not acted before; that we will have a decisive election that will say we can do better. We, the people of the strongest country on Earth, can do bet-ter than a health care system that will be eventually turned over to the gov-ernment if we go down this path. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S ANDERS ). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. FLOOD INSURANCE Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, there are so many important issues in Wash-ington today, it is hard to know what to speak on first. But I am going to take this opportunity to talk about flood insurance. One of the reasons is because there are three States in the Union that carry the most policies rel- ative to our population, and it may be the most policies regardless of our pop-ulation. That would be Florida, No. 1; Texas, No. 2; Louisiana, No. 3; and, of course, California, No. 4. So while this bill affects everyone in the country, the four States that it af-fects the most and by far are the four States that I mentioned, and Louisiana happens to be one. So the people of my State pay a lot of attention to flood in-surance. We always have, and we al-ways will have to. I am sorry to say that just within the last few hours, with so much changing around here at the last minute, I was just given the information that the flood insurance bill—which we have not even debated on the floor of the Sen-ate—is now going to be put into an om-nibus package which includes many other important bills: the Transpor-tation bill, the RESTORE Act—which is also important for the gulf coast, parts of it that were accepted by the House, and there were a few important parts that were, unfortunately, left on the cutting room floor over in the House—and now the flood insurance bill. I want to make it clear that if I were called on to vote on the flood insurance bill that is now going to be a part of this package, I would vote no because there are some very important provi-sions that I was going to offer as amendments to the bill that I think are crucial to not just my State but to the State of Florida, potentially to the State of California, and potentially to Texas as well. I am not sure their Sen-ators are in complete agreement or un-derstand some of the challenges, but I want to point out a few of them. Unfor-tunately, I am not going to get a chance to vote no because I am going to have to vote for the whole package, which I intend to do, although this flood insurance bill is not in the posi-tion I would support. Let me give three reasons. No. 1, there is a provision of the bill that talks about V-Zones; that is, ve-locity zones. Right now, with FEMA, FEMA basically says if you are in a ve-locity zone, you cannot rebuild. I have St. Bernard Parish, Plaquemines Parish, Lafourche Parish, Terrebonne Parish, Cameron Parish, and large sections of St. Tammany and St. John the Baptist and Orleans Par-ish that you can see are designated V- Zones. This means likely to be flooded, not just based on their elevation but the way that the historical patterns of storms coming out of the gulf affect them. I understand that we have to be very careful in these areas so I had an amendment to say: No, you can rebuild but you have to rebuild up to the right elevation or you have to rebuild ac-cording to the highest standards. If we do not fix this, and this bill passes— which it looks as though it will—there will be great concerns or questions, if not a downright prohibition, on build-ing in these areas regardless of whether you pay for insurance. This is not right. The other amendment I was prepared to offer is an affordability amendment. People may not realize this—I hope Members will be listening. Again, this bill affects all the States, but in the underlying bill there is a provision that allows these rates for everyone in the country to be increased by 15 per-cent a year. People are struggling to pay flood in- surance now. I think that is very steep. People who are arguing for the 15-per-cent a year increase say it is important to get this program actuarially sound, it is currently running a $20 billion def-icit. I am well aware of the need to get this program in line. But I was going to offer an amendment that simply cre-ated and expanded a short, small, but important affordability provision of $10 million that the Department would have to help people on fixed incomes or lower or middle-income families who of course are working along the gulf coast and in some of these coastal areas. They are not sunbathing, not vaca-tioning. This is not about second homes. This is about primary homes. They have a right to live and have been living for generations near the coast. These are fisherman, et cetera. That was an affordability amendment that I cannot offer or file for the R ECORD . This is a very important issue. Flood insurance is not just about business and commerce; it is about culture; it is about a way of life; it is about pre-serving coastal communities; it is about being resilient in storms. Yes, Louisiana wants to pay its fair share. Florida must pay its fair share. Texas must pay its fair share. We have no problem with that. We have been for years. Some Members are now waking up and saying: Oh, my goodness, now you are telling us, people in other parts of the country, we have to buy flood in-surance? But we have a levee. You are telling us we have to buy flood insur-ance? Yes. We had levees in Louisiana for 200 years. Unfortunately, they break. Sometimes when the Federal Govern-ment doesn’t build them correctly, they disintegrate and our people get flooded. Yes, we have levees, we pay to build the levees, and we pay for insur-ance, and we are still not as protected as we could be. Again, we are not sun-bathing down here on this coast. We are producing oil and gas for the Na-tion. We are running the largest port system in North America, and we drain 40 percent of the continent. Florida has a little different situa- tion. They do a great deal of tourism and they do a great deal of sunbathing and other things. I am happy for Flor-ida and their economy. But the people I represent are not running huge vaca-tion operations. This is not an optional place for us to live. It is not optional for us, it is not optional for the Nation, and it is not optional for the world. We have to find an affordable and safe way to live here. I had an amendment to try to make this more affordable. That amendment is not going to be offered. The only positive thing I can say about the bill— VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:17 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.023 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4700 June 28, 2012 and there are some positive things, and this is important, I know, to the real-tors. I support them almost 100 per-cent—and the homebuilders. I have a very good record with the realtors and homebuilders. I believe in what they do and they are right when they say: We have to have a permanent extension be-cause we cannot close deals. People cannot sell their homes. We have to have this insurance program. And they are correct. Like a lot of things up here, it is a balance. With the amendments I was going to put on the bill and actually had worked out to do so, on balance the bill would have been better. I was prepared to vote for it on the floor. Now that it is being stuck into this package without the debate on the floor and without the amendments, I must go on record to say that I would vote against the bill in its current form, even though I know we need long-term flood insurance. Because of the increased rates, the lack of the af-fordability, and the lack of a fix to the V-Zones, I think it tips the balance against the bill generally. There is nothing I can do about it. That is the way it is going to happen. But I wanted to submit my comments for the R ECORD . I can promise the Members of this Senate after this bill goes into effect you are going to hear a lot of complaints from your constitu-ents. I am certain we will be back here within the year, after the elections— regardless of who wins and who loses— fixing some provisions that should have been fixed, but because there is not going to be a debate on the Senate floor will not be. I know this bill came out of the Banking Committee in the Senate with bipartisan support. I am well aware of that. But I think there were some cor-rections or some perfections that could have been done on the Senate floor. We are not going to have that opportunity. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded and that I be recognized to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as we know, the Supreme Court ruled on the health care law, and we have had a lot of phone calls and e-mails. People want to know what this means above the politics. Sometimes I think that in Washington everything is analyzed over what this means for the elections and what this means to the Repub-licans or the Democrats. What I hope to do today by coming to the floor of the Senate is to respond to some of my constituents from Florida, and folks around the country who have called as well, to show what this means in real life and what my position is toward this moving forward. So that is what I hope to do here today in the few min-utes I have while the Senate waits on the pending matter. Let’s begin by understanding what has happened today. The Supreme Court doesn’t decide whether some-thing is a good idea or a bad idea; the Supreme Court’s job is to decide whether something is constitutional. Today, by a vote of 5 to 4—four of the Justices disagreed, but five of the Jus-tices, including the Chief Justice, de-cided that a key component of the health care law that passed the year before I was elected was constitutional. They said it was constitutional because it was under the taxing powers of the Congress. In essence, they said that this mandate, this requirement is con-stitutional because it is a tax. That is curious, of course, because the President denied that it was a tax. I looked it up. I remember a specific interview the President gave while this was debated where he was asked by George Stephanopoulos on ABC: Is this a tax? He denied it. He denied it and said there was no way this was a tax. If I could find the right quote in here just to make sure I am not misquoting any-body in this day and age of fact-check-ing, the President specifically said that the notion that it was a tax was wrong. However, months later, when this ap-peared before the Supreme Court of the United States, his lawyers argued that, no, this is constitutional because this falls within the power of the govern-ment to tax. So that is important be-cause that is the reason this law still stands on the books today. Let’s remind ourselves of what a mandate is. This is not a mandate that the government provide an individual with insurance, this is a mandate that a person find insurance for himself or herself. For a mandate to work—and anyone who has been for a mandate will admit this to you—the penalty for not buying insurance has to be severe enough so that the person will decide to buy the insurance; otherwise, people will just pay the fine and not get the insurance. So what does this mean in the real world? I found a blog post from 2009. The numbers may have changed a little bit, I am not 100 percent sure, but this is from when the House was delib-erating at the time. An economist took this up on July 14, 2009, and he actually used a couple of real-world examples. This may be very similar to you, so lis-ten carefully. The first example he used is of a gen- tleman who is single and earns about $50,000 a year, which is four times the Federal poverty level, so he wouldn’t qualify for the subsidies under the bill. Now, he is a single 50-year-old non-smoker, small business employee. That means he works for a small business that doesn’t provide health insurance and isn’t required to because the law requires businesses that have more than 50 employees to provide insur-ance. If he works at a place that has five employees, they are not required to offer health insurance. So to reit-erate, he is 50 years old, works at a small business that is not required to offer insurance, and makes $50,000 be-fore taxes. He doesn’t have insurance. Now, he cannot afford a bare-bones pol-icy. This economist went through ehealthinsurance.com and found that the cheapest policy he could find was $1,600 a year. Depending on where you live in the country, when they start taking out taxes, $50,000 doesn’t add up to a lot of money. This is middle class. He can’t afford a $1,600-a-year policy, so instead he would have to pay a $1,150 fine, which is a tax. That is what he would have to pay. Guess what. Even after paying the $1,150, he still doesn’t have insurance. This is the real-world impact of the mandate. Here is another example. This one ac- tually uses my home State, so I picked this one. A married couple with two kids has a small business. They run a small tourist shop in Orlando, FL. I am not sure if these are real people or if it is hypothetical, but I like the fact that they picked Orlando, FL. The husband and wife make $90,000 a year at their small business. That is what the busi-ness makes, again, before taxes. They have a small business making $90,000. Between all the expenses they have and all the other tax components that come up, it is middle class. This is mid-dle class, OK? These are two employ-ees, but their wages exceed the amount to qualify for the small business tax credit. Because their business is so small, there will be no financial pen-alty for a business that only has two employees, but as individuals they still have to buy health insurance for them-selves and for their children. So here they are, husband and wife, 40 years old, two kids, they own a small tourist shop, and they are the only employees, making $90,000 a year together. The cheapest insurance they can get is a high-deductible plan with about a $6,000-a-year annual deductible. It costs them about $3,800 a year. The fine is $2,000 a year. So that is probably what they end up having to do now. This is a $2,000 increase in their taxes through a fine, and they still don’t have insurance to show for it. This is the third example I want to give, and this is not part of the anal-ysis. I pointed out that the law now re-quires any business with more than 50 full-time employees to offer health in-surance. Now, offering health insur-ance is a good thing. We should try to encourage that and provide opportuni-ties for businesses to do it. Imagine you are one of these businesses and you are asking yourself if you should hire the 51st or 55th employee. Should I grow my business? Well, as a result of this new mandate, maybe you decide not to now. How much will this cost us? It is $2,000 per employee if they don’t comply. How much will this cost us? Maybe this is not the year to add a few jobs. Even worse, maybe they should become a part-time business.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4701 June 28, 2012 I heard a lot about this in my cam- paign from franchises. Taco Bell and McDonald’s are not owned by Taco Bell or McDonald’s, they are owned by a small business owner. They are going to decide to make everyone part time because they can’t afford to pay the fine. They can’t afford to pay for the insurance. This would be a bad idea no matter what the economy is because now we are discouraging them from growing their businesses. No matter what the economy looked like, this would be a bad idea. Let me explain why it is worse. No. 1, guess who gets to enforce all of this stuff. Guess whom they have to answer to. Guess who they have to prove they have insurance. Your neighborhood, friendly IRS. That is who is in charge of enforcing this. Millions of Ameri-cans now have an IRS problem because they don’t have health insurance. This idea that they don’t have health insurance—because if we read some of these statements and interviews that the President gave when he said it wasn’t a tax, it made it sound as though they don’t want to buy insur-ance and they want to use the money for something else because they are ir-responsible. They are not irresponsible. They can’t afford it. There is not a pri-vate market for them to buy insurance because they can only buy insurance from their States. If they live in Flor-ida and there is some company in Cali-fornia that wants to sell them insur-ance, too bad, they can’t buy it. That is ridiculous. That is what we should be changing here. These people are not doing it because they don’t want to be responsible. They can’t afford it. Their house is upside down. They are making half as much and working twice as long. Their kids want to go to college. Everything has gotten more expensive, including gas, milk, their water bill, and electricity bill. On top of that, we are going to hit them with this? We just got a report today that shows that the economy barely grew in the first 3 months of this year. It was less than 2 percent. Our economy is not growing. When it is not growing, the debt gets worse, the unemployment gets worse, everything gets worse. We should not be doing anything in Wash-ington that makes it harder for people to grow this economy. Why would we do something such as this to people? Why would we hit the owner of a tour-ist shop with a $2,000-a-year tax or else the IRS is going to chase him around? Why would we hit this guy who is 50 years old, trying to make a living in the world working for a small business, with a $1,000-a-year tax when we are trying to grow our economy? Health insurance is a real problem. It is. I wish more Americans could get their health insurance the way Con-gress gets it. We get it very simply. We get to choose, depending on which State we are from, between 8 to 10 com-panies, and we can decide. If we want a higher copayment, we pay less pre-mium and vice versa. We get to choose. Most Americans don’t have that choice. They get their insurance from their job and their job tells them: This is your insurance plan. Pick a plan out of this book. Those are the kinds of things we should be working on. So apart from everything else, this is a terrible idea because it hurts our ability to grow our economy. This is the real-life impact of this bill. This is the impact it is going to have, and we are going to see it. We are going to see it in a further downturn in our econ-omy and in slower economic growth. This is going to have a real impact. This is a big deal. People across this country and across Florida have every right and every reason to be worried about the impact this is going to have on them. This is a middle-class tax in-crease, and millions of Americans now have an IRS problem. People will now have to, for the first time in American history, prove they have health insur-ance or they are going to have to deal with the IRS. I guarantee that is not good for small business. I guarantee that is not good for the middle class. I guarantee that is not good for eco-nomic growth. That is where we are today. If there is anything I hope we can do—I wasn’t here when the health care bill passed, but I hope some of my colleagues who voted for this will think to themselves: This is not what we intended. We want to help people who are uninsured but not like this. This is never what we wanted to do. I hope enough reasonable minds will come together to either sus-pend or repeal this, and let’s start from scratch. Let’s come up with a real plan to help deal with the health insurance crisis in America. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Nebraska. Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, today marks one of the most historic and cer-tainly highly anticipated Supreme Court decisions in a long time. I would be less than candid if I didn’t say I am enormously disappointed that the Court upheld the law in its indi-vidual mandate which requires all Americans to purchase government-ap-proved insurance whether they choose to or don’t choose to. I believe it is fun-damentally wrong for the U.S. Govern-ment to intervene in the lives of Amer-icans in this very direct way. However, the Supreme Court’s role within our system of government is to interpret the Constitution, and they have spo-ken. So with the ruling now officially out, what is important is where we go from here. The Court did not decide that this law is good policy. In fact, Chief Jus-tice Roberts went out of his way to clarify this point. It is clear in my mind that we must do everything we can to repeal this flawed law because it is enormously bad policy. While we have waited over 2 years for the final decision about this law’s con-stitutionality, we haven’t had to wait that long to learn why the law is bad for America. The law was a train wreck from the very beginning: backroom deals, empty promises, political tactics that epitomize what disgusts Ameri-cans about their government. Some of the law’s leading supporters even ad-mitted they hadn’t read the 2,700-page bill. The Speaker acknowledged we are going to have to pass the law to see what is in it. My colleagues across the aisle hastily passed the bill on the no-tion that there were some gold nuggets in there, tucked inside the law, and that maybe Americans would think they were lucky enough to cash in. We have come to know nothing could be further from the truth. After more than 2 years, there has been a lot of rain but not a single rain-bow and certainly no pot of gold when it comes to this legislation. Instead, what we have seen is one broken prom-ise after another. Just last week, the administration’s own Medicare Actuary reported na-tional health care spending will in-crease at an average of more than 50 percent over the next decade. The same study estimated, in 2014, the increase in private health insurance premiums is expected to accelerate to 7.9 percent. But the startling fact is that is more than twice the increase Americans would have faced in the absence of the health care law. This is just one of many studies that indicate the law does not bend the cost curve down as the President promised. It begs the basic question: Why would Congress pass a massive overhaul of our country’s health care system that actually increases the cost of care? It is so ironic that the majority decided to call this health care law the Afford-able Care Act. One can hardly argue that more people will receive better care under a plan that drives costs up-ward as well as puts Medicare on an unsustainable path. The Medicare Actuary asserted in the most recent trustees report that the law could lead to significant access issues for beneficiaries under Medicare, and Medicare itself is estimated to be insolvent by 2024. Due to the cuts to Medicare and the health care law, he said: ‘‘The prices paid by Medicare for health services are very likely to fall increasingly short of the cost of pro-viding those services.’’ He goes on to say: ‘‘Severe problems with beneficiary access to care’’ will occur. That is just another way of saying, to put it very directly and simply, our seniors are going to find it harder and harder to find a doctor or a hospital that will accept them as patients. To put it simply, our seniors are going to have difficulty accessing medical care under this law. The health care law perpetuates the problems within this very difficult sys-tem. It is clear that heavy-handed gov-ernment solutions are not the answer, but that is exactly what this law cre-ates. In this law, there are 159 new VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.026 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4702 June 28, 2012 boards, over 13,000 pages of new regula- tions, and it gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services more than 1,700 new or expanded powers. No one will convince me this act isn’t a seizure of our government, of our health care system, and putting it under the power of government. Americans don’t want government bureaucrats diagnosing and prescribing their care. They want the freedom to choose an insurance plan that covers their needs and to simply see the doc-tor of their choice. It seems the President even manipu- lated this sentiment, which is why he said no fewer than 47 different times: ‘‘If you like your plan, you can keep it.’’ He knew that pledge would help him gain support for his law, but, sadly, the American public was misled and his promise can’t be kept. The nonpartisan Congressional Budg- et Office estimates up to 20 million Americans could lose the insurance they get through work—the insurance they like and want to keep—because of this health care law. Families in 17 States, including my own State of Ne-braska, no longer have access to child- only health insurance because of the mandates in this misguided legislation. That is not the only way the law will hurt hard-working American families. The Director of the CBO testified that the new law will mean 800,000 fewer jobs over the next decade. The American people deserve more than a laundry list of flawed policies and empty pledges. Americans deserve step-by-step reform instead of rushed policy; transparent reforms, not a 2,700-page entangled mess; and an open debate, not a closed-door discussion and the backroom deals that were so necessary to get this flawed piece of legislation passed. More than anything, they deserve sound policy that delivers on the promises. I will do everything I can to continue to push to repeal this misguided law and to push for policies that set us on the right course because the path we pave will define our future as a nation. There is no disputing that Medicare and Medicaid are two of the biggest drivers of our Nation’s $15 trillion debt. So if we want to secure a sound future for our children and our grandchildren, we have to fundamentally reform these government programs, not double down on policies that will bankrupt them. In that same vein, we can’t ignore our struggling economy. Instead, we need policies that promote business growth and job creation. I believe we can pass step-by-step reforms that confront these tough issues and policies that de-part from a top-down, one-size-fits-all approach. The issue of health care touches all of us at the deepest level. Whether it is a new life entering into our world, a tough diagnosis, a lifesaving surgery or care for a loved one in their final days, health care decisions should not be dic-tated by Washington. Families and the physician they trust need to be at the heart of the decisions that impact their health. The Supreme Court has spoken definitively about the constitu-tionality of this law, but Americans have spoken loudly and clearly when it comes to the sensibility of this process and of this policy. It is time to repeal it and put in place sensible reforms that truly do bring down costs. I yield the floor and I note the ab- sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. S HAHEEN ). The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the Supreme Court’s ruling this morning in the case involving the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act’s individual man-date. In that case, the Supreme Court rendered a decision that may be spun by many, perceived by many, as a vic-tory for the proponents of the con-troversial individual mandate con-tained within the Affordable Care Act. I would submit today, however, that this victory, if it is being called that, will prove to be not only hollow but also short lived. I say that because, sig-nificantly, the Supreme Court was able to uphold the constitutionality of the mandate only by a series of gymnastics that allowed the Court to find this was a tax. First, the Court addressed the issue and concluded, for only the third time in the last 75 years—only the third time since 1937—that Congress had, in fact, exceeded its power as asserted under the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution. Having concluded that Congress lacks the authority to compel com-merce, the creation of commerce so that it could then regulate commerce, the Supreme Court went on to shoe-horn this individual mandate provision into the Supreme Court’s conception of Congress’s taxing power. This awkward construction is one that exposes many of the true flaws of the individual man-date. The mandate itself, we must remem- ber, was not wildly popular among the American people at the time it was en-acted. It has become even less popular as the American people have come to understand it. A recent poll revealed that roughly 74 percent of Americans do not like the individual mandate. This is easy for us to understand when we think about the fact that we as Americans—we are born as a free peo-ple. We were intended to live as a free people. It offends our most basic sense of freedom to have one of the most per-sonal decisions made for us by govern-ment—particularly by the impersonal, distant government that is based in Washington, DC. These kinds of decisions should be made by the individuals and families in consultation with their doctors, not by government bureaucrats in Wash-ington, DC. So the fact that it is un-popular does not surprise us, and given the fact that the Supreme Court was able to uphold the individual mandate only by calling it a tax is very signifi-cant. It is especially significant given the fact that it was pitched to the American people as something other than a tax. The President promised us he would not raise our taxes. He promised us the individual mandate did not amount to a tax increase. He promised us all along that he would never raise the taxes of any American earning less than $250,000 a year. Well, those who participated in Congress who voted for this provision also promised us this would not amount to a tax increase. They did so for one simple reason: They knew it could not pass. They knew it would not be able to get the number of votes necessary to make it become law if they called it a tax. So they did not. They went to great lengths to make sure it was not de-scribed or characterized or structured as a tax within the text of the statute itself. Now, after the fact, the Supreme Court has taken the step of shoehorning this regulation into Congress’s taxing authority, and it is calling it a tax, effectively insulating those Members of Congress who voted for it from the political liability at-tached to having voted for a tax in-crease—not just any tax increase but a tax increase that the Joint Committee on Taxation has concluded will be borne overwhelmingly by hard-work-ing, middle-income earners. In fact, they have concluded that over 75 percent of the burden associ-ated with this mandate that has now been deemed a tax will be paid by those earning less than $250,000 a year. It was unpopular before we were told it would be deemed a tax. Now that it is a tax, we cannot expect that its status as a tax will enhance its popularity. If any-thing, we can expect that it will be-come even less popular with the Amer-ican people. For that reason, I am absolutely con- vinced that for those who call this a victory for the individual mandate, it will prove to be anything but a victory. It will prove to be something that will result in a groundswell of people con-tacting their Members of Congress, telling them they do not want their taxes raised, telling them that Mem-bers of Congress who voted for this promised them it would not be a tax in-crease, asking them, for instance, to vote on it, to decide once and for all whether they are willing now to call it a tax, given that was the only way in which it could be affirmed, upheld, as a valid constitutional exercise of Congress’s power. As we move forward to the November elections, we are going to hear a lot about what people do not want out of their national government.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4703 June 28, 2012 continue to hear a lot from those peo- ple who are offended by this notion that the government can tell them where to go to the doctor and how to pay for it, who are offended by the no-tion that government would step in and tell Americans: You have to buy health insurance, not just any health insurance but that health insurance which Congress, in its infinite wisdom, has deemed necessary for every Amer-ican to purchase. And if you do not, you are going to be penalized. If you do not, you are going to be taxed. People are going to be upset about this. They are going to complain to Congress and to candidates for Con-gress. They are going to complain to the President and to other candidates for the Presidency that this is not the kind of government they want. After they do that, they will proceed, and they will start talking about what kind of government they do want. That is where we have to move, away from the kind of government we do not want to-ward the kind of government we do want. The kind of government we do want today is, in so many respects, the same kind of government we as Americans have always wanted ever since our founding; that is, a government that at the national level recognizes limits to its power, recognizes that whenever government acts it does so at the ex-pense of our individual liberty. When the Federal Government acts, to a significant degree it does so at the expense of our State governments, gov-ernments which are closer to the peo-ple and often more responsive to the needs and to the evolving demands of the people. This is not simply a techni-cality upon which we are involved in a discussion. This is a very important part of the political process. It is essen-tial that any time we raise taxes, we do so in a way that is clear to the people and that we stand accountable to the people for raising taxes. The courts do not have the expertise to do that, and yet they exercised that power today. As the majority opinion today re- minded: The Supreme Court of the United States possesses neither the expertise nor the pre-rogative to make policy judgments. Those decisions are entrusted to our Nation’s elect-ed leaders who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them. This reminds me of one of my favor- ite quotes from our country’s greatest Founding Father, George Washington, who said something very similar way back in 1789, when he explained: The power under the Constitution will al- ways be in the people. It is entrusted for cer-tain defined purposes and for a limited pe-riod to the representatives of their own choosing. And whenever it is executed con-trary to their interests or not agreeable to their wishes, their servants can and undoubt-edly will be recalled. This reminds us of the fact that we as Americans are in control of our own destiny as a nation. We as Americans are here and have the prerogative to explain what we want and what we do not want out of our government. The government exists to serve the people and not the other way around. The de-cision rendered by the Supreme Court today, while I disagree with it in many respects, is one that I predict will usher in a new era of robust debate and discussion over issues of federalism and individual freedom. That debate, I am convinced, will lead inexorably to the result that we as Americans will be-come more free, less captive to a gov-ernment that tells us where to go to the doctor and how to pay for it, and that we as a people will again prosper as we regain our God-given right to constitutionally limited government. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Maryland. Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak on the Affordable Care Act. Today I am so relieved that the Supreme Court has upheld the Afford-able Care Act as constitutional. With this ruling, our Nation’s highest Court has made it clear that no matter who you are—a man or a woman, a senior facing cancer, a child with juvenile dia-betes—you will have health care that is available, reliable, and undeniable. Health care reform has achieved many goals that the American people wanted us to do: One, expanding uni-versal access. Now 32 million people will have health care they did not have before. Second, it breaks the strangle-hold of insurance companies, ending their punitive practices, particularly in those areas of preexisting conditions where they denied health care because a child might have autism or asthma or for women where they had a par-ticular approach where they charged us more than for men of comparable health status—30 percent more. Then they treated simply being a woman as a preexisting condition, or a preg-nancy, sometimes the need for a C sec-tion. In some States being a victim of domestic violence was considered a preexisting condition. We ended that practice. We also saved and strengthened Medicare, and we emphasized preven-tion, early detection, and screening. That will save lives, improve lives, and also save money. I am proud of what we did in Con- gress with the universal coverage. For the first time in our history we are committed to covering every single American with health care. It helps young families to be able to look out for their children. It helps young adults recently graduated from college, some looking for a job, some working in startups where there is no health in-surance. Because of health care reform, 52,000 young adults in Maryland will have coverage on their parents’ policies while they go back to school, look for a job, or get that entrepreneurial spirit going. Then there are these punitive prac- tices of the insurance companies. Much has been said about how we interfere with people’s right to see the doctor of their choice or get health care. That is what insurance companies have been doing for years. People in pinstripes sitting in boardrooms made decisions on who could get health care and who couldn’t. We stopped them from denying families health insur-ance. We stopped insurance companies from denying children’s coverage. Con-gress ended, as I said, discrimination against women. I remember when they tried to take our mammograms away, and I said no and organized the preventive health care amendment. We women fought to have access to mammograms and other things related to our particular life needs. The fact is we wanted it for the men too. We organized for the preven-tion amendment so we could limit the need of copays for this, so we women could have access to mammograms, so men could have access to screening for prostate cancer, so all Americans could get that screening for the dread ‘‘C’’ word, such as colon cancer, and how about diabetes and heart disease. These are the kinds of things that, if we can have early detection and early screen-ing, will save lives, stop the spread of the disease or keep it from getting worse. Diabetes, undetected, uncontrolled, and unmanaged, can result in the loss of an eye, a kidney or a leg, all because one has lost their health insurance. Be-cause of what we have done in the Af-fordable Care Act, not only will people have health care, but they will have the preventive services where, early on, they will be able to examine exactly where they are and have access to a di-abetic educator and have the moni-toring and coaching they need and, hopefully, the diabetes comes under control and the health care costs come under control. That is what we did in this bill, and I am very proud of it. I travel my State a lot. As I went from diner to diner out there in the communities, where I could talk to the people unfettered, unchoreographed, they said to me: B ARB, I not only worry about losing my job, but I worry about losing my health insurance. I don’t know what will happen to my family. I fear that I am one health care catas-trophe away from family bankruptcy. I want to make sure my family is taken care of. I talk to small businesses. How can they afford that? They need predict-ability and understanding and they need access to something called the health care exchange, where it will be akin to an economic mall, where they will be able to go to the health ex-change and see the whole lineup of pri-vate health insurance companies and the benefits they offer. Small busi-nesses will be able to navigate that and see what they need and what they can afford for the benefit of their workers. This is the American way. This does use market techniques, but at the same time we don’t use the free market to endanger the people in terms of uni-versal access and some of these others.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4704 June 28, 2012 There are many things in this bill. One of the other things I like so much was that we insist that 80 percent of the premium we pay goes into health care, not into the executives’ pockets for perks, privileges or profits. I believe in the free enterprise sys- tem, and I believe in profit, but I don’t believe in profiteering. So we said 20 percent goes into administrative costs, and if they can control those, they will make a bigger profit. But 80 percent has to actually go to rewarding pro-viders for the health care they do, for their education and training. I think it is terrific. Part of the bill has already kicked in. My constituents in Maryland will see over $5 million returned to them be-cause we insisted on this provision. We are for providers getting what they need in terms of reimbursement but at the same time looking at and making sure it goes into the health care they need. Today we have had the ruling of the Supreme Court. I was out there on the steps of the Supreme Court, and I loved every minute of it. As you know, I got into politics as a neighborhood pro-tester. I fought a highway and the downtown establishment and I fought the political bosses. When I talk to young people around the world—par-ticularly those with aspirations in autocratic or dictatorial environ-ments—I tell them that in America when you are a protester, they don’t put you in jail, they send you to the Senate. I am here because of the first amendment of the Constitution—free speech, freedom of assembly. When I was out there on the steps today and heard the roar of the crowd, whether it was the tea party who had access to a microphone or whether it was me who had access to a micro-phone, I knew the Founders’ vision of America had worked. They believed in limited government. They believed in checks and balances. No President should have unlimited power. No Con-gress should have unbridled power, and the Supreme Court would be an inde-pendent judiciary to act as referee. President Obama proposed a bill. We duked it out in the Congress and we passed it and sent it out into the land. There have been legal challenges. It went to the Supreme Court, and the Court looked at the bill not for utility or even desirability, they looked at it for constitutionality. Today, they ruled that the bill was constitutional. I am sure somewhere there is Tom Jefferson, John Adams, and his wife Abigail, who said they lived the Con-stitution, and in that health care bill, by the way, John, they didn’t forget the ladies. I yield the floor and suggest the ab- sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous con- sent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to comment on the Su-preme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act. This was a good day for the American people. It allows us to move forward with providing universal health care coverage for all Ameri-cans—affordable, quality health care. I wish to quote from a former Mem- ber of this body when he said: For me, this is a season of hope, new hope for a justice and fair prosperity for the many and not just for a few, new hope. And this is the cause of my life, new hope that will break the old gridlock and guarantee that every American—north, south, east, west, young, old—will have decent, quality health care as a fundamental right and not a privi-lege. That was a statement from our former colleague, the late Senator Ted Kennedy, on August 26, 2008. This Con-gress acted and did what was right to move this Nation forward to join all the other industrial nations in the world to say health care is a right, not a privilege. The Supreme Court today recognized it was Congress’s responsibility, and Congress had the legal authority to move forward. As a result of this deci-sion, we are going to find that $10.7 bil-lion has been recovered already today by dealing with waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare system. We will be able to continue with those programs that make our health care system more af-fordable. We will be able to continue health care coverage for those between the ages of 19 and 25 who are now on their parents’ health insurance policy; 3.1 million young adults have benefited from that provision of the Affordable Care Act that was upheld by the Su-preme Court today. Seventeen million children with pre- existing conditions can no longer be de-nied coverage by their insurers. That provision is now safe as a result of the Supreme Court decision. And 5.3 mil-lion Americans on Medicare have saved, on average, $600 on their pre-scription drugs. As you know, we worked in this Af- fordable Care Act to close the coverage gap—the so-called doughnut hole—on prescription drug coverage for our sen-iors. In upholding the Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court allows us to continue to make sure that coverage gap is eliminated. There are 70,000 Americans with pre- existing conditions who now have the security to know their coverage is safe. In addition, in 2011, 32.5 million seniors received one or more free preventive services. So far in 2012, 14 million sen-iors have already received these serv-ices. The expansion of benefits in Medi- care that was under the Affordable Care Act, providing the wellness exam and eliminating the copayments on preventive health services, will also now be saved and our seniors will be able to continue to receive those bene-fits. On the doughnut hole, the coverage gap on prescription drugs will save $3.7 billion for 5.2 million seniors, with an average of $651. This is real money. This is the difference between some seniors being able to take their medi-cines or having to leave them on the pharmacist’s desk. That is now also protected. Insurance companies will provide al- most 13 million Americans with over $1 billion in rebates in 2012. We put into the health reform proposals protec-tions against excessive premiums by private insurance companies. Well, that is going to save consumers in America over $1 billion. And 105 mil-lion Americans will no longer have life-time limits on their coverage. Insurance should be there to protect you. Before the Affordable Care Act, there were limits that might not have covered extraordinary costs, cata-strophic costs. We now have that pro-tection as a result of the Affordable Care Act and the Supreme Court’s up-holding that decision today. It is also important for small busi- nesses. In 2011, 360,000 small businesses took advantage of the tax credit that helps small companies afford to buy health insurance for their employees. When we fully implement this bill in 2014, small companies will enjoy the same larger pools and lower premiums that larger companies enjoy today in covering around 2 million workers. So we have already made a significant amount of progress as a result of the Affordable Care Act and the Supreme Court upholding that law today. I wish to talk a minute about the Pa- tients Bill of Rights. One of the major parts of the bill was to take on the abusive practices of private insurance companies. We all know that was at risk if the Supreme Court did not up-hold the actions of Congress. As a re-sult of upholding the actions of Con-gress, we now find, for example, access to emergency care, a provision I worked on, says it is prudent for you to go to an emergency room if you are having shortness of breath, if you are having chest pains. It is the right thing to do to go to the emergency room and that your insurance company has to pay for that visit. It can’t go by your final diagnosis that it may not be a heart attack. After you get your bill, and it is not paid for by your insurance company—you might have a heart at-tack—this bill protects a person and makes sure insurance companies do not use abusive practices against you. Access to women’s health care is guaranteed under the Patients Bill of Rights. Access to pediatric care and choice of health care professional as your primary care—all that is in what we call the Patients Bill of Rights that protects you against abusive practices of private insurance companies. Clinical trial coverage is also here, and the provision I worked on, health VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.036 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4705 June 28, 2012 disparities. We know we pay a heavy cost in America because of health dis-parities in minority populations and in gender issues. We now have a National Institute for Minority Health and Health Disparities at the National In-stitutes of Health. That will help us understand why we have these dispari-ties in our system and what we can do to reduce those disparities, because it is the right policy for America and it will also save us money. That law now is protected. That institute is pro-tected and is no longer in jeopardy as a result of the Supreme Court’s uphold-ing of the Affordable Care Act. Let me talk about oral health care. We have talked frequently on the floor here about Deamonte Driver, the 12- year-old in Maryland who, in 2007, had no health insurance and could not get access to dental care and lost his life. We said that was not going to happen again in our State, or anyplace in the Nation, and we are proud that chil-dren’s access to pediatric health care— dental care—is protected under the es-sential benefit provisions in the Afford-able Care Act that was upheld by the Supreme Court today. I also want to comment on the im- portance of the legal decision beyond health care. To me, it shows the Su-preme Court was able to find a way to advance the rule of law and to follow precedent we have seen in upholding programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which are mandatory insur-ance programs. It is the right decision on the rule of law. It is the right legacy for this Court to find a way—in a Su-preme Court that has nine different Justices with different views—to come together on an opinion that upheld the authority of Congress to act on a major national problem. Now it is time for us to move for- ward. This issue has been litigated. The Supreme Court is the final arbiter of this decision. It is constitutional. I urge my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to work together to implement this bill in the best manner for the people of this Nation. We know we are saving money, we know the Congressional Budget Office says the implementation of the Affordable Care Act will save hundreds of billions of dollars over the first 10 years and then trillions of dollars beyond that in our health care system. Let’s work to-gether to make sure it works. Let’s work together in the interest of the American people. Let’s put our par-tisan fights aside, let’s accept what the Supreme Court has done, and let’s move forward to get this law imple-mented in the most cost-effective way so we can indeed achieve the goal Sen-ator Kennedy was talking about—that every American should have access to affordable quality care in the richest Nation in the world. With that, Madam President, I sug- gest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam Presi- dent, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam Presi- dent, today, June 28, 2012, 30 million American people gave thanks, and it is because the Supreme Court this morn-ing upheld the health care law that will provide those 30 million people with access to affordable health insur-ance. Today is a proud day for America and for the values we cherish because on this day our Nation’s highest Court has reaffirmed that America is a country that works for everybody, not just a privileged few. We fought for these val-ues for many years, and this victory is just the latest in America’s long strug-gle for a fairer and more equal country. We took the first step 77 years ago when President Franklin Roosevelt signed Social Security into law, ensur-ing that in this country no senior would go hungry. Thirty years later President Lyndon Johnson helped America take the next step when he created Medicare and Medicaid, ensur-ing that our seniors and the most vul-nerable among us would always have access to health care. And today our ef-forts to ensure that every American has access to quality health care has been given the stamp of approval by our Supreme Court. Today we estab-lished our belief in America, the wealthiest Nation on Earth, that it is our moral duty to make sure everyone can keep themselves and their families healthy. A little more than 2 years ago, we heard the call of Americans struggling to pay for health care—parents who had to choose between keeping their children healthy and putting food on the table and seniors who couldn’t af-ford lifesaving medication. So we passed and President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, and already millions of Americans are reaping the benefits of this law. Thanks to health reform, insurers can no longer deny people coverage for a preexisting condition. If someone has cancer or some other longtime sick-ness, insurers can’t deny them cov-erage if they are already sick from these conditions. Up to 17 million chil-dren with preexisting conditions are al-ready benefiting from this provision. Under the Affordable Care Act, insur-ance companies are prohibited from canceling coverage when people are sick. And more than 3 million people in my State of New Jersey no longer have a lifetime limit on their health insur-ance coverage. Today millions of seniors are already receiving free preventive health serv-ices and are saving an average of $600 a year on prescription drugs. And it is not just seniors who are seeing lower costs; almost 2 million New Jerseyans with private insurance now receive pre-ventive health service at no additional cost. For women, these services include cancer screenings, such as Pap smears and mammograms. Since the 1950s, cer-vical cancer screenings have cut mor-tality rates by more than 70 percent. Think about that—70 percent of the people are alive now who otherwise would have died if they didn’t have the coverage. Young people have benefited as well. More than 73,000 young adults in New Jersey obtained health coverage last year through their parents’ insurance plans. This has brought their parents peace of mind, knowing that their chil-dren, who may have just graduated from school and are making their way in the world, will be covered with in-surance if they need it. But even with the Supreme Court’s decision, our friends the Republicans continue to fight our efforts. They are again showing they will stop at noth-ing to make seniors have to pay more for medications, more families going bankrupt, and more parents having to choose between feeding their children and taking them to the doctor. Our colleagues across the aisle keep telling us that they want to repeal and replace health reform, that they sim-ply favor other solutions, but they have no proposals and no ideas on how to do that. Instead, they just keep giv-ing the American people the same mes-sage: Give your benefits back; we can’t afford it—in this rich Nation of ours. Well, I have a message for my friends here in this place where care is so care-fully given: If you don’t want Ameri-cans, I say to colleagues here, to have affordable health coverage, then you ought to give yours back. That is what I say. The Republican hypocrisy is stunning. As Members of Congress, politicians have access—all of us—to world-class health care, but they are determined to take away the lifeline that health reform law offers to fami-lies who really need it. Let’s be clear. Without this law, in- surers could once again restrict bene-fits, cancel coverage when people get sick, and refuse care to people with preexisting conditions. The Repub-licans want to return to the days when it was legal for insurers to turn away sick children, to say: Sorry, you are not covered by insurance. No matter how sick you are, we can’t give you any help. And I say to my Republican col- leagues, stop attacking the American health care plan, not the Obama health care plan. Start working with us to en-sure a healthy and happy future for all of our children and grandchildren. Americans don’t want to relive the health care debates with the lies about death panels and socialized medicine. The American people want us to move forward and work together to lower costs and make sure no American gets left behind. That is what the American people deserve from us. They send us to this place for 6 years at a time. That is the America we must believe in. That is the America we fight for. And today we are one step closer to making that America a reality.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4706 June 28, 2012 I speak for myself. Some years ago, I was 18 years old and I signed up to serve my country in World War II. It was a dark moment in our history. The war was at its height. My father was on his deathbed. He was just past 42 years of age. He had cancer, acquired—like his brother and his father did—from work in the mills of Paterson, NJ. That is what they had. My mother was a 37- year-old widow. Things were tough. Things were difficult. I had a little sis-ter. My father died, and we all grieved. I was already enlisted in the Army, and they permitted me to stay home until my father passed on. But what hap-pened is not only did my father leave grief, but he left bills—bills for hos-pitals, for pharmacists, for doctors. People shouldn’t have to go through that. The coverage ought to be there that says: We will take care of you. You are an American citizen. Be proud of that. And don’t let anybody fight to take away your rights to protect their rights. No, that is not a balance. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. B LUMENTHAL ). The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRAHAM. I ask consent to be recognized for 5 minutes to speak about the Supreme Court’s ruling. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, there are a couple observations I would like to make about the historic ruling by the Supreme Court today. No. 1 is about the legislative process. Members of Congress during the debate on Obama health care had a very pas-sionate, heated debate which is part of democracy. As I recall the debate, when people on our side suggested this is a tax increase, that all the fines and costs associated with the health care bill would be a massive tax increase, our friends on the other side, almost to a person, said: No, this is not a tax in-crease. President Obama assured the American people during the debate that the fine is not a tax. I think the reason that was so is be- cause if we debated this bill and the only way we could pass the bill is using the power of Congress to tax under the Constitution, there would not have been 10 votes for the legislation. No-body would have wanted to go home and say I just increased your taxes by billions of dollars over the next 10 years to fix health care, because I think most Americans believe our health care in this country needs to be reformed, and it is in many ways bro-ken and needs to be fixed, but there are very few people in this country who be-lieve we don’t tax enough and that is the problem with health care. That is not the problem. The problem with health care is not the lack of how much we tax, it is the lack of choices people have and the competition when it comes to purchasing health care. Many of us want to give people a chance to buy health care outside of the State in which they live, which they cannot do today. Many of us be-lieve some form of medical malpractice reform will lower costs. Many of us are for preventing preexisting illnesses being used to deny health care. I would like to give individuals the same tax writeoffs as businesses have when it comes to purchasing health care, and I am willing to help those who do not have the money to buy health care to be able to purchase health care in the private sector. I am willing to do a lot of things, but I am not willing to impose a massive tax increase to fix health care. Also, I do not think it is fair for people in the body, during the debate on a bill, to say: This is not a tax increase, vote for the bill, and wind up having to be told by the Court the only way this is legal is for it to be a tax increase. Here is my challenge to every Mem- ber of the Democratic Party who said this was not a tax increase when we de-bated the bill. I am asking now, if they did not want to increase taxes to fix health care, repeal this bill and work with me and others to find a way to fix health care without a massive tax in-crease. If after the Supreme Court rul-ing they are still OK with the legisla-tion, be honest enough to go back home and say: I raised your taxes to fix health care because I thought that was the right thing to do. Then let’s have a debate about whether that is the right thing to do. I can promise, it is not the right thing to have a debate where the President of the United States and the architects of the bill assure everyone they are not having a tax increase when, in fact, that is the only way this bill can stand. I believe we all owe it to the Amer- ican people to be on record. If after to-day’s ruling Senators are still for this legislation, have the courage to tell the American people: I am for it, even though I had to raise your taxes to make it happen. Stand behind what they believe. If someone believed at the time this should not be considered a tax increase and they are upset or they are worried that it is now being called a tax increase and they think that is wrong, have the courage to say let’s start over. Nobody is going to hold it against a political leader who is willing to change their mind if it makes sense. I cannot think of a better oppor- tunity for Congress to revisit an issue than this. If there is ever a bill that needed to be revisited it is the Obama health care bill. It needs to be revisited and it needs to start over because it was passed on a party-line vote. It was passed with statements being made that this is not a tax increase when it turned out to be. I hope we have the wisdom and the courage to start over and sort of get this thing right. The second point I would like to make is that no one in this country has suggested that health care needs to be fixed through a massive tax increase. Let’s find a better model to fix health care than hundreds of billions of dol-lars of new taxes. A final thought is, how do we move forward? In November of 2012, every person who voted for Obama health care told their constituents this is not a tax. They owe it to their constituents to go back and say: Listen, the Su-preme Court said this can only stand with it being a tax. I am either OK with that or I would like a second chance to fix it. President Obama is a good man and sincerely believes that health care needs to be reformed in a certain way. I agree it needs to be reformed but not in this way. The President owes it to the American people to correct his statement when he assured us all this was not a tax increase. Many Ameri-cans found comfort in that. I have al-ways believed the Court could uphold this law under one theory and one the-ory only. I never believed the com-merce clause was so broad that we in Congress could compel someone to buy a product they did not want. The Court said today that the commerce clause cannot be used in such a fashion. The bill was sold as a power within the commerce clause. The Court said today the commerce clause will not allow Congress to make the public buy a product. That is not commerce. That should make all of us feel better that there are some limits on the commerce clause vis-a-vis our Congress. But the Court did say when it comes to the power of a tax to tax, the Congress’s discretion is broad. That is constitu-tionally true, and it has always been so. The Congress has the power to raise taxes to pay for a war. Even though we may disagree with the war, we have it in our power to say for the public good we are going to raise taxes to pay for a war. Congress also has the power, in my view, to say: The health care system is broken. We are going to raise taxes to fix it. I don’t think that is the right an-swer, but I think that is within our power. The Court said today the fine is real- ly a tax. Now that we know it is really a tax, what are we going to do about it? Are we going to leave in place the larg-est tax increase in modern history to fix health care or are we going to be smart enough, wise enough, and coura-geous enough to start over? I hope we are wise enough, courageous enough, and smart enough to start over and this time do it in a way that is truly bipartisan. The worst possible outcome for the American people is for the Congress to pass legislation that affects one-fifth or one-sixth of the economy and say this is not a tax, and at the end of the day that is the only way the law can stand is for it to be a tax. So I hope between now and the elec- tion we can have another debate about VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.039 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4707 June 28, 2012 health care. All those who stand by this product need to tell their constitu-ents: I believe in this product, and I am willing to tax you in a large way to make it happen. If we had had that de-bate to begin with, this bill would have never passed and we would have worked together. Second chances are hard to get in life. Congress now has a second chance. One final thought about Medicaid ex- pansion. Congress said we are going to expand Medicaid dramatically under this proposal to insure people not cov-ered by Medicaid today. If you are 133 percent above poverty, you would be included in Medicaid. In my State 31 percent of South Carolinians would be eligible for Medicaid under the Obama health care formula. That would mean an additional $1 billion of a matching requirement by the State of South Carolina to get the Federal money. That means my State would have to cut education, raise taxes, or cut pub-lic safety to come up with the money to match Medicaid expansion under the Obama health care act. The Supreme Court said we cannot do that to the States. We cannot ex-pand Medicaid dramatically, which will bankrupt States and tell them if they don’t agree with the expansion, they lose all the money under the program; that is coercive. In September of last year, along with Senator B ARRASSO , I introduced legis- lation called the Graham-Barrasso bill, which would allow States to opt-out of Obama Medicaid expansion and still re-ceive the money they receive under the current program. That is basically what the Court said we should be doing. So I hope the Republican leader will impress upon the Democratic lead-er to bring up the bill we introduced last September and legislatively allow States to opt out of Medicaid expan-sion under ObamaCare if they choose to. I guarantee there will be a bunch of red and blue States opting out of Med-icaid expansion under this bill because it will make them hopelessly bankrupt, and that is not the way to solve health care for the poor. That part of the bill needs to be addressed too. This is a historic ruling by the Su- preme Court, but for it really to be his-toric in its fullest sense, Congress should take this historic opportunity to revisit health care and get this right without a massive tax increase. I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, my friend from South Carolina ar-ticulated very well what happened today with the Supreme Court. I think it is going to be a wake-up call for a lot of people in America. I think it will, as he suggested, have a profound effect on the elections in November when people realize the Court has ruled that people who don’t have coverage are going to be penalized by $695 per individual, and families who do have coverage will have to pay an additional about $2,100, and the employers of America are going to be dealing with the govern-ment exchange. People are going to be concerned about it. I think they are going to want to send people to Con-gress in both the House and the Senate and in the White House who are going to change this system. So I stand on the Senate floor and say that is what I am predicting and we will see what happens. HIGHWAY REAUTHORIZATION I want to make one comment because we are going to vote shortly on a sig-nificant bill. It is the highway reau-thorization bill. It makes me very proud because we have been trying for a year and a half to do this. When we passed the last highway reauthoriza-tion bill, it was in 2005. At that time I was the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. It was, as I recall and going from memory, a $286.4 billion bill. It was for 5 years. Of course, that expired in 2009. The problem we have had since 2009 is that we have been operating on what they call extensions. Most people are not aware that when we operate on ex-tensions, we are operating with the same amount of money we are spending out of the highway trust fund, but we are only getting two-thirds of what we would get if it were a reauthorization. First of all, they can only do it in a short period of time. There is no plan-ning, and they have all said we lose about 30 to 33 percent of the amount of spending power or money that should be spent on highways, bridges, and maintenance. It is kind of funny because I have been ranked as the most conservative Member of this body at different times, and I am always in the top three. Yet I have always said I may be the most conservative, but I am a big spender in two areas: One is national defense and the other is transportation, and that is what this is all about. I have had occasion to talk to a lot of the new members of the conference committee over in the House and ex-plained to them the conservative posi-tion and the conservative vote on this is to vote for the highway reauthoriza-tion bill that is going to be coming up to us. Hopefully, it will be here to-night. It is going back and forth be-tween the House and Senate. I believe most of the conferees have already signed off on this bill, so it is coming up. It has been a long time in the mak-ing. I am very excited about it. Let me also say that while I take the position that the conservative vote is to vote for the highway reauthoriza-tion bill, I am not alone in this feeling. Mr. President, I would like to submit for the R ECORD a statement by the chairman of the American Conserv- ative Union. It is an op-ed by Al Cardenas, who is the chairman of the American Conservative Union. He pre-sents a strong case as to why this is the conservative position that should be taken. I ask unanimous consent that the statement and op-ed piece by the chair-man of the American Conservative Union be printed in the R ECORD . There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: [From the Examiner, June 21, 2012] CONSERVATIVES SHOULD BREAK TRANSPORTATION BILLGRIDLOCK (By Al Cardenas) The spending and debt crises of the past few years in Washington have forced an im-portant debate about the proper role of gov-ernment, and the need for prioritizing gov-ernment spending. The failed $800 billion stimulus, TARP, countless bailouts and Congress’ failure to make a serious attempt at controlling our $16 trillion debt have given many conserv-atives rightful anger over how Washington spends our money. Unfortunately, well-placed mistrust in Congress’ ability to spend our tax dollars is now jeopardizing legitimate spending projects, chief among them this year’s trans-portation funding bill. If Congress fails to act by June 30, important transportation projects critical to our national defense and our economy will lose their funding. The ef-fects on our already suffering economy will be far-reaching and profound. While there are important disagreements between members of the House and Senate on this bill, enough consensus exists on the broad framework that there’s no excuse for not passing it in time. First, the current framework does not con- tain any earmarks. This is a monumental achievement in its own right considering ‘‘Bridge to nowhere’’ and ‘‘John Murtha’s airport’’ served to make transportation ear-marks the poster children of wasteful pork spending. Second, the myriad of highway spending categories that used to serve as hiding places for pet projects has been re-duced from 87 down to 21. Third, thanks to the leadership of Senator Jim Inhofe and conservatives in the House, the cumbersome and unnecessary environ-mental review process for road construction projects will see significant reform. How much reform is up for debate, but we’re going to get something better than what we have now, that much is assured. Fourth, not passing a bill will hurt our al- ready suffering economy. While big-government Democrats mistak- enly place their economic faith in the reli-gion of government spending, conservatives know the economic pump is best primed by a robust private sector. Government cannot do much to stoke job creation on its own, as evidenced by President Obama’s repeated failures during the past three years. But gov-ernment can play a profound role in stalling job creation and hurting economic growth. Failure to pass a transportation bill would have a negative effect on commerce and the businesses that count on safe and reliable roads. Perhaps most importantly, those of us who believe in constitutional conservatism un-derstand that unlike all the things the Fed-eral Government wastes our money on, VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:17 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.045 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4708 June 28, 2012 transportation spending is at the core of what constitutes legitimate spending. Article One, Section Eight of the Constitu- tion specifically lists interstate road-build-ing as one of the delineated powers and re-sponsibilities vested in the federal govern-ment. In Federalist Paper #42, James Madi-son makes an early case for the federal gov-ernment’s role in maintaining a healthy in-frastructure, by stating ‘‘Nothing which tends to facilitate the intercourse between the states, can be deemed unworthy of the public care.’’ Let’s be clear—the legislation before Con- gress is still the product of a Democrat-ically-controlled Senate, and far from con-servative perfection. But there can be no de-nying that it represents a marked improve-ment over previous transportation funding bills. Enough progress has been made, vic-tories won, and concessions secured from Democrats, that conservatives should feel comfortable dropping their objections and working to ensure passage of a bill before June 30. The road to reforming government spend- ing will be long and winding, but conserv-atives have us headed in the right direction. Mr. INHOFE. I am looking forward to having this. Certainly, my State of Oklahoma is not the only State that has bridges and road problems. Another good thing we are waiting on—and I feel very confident we are going to be able to pass this out of the Senate—is the pilots’ bill of rights, which we are in the process of, hope-fully, getting done. When that time comes, I would like to be recognized to talk about some of the great exten-sions of justice to people who have been denied that justice heretofore just because they happen to be pilots. I will yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. Mr. COATS.

HEALTH CARE DECISION Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about the Su-preme Court ruling on health care. Ob-viously, we were all glued to the tele-vision set this morning and watched this historic and momentous decision. I was deeply disappointed with the rul-ing. I respect the Court and its work, but I was disappointed that the Court failed to strike down this law as many anticipated they would. I was dis-appointed because I believe the law has been deeply and fatally flawed from the very beginning. It became a major issue, of course, in the 2010 election as people watched this massive bill that impacts every Amer-ican get passed without bipartisan sup-port. The procedures were worked around and violated in order to pass— even though it was against the will of the majority of the American people. This was a 2,700-page monstrosity so infamously described by the then- Speaker of the House as something we have to pass first so you can find out what’s in it. Well, we found out what’s in it. We have had 2 years to examine this and we have seen parts of it being played out, with more to come. I think what we have learned is this bill is fatally flawed and it ought to be repealed. It doesn’t mean we don’t have health care issues we should deal with, but we need to deal with it in a bipar-tisan way that can be better explained to the American people and that is af-fordable. It is labeled the Affordable Care Act, but it is anything but afford-able. In a time of deep recession and over a period of the last 2 or 3 years of a stagnant economy, this law adds a burden of regulation and taxation that is working against our ability to come out of this deep hole of economic dis-tress. Americans found out what was in this bill, and I think it reaffirmed many of their deep concerns about going forward with a plan that tries to wrap up the entire U.S. health care system in one big ball—2,700 pages worth. It reaffirms the people’s con-cerns with federal rules and regula-tions and taxes and mandates. The American people are saying that this is not how we want reform of our health care system. We want to make it more affordable and more accessible, but let-ting Washington essentially decide how to go forward without giving flexibility to the States and flexibility to the pri-vate sector to initiate reforms clearly is not what the American people—or at least the majority of the American people—were wanting. Despite the promises that were made about the impact of this bill by those who authored it and by the President, middle-class Americans have found that the health care law is a massive tax. The Supreme Court reaffirmed that today. This is not just a penalty; this is a massive tax on working Amer-icans—and not just the rich. It is a tax on the middle class and it is a tax on every American taxpayer, even though the President has insisted, now fa-mously, on YouTube and every news station, that this was not a tax on the middle class or a tax on any Ameri-cans. Families have found out their insur- ance premiums are going up, not down, as was promised by those who sup-ported this bill and authored this bill. Seniors have found out they may not be able to keep the insurance plan they have and could lose access to Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage is a program many seniors have enrolled in and found to be successful in address-ing their health care needs at a reason-able cost. Business owners found out they would be fined $2,000 per employee if they failed to provide workers with a health care insurance plan approved by Uncle Sam. I don’t know how many business owners I have talked to in In-diana over the past couple of years who have said they have sat down with their employees and discussed with them how much they are able to pro- vide in health care coverage without cutting jobs and without sinking the company. Many companies have worked out different types of agree-ments with employees and various types of plans based on their ability to provide that kind of coverage accept-able by both the employees and the owners of the business. Now all of these agreements are wiped out because it is determined that Washington will de-cide what the minimum level of the plan should be. Several business owners have told me they simply can’t run their business in this economy on the low margins, if any margins they are achieving, and provide that kind of in-crease in insurance or opt out of it and pay a fine of $2,000 per employee. For those businesses with under 50 employees, there is an exemption. Other businesses have said: Guess what. I have 47 employees. Does anyone think I am going to hire over 50? No way. No way am I going to push myself into a category where I have to pay a fine of $2,000 per employee if I don’t comply with the health care mandates out of Washington, DC. So what we see is a lot of payment of overtime for ex-isting workers but we don’t see hiring. We don’t see the expansion of hiring, particularly in small business, because of the so-called Affordable Care Act. I have spoken to patients and doctors all over the State of Indiana, including health care providers, insurance com-panies, hospital administrators, doc-tors who are part of a group and those individuals who are in a private prac-tice, and all of the other entities that are engaged in health care. They all have major concerns with this law and to a group, they have opposed this Af-fordable Health Care Act, or so it is de-scribed. We have a dynamic medical device industry in Indiana, as we do in several States across this country. It is one of the cutting-edge, leading industries in terms of our ability to provide new and innovative products to make people’s lives healthier and safer and to prevent a number of unintended consequences from various medical procedures. They learned after reading this act that they were going to be subject to a 2.3-per-cent tax levied on their gross receipts because they were a pay-for for this bill. These companies that make pace-makers, artificial joints, and surgical tools find that this tax is something that drives them to the point where they need to think about transferring their business overseas, or part of their business overseas, or not hire the workers they wish to hire. This is a tax imposed on one of our dynamic and in-novative industries that is leading in our exports. This industry may no longer be able to compete under this tax. Just because this ruling that came down today saying the health care law is constitutional does not mean it is the right policy for us to go forward. The law remains unpopular and VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A28JN6.003 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4709 June 28, 2012 unaffordable. I wish to state here today that I am committed to working with my colleagues to repeal the health care law and give our citizens the power and the flexibility to make their own deci-sions relative to their health care and to use those innovative ideas that are out there to put a much better package together that addresses the real ques- tion of rising health care costs and ac-cess. I have traveled our State and lis- tened to all of these providers and I have asked them this question: If the health care law is struck down by the Supreme Court, what would you pro-pose? Because we still have a problem here. We have rising health care costs that have to be contained, we have an access problem, and we have a number of other problems in terms of gaining access to coverage and payment for health care issues. What would you propose? I have a long list of answers. I have talked about it here on the floor. I talked about it during the cam-paign. All across my State I have talked about the things I have learned from listening to the people who are on the frontline doing this business every day. There are all kinds of innovative solutions out there. There are all kinds of things we ought to be looking at. I know all of us who support the repeal of the current law are committed to bringing forward sensible, affordable, cost-effective, quality-effective solu-tions to our health care issues. What the Supreme Court essentially has done is say that this issue is for Congress. Congress represents the peo-ple. We need to be representative of the people. So what we need to do now is listen to the people. It is the people who will decide the future of health care for this country. I believe it is the people who will decide in this coming election. It is the people who will de-cide whether they want evermore Washington—evermore taxing and spending, evermore debt, evermore Federal mandates and regulations—or whether they want to approach this in a different way that can reduce spend-ing, empower individuals, give States greater flexibility, and bring forward sensible, step-by-step, incremental, af-fordable, tested, proven ways of ad-dressing our rising health care costs. So the Supreme Court has turned it back to Congress. It is our responsi-bility now to go forward and represent all those who were not listened to when this bill was run through this Congress in a way that violated a lot of our pro-cedures and in a way that I believe went against the majority will of the American people. Here we are, and now it is back on us, and we now need to stand up and take responsibility. Those who voted for it will be defending it, of course. Those who voted against it—or those of us who were here, partly be-cause it was an issue in the 2010 cam-paign—are here to not just simply say we don’t like what is there but to offer also positive solutions to the problem. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Rhode Island. Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. Presi- dent. Today’s Supreme Court ruling that the Affordable Care Act is constitu-tional and the law of the land is a vic-tory, I believe, for Rhode Islanders and for all Americans. Families will no longer fear financial ruin if a child be-comes seriously ill or face denial of health coverage due to a child’s pre-existing condition, and they will no longer have to worry that the terms of their coverage will run out as they are being treated after a major medical emergency. Indeed, tonight, all Americans can sleep a little easier knowing they and their children will have access to qual-ity, affordable health care. This is the type of security we want for our chil-dren and what this law will provide. Indeed, for the first time in our his- tory, parents can, with some con-fidence, trust that whatever lies ahead, their child at least will have access to affordable health care. We couldn’t say that with any confidence a few years ago—even 2 years ago—before we took up this legislative activity. This law has already benefited many people in Rhode Island, including indi-viduals, families, and businesses. Chil-dren up to age 26 are now able to re-main on their parents’ health insur-ance plan. In Rhode Island, this has benefited an estimated 9,000 young adults and their parents. Over 15,000 Rhode Island seniors have saved a total of $14 million on prescription drugs since the law was enacted, an average of close to $600 annually. Seniors will continue to save on their prescription drug costs until the existing coverage gap is closed and will continue to have access to free preventive care such as annual wellness visits and screenings. Rhode Islanders can now expect re- bates if an insurance company spends too much on administrative costs and CEO bonuses instead of on their health care. For too long, health insurance com- panies got away with increasing pre-miums and decreasing coverage, which resulted in higher costs and unfair practices. Beginning in 2014, Rhode Is-landers will be able to purchase health insurance on a new exchange, a single point of entry where they can evaluate the costs and coverage of health insur-ance options. They will, indeed, for the first time for many Rhode Islanders, have a real choice about the health care they receive and the insurance they purchase. According to Families USA, 97,000 Rhode Islanders will have access to tax credits to make their cov-erage more affordable. Thousands more childless adults will gain coverage through the Medicaid Program. Now that the Court has spoken, I hope we can work on a bipartisan basis to do what we must do, and that is to create jobs and improve our economy. This health care decision is a landmark decision, but the work now—the work of all of us—should be to reinvigorate our economy so that not only can peo-ple have confidence in their health care, but they can have the further and indeed very primary confidence that they will have meaningful work. In that respect, I am glad Congress is poised to take action that will enable millions of students and families across the country to breathe a sigh of relief about the student loans they need to borrow for the upcoming aca-demic year. Everyone, from every sec-tor of the country, will tell us that the key to our future is higher education, that we cannot be competitive in a world economy unless we have the best educated students in this country, that we cannot be the powerful force we have been in the world unless we have education. The key for so many jobs today is going on past high school into postsec-ondary education. Yet we are days away—unless we act—from doubling the loan interest rate we are charging our students. There has been quite a bit of stalling tactics for months. I hope those tactics are over, as the July 1 deadline ap-proaches. I hope we are soon to take action to prevent the doubling of the subsidized Stafford loan interest rate. I would like to thank majority leader H ARRY REIDfor his tireless efforts to negotiate a bipartisan solution. I also wish to recognize and thank three other individuals who were absolutely critical in this effort, who were leaders, without equivocation, with deep con-viction; that is, Chairman T OMHARKIN of the HELP Committee, who led with vigor throughout this effort; Senator S HERROD BROWN of Ohio, who has been committed to this effort; and also our colleague in the House of Representa-tives, Congressman J OECOURTNEY of Connecticut. They have been extraor-dinary. Last January, Congressman C OURT - NEYand I introduced legislation to per- manently extend the law that makes college loans more affordable for mil-lions of students across the country. President Obama called on Congress to address the student loan interest rate hike in his State of the Union Ad-dress. Back then, many Republicans scoffed at the idea. In fact, they voted for budgets that assumed the interest rate would double, and they did that without any apparent equivocation. But thanks to students and families across the country who raised their voices and made themselves heard, my colleagues got the message: Fixing the student loan interest rate matters. It matters a great deal. It matters to in-dividuals trying to build a better life for themselves. It matters to parents whose dream to give their kids a chance at a better life depends on being able to afford college. It matters to our shared economic future because the single most important investment we as a nation can make is to educate our young people. So thanks to groups such as Campus Progress, USSA, U.S. PIRG, Young VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.048 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4710 June 28, 2012 Invincibles, and the Rebuild the Dream coalition that pushed this issue to the forefront where it belongs. The letters, e-mails, calls, visits, bus tours, and campus rallies made a difference. We should soon be voting, I hope, to keep this student loan rate low for an-other year. However, it is important to remember this is only a temporary, short-term fix. Now we need to develop longer term solutions to the growing burden of student loan debt, the rising cost of college, and the need to improve higher education outcomes so students complete their degrees and get the full benefit of their investment in edu-cation. These are tough issues, but we have to address them head on. Our economy and our future depends on addressing these issues. It is estimated, for example, that more than 60 percent of the jobs will require some postsecondary education by the year 2018. In 2010, only 38 per-cent of working-age adults held a 2- year or 4-year degree. We have very few years to go from 40 percent to 60 per-cent. That gap represents the challenge we have in being a competitive eco-nomic force in the world. Certainly, if we are ever going to close that gap, we have to make sure we do not double the interest rate on Stafford loans, as a first step. But, as I suggest, there are many other steps we must take. We have to address the rising cost of college. The cost of attending college has increased by 559 percent since 1985—559 percent— rising far faster than costs for gasoline, health care, and other consumer items. Keeping student loans affordable and interest rates low is one part of the so-lution. Providing more grant aid through Pell grants and other pro-grams is another. We need to call on institutions to do their part to keep costs in check. Yes, the college community has to rally around this and has to think of innova-tive ways to provide excellent edu-cation at a lower cost, a more afford-able cost. States have to play a role too. When State support for higher education goes down, tuition goes up. The crises of so many States—real cri-ses, difficult crises—have forced them to reduce their support for higher edu-cation, and the result, as I suggest, has been tuitions climb, and that is an-other burden middle America and mid-dle-class, middle-income families are bearing. I look forward to working with my colleagues on developing a comprehen-sive approach to addressing these issues. Also, I would just like to say, I hope we are on the verge—at least for the next year—of avoiding a doubling of in-terest rates on student loans. We have a long way to go to ensure that every American with talent and drive and the skills has the means to go to college. This is an important first step. There are many more we must take, and I hope we do that very quickly. I yield the floor and suggest the ab- sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. F RANKEN ). The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk pro- ceeded to call the roll. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. F RANKEN ). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes and bring every-body up to date. We have had wonder-ful cooperation in the last several weeks. We have gotten a lot done. Our passing the three bills that are left to do—student loans, flood insurance, and the highway bill—would be a signifi-cant accomplishment. We are going to do it; it is only a question of when. A lot of the committees and the chairs and ranking members worked late last night. I talked to CBO today. They didn’t get the information that they started scoring until 4 a.m. They are moving forward and doing their best. As with all agreements, things come up, and at this point everything appears to be just right. The commit-tees of jurisdiction have indicated they have worked through all these matters. They have completed the drafting of a revised version of the conference re-port. We expect this to be filed momen-tarily—it could have already been filed. But what we have done many times is we have voted on what the House has filed before they passed it. We have done that many times. It is standard procedure. Right now we don’t have the consent from all Senators to do that, but that could be forthcoming. I will report back to the Senate within the next hour, after I find out whether we can finish this work tonight or whether we have to come back tomorrow. Everyone stay tuned. At this point, I can’t express enough appreciation to everyone—Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate. As I laid out to my chairmen at the lunch I had yes-terday, this has been truly an example of what legislation is all about—com-promise. Compromise really sounds good. Legislation is the art of com-promise—until you are faced, as a Sen-ator, with something you may not get because of the overall good of the bill. Sometimes we have to understand that we have to give things up for the bet-terment of this country. We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. So everyone understands that to this point. As I have indicated, we will know within the next hour, and I will report back as to whether we can finish to-night or come back tomorrow. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Illinois. SURFACE TRANSPORTATION Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and especially Sen-ators B OXER and I NHOFE , as well as their counterparts on the Commerce Committee and the Banking Com- mittee, who have put so much time into this bill, so much effort. We are trying now to get this important and complex bill right and then to secure the support of both sides of the aisle to move it forward. A lot of work has been going into it. Everybody is working hard to try to accomplish what the ma-jority leader has spelled out. I am sure he will tell us if there are any develop-ments. POLITICAL PRISONERS Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, off and on and for some time I have come to the floor to speak about an issue that doesn’t receive a lot of attention, which is political prisoners in foreign lands—journalists in Cameroon, an AIDS activist in Uzbekistan, and a lot of others. I am pleased that over the years, working with many of my col-leagues, we have been able to see many of these innocent political victims re-leased. Former Senator Brownback, as well as Senators C ARDIN , CASEY , Ken- nedy, L IEBERMAN , and R UBIO have all been part of a joint effort to deal with these political prisoners. Sadly, there is no shortage of polit- ical prisoners in this world. They lan-guish in horrible prisons in places such as Iran and North Korea. Today I want to focus on a number of them, and I will preface my remarks by apologizing ahead of time for my pronunciation of these names. Some of these are ex-tremely difficult to pronounce for those of us in the States, particularly from the Midwest. I suppose one might start typically with the most outrageous case, but, tragically, all of the cases I speak to fit that definition. Let me start with the heartbreaking case from 6 years ago— that of Gambian journalist Ebrima Manneh. Manneh was a reporter for the Daily Observer newspaper. He was allegedly detained by plainclothes Gambian se-curity officials. He was held incommu-nicado for years, although he was seen during the initial years of his deten-tion by witnesses in at least one deten-tion facility and one hospital. No one has seen him for years. It is possible he died in custody. But imagine the pain and uncertainty of his family, who have no help and no answers. The Economic Community of West African States Court of Justice, which has jurisdiction over Gambia, and the United Nations Working Group on Ar-bitrary Detention both ruled against the Gambian Government on the case and called for his release. After years of waiting, the Gambian Government recently requested United Nations help to investigate Manneh’s case and the death of one other journalist. This was a welcome move by the Gambian Government, and I hope ongo-ing discussions with the United Na-tions will expedite the investigation and bring some resolution to the case and answers for Manneh’s family. Some years ago, there was a change in leadership in Turkmenistan, one VerDate Mar 15 2010 02:17 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.050 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4711 June 28, 2012 that many hoped would open that country’s closed and repressive polit-ical system. Unfortunately, President Berdimuhamedov has yet to meet those modest expectations. One would think in a country where the President wins an election with a 97-percent vote, and where there is an annual week of hap-piness, that Turkmen leadership could be more gracious to its political oppo-nents. Unfortunately, the following ex-amples demonstrate just the opposite. Gulgeldy Annaniyazov is a long-time political dissident who left Turkmeni-stan in 2000 to settle in Norway as a po-litical refugee. He reportedly returned to Turkmenistan in June 2008 to visit his family and was arrested. After a closed trial on October 7, he was sen-tenced to 11 years in prison. Annakurban Amanklychev and Sapardurdy Khadzhiev are members of the human rights organization Turk-menistan Helsinki Foundation. They were convicted in August 2006 after trials of only 2 hours and sentenced to 6 and 7 years in jail on charges that were never very clear. Unfortunately, we don’t have a pho- tograph of Mr. Khadzhiev. Turkmeni-stan Government officials have been quoted as asserting these individuals were arrested and convicted for ‘‘gath-ering slanderous information to spread public discontent.’’ The legal bases for their detention are suspect at best and raise serious concerns of political intimidation, questionable charges, closed trials, and inappropriately punitive punishment. In May 2010, more than 20 Senators— and that is not an easy feat in the Sen-ate—signed a letter to Secretary of State Clinton urging the administra-tion to raise these cases with the Turk-menistan leadership. I know the State Department did in fact take those steps, and I thank them, but I hope they will continue. In November 2010, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention released its opinion that the arrest and continued detention of the Turkmeni-stan Helsinki Foundation members is arbitrary and in violation of the Uni-versal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That United Nations group called on the Turkmen Government to immediately release them. Sadly, they continued to languish under harsh sentences that include hard labor, torture, and forced psycho-tropic drug injections. To the leaders of Turkmenistan, I say, if you want to change the image of your nation in the world, you must re-lease these and other political pris-oners. Some who follow this may wonder what difference it makes if I make a speech on the floor of the Senate about someone languishing in a prison in Turkmenistan. All I can tell you is that after years of doing this, it does make a difference. It turns out, people listen. And when they listen, some-times they react, and often in a posi- tive way. These people languishing in prisons do not believe anybody in the outside world knows they are alive. Groups are trying to make sure others are aware of that fact, and that is why I come to the floor, as many of my col-leagues do. It is hard to believe in Europe there is still one regime like that of Alex-ander Lukashenko. He is often known as the last dictator of Europe. I have been to Belarus twice, once with the Helsinki Commission group, led by Senator C ARDIN of Maryland, where we actually met this President Lukashenko; and most recently I went there after the highly suspect 2010 elec-tions held in December. What was egre-gious about this election was that President Lukashenko, on the night of the election, beat up and arrested all the candidates who had the nerve to run against him, as well as hundreds of Belarusian citizens who showed up in central Minsk to protest his actions. Lukashenko’s barbaric behavior, and that of his KGB henchmen—and, yes, Belarus still has something called a KGB security service—earned him sweeping condemnation from Europe and the United States, further iso-lating his nation and hurting his own people. Sadly, today, a year and a half after this outrage, Lukashenko is still hold-ing the man in this photograph. This Presidential candidate—Mikalai Statkevich—was sentenced to 6 years in a medium security prison for having the nerve to run against Lukashenko. At least 6, and as many as 13, other protestors from the election still sit in jail. This is outrageous in Europe today or anywhere on the planet, for that mat-ter. It is time for President Luka-shenko to let this man and these peo-ple go. Next I turn to Vietnam. Although our bilateral relationship continues to improve with Vietnam, we cannot ig-nore the troubling disregard for free-dom of speech in that country. It is il-lustrated by the unfounded detention of the popular blogger Nguyen Van Hai, better known as Dieu Cay. Let me show this photograph of him. He is the head of the Free Vietnamese Journalists’ Club, and as such Cay has been detained almost continuously by Vietnamese authorities since 2008, when he was convicted and tried for trumped-up tax evasion charges. In 2009, the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention highlighted Cay’s case, as well as the ‘‘illegal arrests’’ and continued persecution of a number of other Internet bloggers. In October 2010, on the day Cay was due to be released, having fulfilled his sentence, he was transferred to a new jail and re-arrested for violating a se-curity provision that prohibits propa-gandizing against the government. The propaganda in question—3-year-old blog postings. The subject of his propa-ganda—freedom of speech, and other issues considered by the government to be too sensitive, such as labor strikes and the trials of two human rights law-yers. Cay’s arrest is part of a well-docu- mented trend in Vietnam in which na-tional security concerns have been cited as a pretext for arrests and crimi-nal investigations. The State Department’s Human Rights report notes the Vietnamese Government is increasing suppression of dissent, increasing measures to limit freedom of the press, speech, assembly and association, and increasing restric-tions on Internet freedom. The trend is clear, and it is very concerning. Secretary Clinton noted in a speech last year on Internet Rights and Wrongs, ‘‘In Vietnam, bloggers who criticize the government are arrested and abused.’’ It is long overdue that Vietnamese leaders release Cay and stop harassing journalists and bloggers. Lastly, on Saudi Arabia, our ally on many important issues, but also a friend with whom we have vast dif-ferences when it comes to basic free-doms and women’s rights. Let me tell a recent story that is truly hard to be-lieve. Since early 2012, the Saudi Govern- ment has imprisoned 23-year-old blogger Hamza Kashgari. His crime? He tweeted an imaginary conversation with the Prophet Muhammad. That ac-tion sparked a spate of death threats, causing him to remove the tweet and flee to New Zealand in fear of his life. While stopping in Malaysia for a plane transfer, Malaysian authorities de-tained him until their Saudi counter-parts swooped in and returned him to Saudi Arabia under arrest. Back in the kingdom—facing accusa- tions of blasphemy and calls for his execution by top clerics—he repented before the Saudi court and showed great remorse, asking for forgiveness. That was 4 months ago, yet he remains imprisoned, awaiting his fate, with no sense when a decision will be made. I can imagine his actions sparking a debate in Saudi Arabia, but leading to calls for a death sentence for blas-phemy? In today’s world, that is hard to believe. Saudi Arabia has initiated steps to- ward social, educational, judicial, and economic reform, and we encourage them to do more. Immediately freeing Mr. Kashgari would be an important move. This man has suffered enough and deserves his freedom now. These are just a sample of the many political prisoners who still suffer in parts of the world. I want them and their families and the governments that unjustly imprison them to know they are not forgotten. I and my col-leagues here in the Senate will con-tinue to do our best to draw attention to their plight, work for their release, and stand up for the cause of human rights in the United States and around the world.

Last year we wrote a bill called MAP–21. That stands for Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century. I was proud to see this bill become a bipar-tisan bill, with Senator I NHOFE work- ing with me and his staff and my staff working together as one. When we got it out of the committee, I think it was a unanimous, or close to unanimous, vote. I know when our young people learn how a bill becomes a law it sounds a little easier than it really is. I often think, in my spare time I should write a little pamphlet on how a bill really becomes a law because I would say to the young people who are here today, as well as those who might be listen-ing, it is a little trickier than it sounds because when we learn about how a bill becomes a law in school, it is very sim-ply put. The bill starts in a committee in the House or Senate, and it moves to the floor of that body. Then it starts in a committee in the other body, it moves to the floor of that body. It passes both Chambers. If it is identical, it goes to the President. If there are differences, there is a conference committee, and then it goes to the President. The President either signs it or vetoes it. If he signs it, it is a done deal. If he ve-toes it, we need to have a whole lot of votes—two-thirds—to override. So that is how it is taught in schools, and it is absolutely true. But getting it to the point where we are now, where we await a conference report, is some-times a very long and winding path. This one was a long and winding path. I think we are where we are, at the point where we hope to vote soon on it, because people were willing to meet each other halfway. I have been saying for a long time, we all stand in our respective corners and insist that it is our way or the highway and nothing ever gets done. We must come together, and the Sen-ate proved it can come together around our version of the highway bill. It passed by 74 votes. We were hopeful the House would just take it up and pass it. It didn’t happen that way. They wrote a less comprehensive bill; they sent it over; and then we went into a con-ference committee. There was a lot of difficulty because there were issues that were simply not seen in the same light between the House and Senate. I would have to say, through all of this Senator I NHOFE and I, Republicans and Democrats, on the EPW Com-mittee were united. But we didn’t have that unifying factor with the House Republicans. I want to thank every member of the conference committee, Democratic and Republican, House and Senate, because everyone worked ex-tremely hard. They worked hard. They were knowledgeable. Their staffs worked hard. They asked a lot of ques-tions. They cared a tremendous amount about the policies. The great news about the bill that is coming out of the conference com-mittee is that it is a jobs bill, first and foremost. It is going to save about 1.9 million—almost 2 million—jobs that are currently held in the private sec-tor, and it will create up to 1 million new jobs through an expanded TIFIA program. TIFIA is a program that fronts the funds for local government to have a revenue stream, and the le-verage on that is about 30 to 1. So if you have an amount of approximately $1 billion, you will be able to get $30 billion of economic activity. So that is a good part that we can all be proud of. That is a fact. The bill will be coming soon, we hope. It is not here yet, and it is not done yet, but it is close. What we hope we will have before us is a bill that cre-ates close to 2 million—I am so tired. I have to say, I haven’t gotten much sleep in the past 3 days because we have been working nonstop. I will say it again. We protect almost 2 million jobs that are currently held in the private sector, and we will cre-ate up to 1 million; hence, the 3 million jobs that are relying on this bill. We have thousands of businesses that care a lot about what we do. These are general contractors, these are equip-ment dealers, these are people in the concrete industry. I can tell you these organizations of business and labor have been behind us every inch of the way. When I was giving up hope be-cause I didn’t think we could move for-ward, they were there to say: Keep on going. And they weighed in. I think the work product reflects the fact that we would never, ever give up. There is a lot of talk about, What did Democrats give up? What did Repub-licans give up? Let’s just say this is a negotiation between Republicans and Democrats, a negotiation between the House and Senate, and not everybody got what he or she wanted. That is for sure. But I just want to say to people who might be listening that in a negotia-tion nobody gets everything they want. You have to meet each other halfway, and that is what happened in this nego-tiation. We both wanted to see this as a re- form bill. The Senate brought a pack-age together that took the 90 programs down to 30, and that pretty much sur-vived the conference committee. We also did some more reforms, certainly, on project delivery because all sides agree it is taking too long to get some of these public works projects done. It is taking sometimes 15 years, 14 years, 13 years to do a road start to finish or to do a bridge. We need to make sure we can move faster because our econ-omy needs that, but still, in my view, protect the rights of citizens through-out this country to ensure their com-munities are taken care of, that there is no damage to their communities, that the air quality is protected, the water quality is protected. We were able to keep those environ- mental laws while we were tough on deadlines and milestones and very tough to say: This is it. If you can’t finish in this time, and we are trying to get this for 15 years to 8 years per project—if you don’t do that, you have to explain why. There has to be a real-ly good reason why these projects would be delayed. I believe the funding in the bill is fair. Every single State is protected. This is a 2-year-3-month bill. Every State will get the amount of money they got last year, plus inflation. That is very important. It is the current level of funding with the inflation put in, and every State can now know, if and when this bill passes, that they can count on that funding for 2 years and 3 months. Everything is paid for. There are a lot of comments about, what did we do about pedestrian walk-ways and bike paths. I want to be clear. That was an intense subject of negotiations. There were those who wanted no funds set aside for bike paths, pedestrian paths, and it was very clear—safe streets, safe roads to school, et cetera—we had to negotiate on this. Honestly, I think what has come out is a good thing, and let me explain why. We kept the same amount of funding, same set-aside percentage for these transportation alternatives, but what we said was, for the first time, half of those funds will go directly to locals, will go to the metropolitan planning organizations, will go to the large cities. That is key because we want the local people, who know their area best, making these decisions. We protected those funds. The only way anyone in the State can use those funds is if there is a nationally de-clared disaster and there are some un-obligated funds around—yes, that could be borrowed but must be paid back from any supplemental appropriation. On the State portion, which is the other 50 percent, we built in more flexi-bility, and there are a lot of people who are calling this a cut. It is not a cut. Some States will use it all. I say to the people in the States who are worried about it, use your pressure, use your power, use your grassroots strength to make sure you lobby your State legis-latures and your Governors to provide for safe streets to schools, for bike paths, for pedestrian walkways. These are very important safety issues. VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.053 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4713 June 28, 2012 I know not everyone is happy, but I wanted to be clear on that. If the choice is between doing away with that wonderful program, which I think is wonderful, or making a few concessions on flexibility, I think we did the right thing. I honestly do. This bill is all paid for. I have to thank so much Senator M AXBAUCUS and his team, the Republican members of the Finance Committee, and also the team in the House headed by Mr. C AMP because they came up with a pay-for that people on all sides can live with. It gives us that security for 2 years and 3 months. We don’t have any riders on this bill. I know some people very much wanted it. We don’t have them. It became part of the give-and-take at the end of the day. Two provisions that I lament are not on there are the oceans trust fund, which is part of the RESTORE Act, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund that was also part of the RESTORE Act. I lament that those provisions are gone. I commit myself to working with Senator W HITEHOUSE on the oceans trust fund and Senator B AUCUS on the Land and Water Conservation Fund to get that done. But I have to be com-pletely, totally frank with the Senate; we just could not get it done. There was nothing we could offer or give that would allow us to move forward with those two very critical environmental programs. I tell you, our oceans deserve atten- tion and our land deserves attention. These issues are certainly not going away. Having said that, the rest of the RESTORE Act is in this bill. That means those folks in the Gulf States who were so harmed by this horrible BP spill will be able to use some of those fines as they come in to restore— that is why we called it the RESTORE Act—restore their environments, re-store their fisheries, restore the dam-age that was done by that horrific BP spill. We don’t know how much money will come from those fines. We will watch it very carefully. But we know that when they do come—if this bill passes, and I am very hopeful it will— our Gulf States will have the help they need. I want to say to the people, particu- larly in Louisiana, whom I visited many times, your Senators work very hard. I would say M ARYLANDRIEU took the lead on this. Senator V ITTER was on the conference. I want to say that M ARY LANDRIEU —you know her well— is unrelenting, and she was very clear with us. I want to say to my friend in the chair, from Alaska, how helpful he was to us, pointing out some of the great unmet needs he is dealing with in his State, a beautiful State, a very inter-esting State that has unique needs. I want him to know how much I appre-ciated his working with us, giving us the facts as we needed them. I also thank Senator M URKOWSKI , but I par- ticularly want to say to Senator BEGICH , thank you. You happen to be in the chair, and I believe you were men-tally effective for your State. Really, you made the case for fairness. I hope you are comfortable with how this bill turned out. I have never met a team of more dedicated staff—never. Again, they are not resting because we are not done. Until we are done, they are not resting. But we are talking seriously about this staff getting 3 or 4 hours of sleep over the last 2 or 3 days. The issues were still coming at us in ways we could not believe at noon today. Last night we had to work out some issues. It has been, in many ways, a very dif- ficult negotiation but certainly, if and when this bill comes before us and it is passed, a very satisfying one. I have to mention Bettina Poirier, who is my chief of staff and chief coun-sel. I have never seen anyone more pro-fessional, more energetic, more persua-sive. I have to thank her counterparts: David, Grant, Andrew, Jason, Tyler, Mary, Kate, and Paul, all of whom were just amazing. If I left anyone out, for-give me; I will correct it in the R ECORD if I did. I have to say to the staff of Senator INHOFE that you were amazing—part of the team. You worked together. If we had disagreements, we talked them out, but for the most part we were on the same page. So Ruth and James, you know who you are. You also have had a very rough few days, working very hard on this. Congressman M ICA’s staff also worked very hard, and they are very tough negotiators, but we were able to talk out our differences. It was not al-ways pleasant to deal with it because people see things in different ways, but we got it done. We are not out of the woods yet in the sense that we do not have the bill before us. We are awaiting a decision made by the leaders as to when we will have this vote. But I would like to say that I believe, as I stand tonight, that really the work of the conference is completed, and that is very rewarding. The last thing I want to say is a huge thank you to the outside groups that have stood by my side this entire time. I tell you, I have had conference calls with them for months and months, sometimes four times a week, some-times three times a week, sometimes six times a week, seriously, sometimes on Saturday, Fridays, Mondays—when-ever we needed to touch base. This is an amazing coalition of people—work-ers from organized labor, people from the construction trades. The chamber of commerce and AFL/CIO worked to-gether. That is a rarity, you know, in today’s very difficult atmosphere where everyone is arguing over every-thing—the granite people, the cement people. I want to say something to a gen- tleman—I will not identify his name— who brought a couple of cement trucks. We had a rally. I think Senator B EGICH was there. After the rally, we were say-ing: Pass the bill, get the bill done. I talked to this gentleman. He identified himself as a conservative Republican who is so much for this bill. One of the most touching things that happened was that he introduced me to two of his drivers who came over to meet me. As I stood there with these two gentle-men and the owner of the business, I realized how much they were counting on us. What we do here matters. What we do here should matter. What we do here is literally life and death for the con-struction industry, for the business end and for the workers. We know—our President and all of us—we all know this economic recov-ery is too slow. One of the things that is weighing us down is the construction industry. One of the things that is weighing it down is the transportation sector. We know that if we do not do our job and we pass another extension here, that is a signal that the construc-tion industry is going to suffer and suf-fer mightily. We cannot have that. We are on the brink of getting this done. I know I have left out a lot of people I want to thank. I do not have really a written speech here in front of me. I will go back and I will correct the record if I left anyone out. But we are close to getting this done. Whether it is in the next few hours or more than a few hours, I believe we will get it done. All the people who brought us to this day—I should mention Senator R EID, our majority leader, who never gave up even though I was—at one point, I am sure he was ducking me as I walked around because I would always say: Let’s keep going, Mr. Leader. And he did. He kept on going. When we went over to meet with Speaker B OEHNER was a very important moment, with Chairman M ICA. It was important. I think it helped us at that point to realize that everyone did want to have a bill. I have to say that the Democrats in the House—I am sure it has been very difficult for them because they had so many priorities as well. But they were very clear, day after day, pushing hard for a bill, until finally everybody came together and passed some messages to the conferees that said: Get the job done. And everybody came together on that one—get the job done. For me personally, this has been a very important day. This is a day when I think we are very close to getting a transportation bill done. It is also a day that President Obama will forever remember, where the cen-terpiece of his work was upheld as con-stitutional by the Supreme Court. We all know we cannot go back to the days when people with preexisting condi-tions suffered and could not get insur-ance. We just cannot go back to the days when being a woman was consid-ered a preexisting condition. It was im-possible for her to get insurance. We cannot go back to the days when kids were thrown off their parents’ health insurance at 18. We can’t go back to VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.055 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4714 June 28, 2012 the days that seniors were going broke, having to choose between a drug that was lifesaving or having dinner that night. In my State, 6 million Californians are getting preventive services. They are getting mammograms, cancer screenings, and everything they need now because of this health care bill. There are 300,000-plus senior citizens who are getting help paying for their prescription drugs and 300,000 more stu-dents who are now on their parents’ in-surance. We are going to hear a lot of outrage about how this was bad for America. Let me just say that I thought today was a critical day for America. No piece of legislation is perfect. We will have to fix this, that, or the other in everything we do whether it is in a transportation bill or health care bill, but I think we need to move forward. We need to not go backward. We need to make sure that health care in Amer-ica doesn’t become such an expensive burden for all of our people because it just drags down our families and it doesn’t enable them to do for their kids and for their moms and dads. So I think today was quite a day for the history books, and I look forward to working across the aisle in every-thing we do here, whether it is trans-portation or health care or anything else, to make life better for people, not to make it worse. I think if we all do that and if we listen to each other, we can get things done. I thank the Chair. I notice there is no one on the floor at this time, so I would note the ab-sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. HEALTH CARE DECISION Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share a few thoughts about the Su-preme Court’s ruling today and the sta-tus of the health care bill. I believe the health care bill cannot be justified as written and will have to be changed. It will have to be repealed, and we have to start over. It is just that simple. As ranking member of the Budget Committee, I began to look at the numbers we have had. Our team is going to redouble their effort in the weeks to come so we can know pre-cisely how much this legislation will cost. As that becomes more and more understood by the American people, it will be clear that we do not have the money to pass the bill. I know a lot of people are confident that it will undermine the right of an individual American to see the doctor of their choice, despite the President’s protestations. Even I believe today that people will not be able to continue to keep their insurance—at least not all people will be able to—and there will be other different problems. There is a real concern that under the legisla-tion the quality of health care will go down. I believe that is accurate for a lot of reasons, and people like Dr. B AR- RASSO and Dr. C OBURN have explained that in great detail. As a member of the Budget Com- mittee, I want to share some thoughts about the financing of the legislation to raise the issue of why we cannot go forward with it. The President promised the Amer- ican people before a joint session of Congress, right down the hall in the House Chamber: ‘‘Now, add it all up, and the plan that I’m proposing will cost around $900 billion over 10 years.’’ Now, $900 billion is a lot of money, there is no doubt about that. He said that is how much it would cost over a 10-year period. As we have all learned, that was a gimmicked-up number. It was fundamentally gimmicked up as a result of the fact that the cost of the bill where it begins to pay out money and will have real cost and the imple-mentation of the bill was delayed 4 years. So you take a 10-year window, and the bill is going to be out there for 6 of those 10 years, and you announce it is only going cost $900 billion. That is not the right question, is it. The right question for the American people to actually understand the im-pact of the legislation would be to ask how much it would cost over the first 10 years of full implementation. That is what you should be asking. We all know that the numbers have come in on that. Under the CBO estimate strictly adhering only to the insurance portion of the bill, I believe they came in as saying not $900 billion but $1,400 billion would be the cost over the first 10 years, but the true cost of the health care bill is yet higher still. A complete and honest assessment of the cost of the President’s health care bill would include a full 10 years of spending starting in 2014. Adding up CBO’s esti-mates for the different provisions in the bill, the President’s health care bill will amount to at least $2,600 billion— $2.6 trillion, not $900 billion. It is al-most three times the estimated costs over the true 10-year period. Now, that is how we go broke in this country. That is how this country is going broke. We go through a whole debate, and the President insisted that is how much the bill was going to cost. When the Democrats had a filibuster- proof majority in the Senate, they had 60 Democratic Senators, and they in-sisted it was going to pay for itself. They said there was more revenue than needed to pay for the cost of the bill, so don’t worry about it, be happy. On Christmas Eve, without amendments and after much secret debate and a bill plopped on the floor, the bill was voted up or down, 60 votes to 40. Every single Democrat voted for it, and every single Republican voted against it. I just have to say that the first 10 years of the bill is going to cost three times what was estimated. In addition to delaying the major spending provisions during the original window of the legislation, here are some of the other accounting gim-micks, tricks, and maneuvers that the drafters used to manipulate the score the Congressional Budget Office gave to the bill, to manipulate how much they would say the bill cost and to hide its impact. Well, one of the most significant things is a double-counted $400 billion. Can you imagine that? The U.S. Gov-ernment, according to the score manip-ulation and the way it was done by the CBO, utilizing complex rules of the CBO to its advantage, the way it was analyzed, they double-counted $400 bil-lion. So they cut Medicare expenses, they raised Medicare taxes, but they took the money and used it to fund the new bill and said they made Medicare more solvent. In some ways, we could argue they did make Medicare insol-vent because the money that was spent on the health care bill was borrowed from Medicare. They are debt instru-ments for Medicare. So my analysis of the legislation is that Medicare got a benefit, but there was no money for the health care bill. Yet they counted it as being $400 bil-lion free to be spent without adding to the debt of the United States, but it does add to the debt. Medicare is going broke. Medicare is going to call the debt from the United States. It in-creases the debt of the United States $400 billion. It was counted both places—as income from Medicare and income available to be spent on the health care provision. That is a stun-ning development. I got a letter from the head of the CBO the night before we voted, Decem-ber 23, and he said, in effect—not in ef-fect, I think this is a direct quote: It is double-counting the money, although the conventions of accounting might indicate otherwise. He told us in a letter before we voted that it was double-counting the money, but under the unified budget process rule that was utilized here, it didn’t score. In addition, they counted $70 billion of extra income that would come from the CLASS Act, which was designed for young people. The net result of that was that in the first decade or so of the CLASS Act’s implementation, healthy young people wouldn’t make many claims and there would be a surplus of $70 billion. But over 20, 30, 40 years, the CLASS Act goes into serious decline. Its actuarially unsound. It was referred to as a Ponzi scheme by the Demo-cratic budget chairman, Senator C ON- RAD. Finally, the Secretary of HHS could not certify it as a sound pro-gram, so $70 billion has been wiped off that as income available to be spent. They included—unrelated to this bill—student loan savings of $19 billion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4715 June 28, 2012 They relied on off-budget Social Secu- rity revenue for $29 billion, not scored toward the cost of the bill. They ignored the cost of imple- menting the law. Imagine that. I mean, you have a bill. How much is it going to cost? It is going to cost $900 billion. Well, do you not score the cost of it? What about all these IRS agents? There will be 1,000-plus to 2,000 IRS agents who have to be hired and paid for, which is $115 billion not counted in the cost of the bill. Is this why we are going broke in this country? We score a bill, say it only costs $900 billion, and we have $115 billion of administrative costs not even counted. Then there was no permanent solu- tion to the doctor reimbursement fig-ure. To pay the doctors at the rate they needed to be paid—and I agree they need to be paid at this rate— would cost $208 billion over the current level of expected spending. If we don’t have this doc fix, as we call it, doctors would receive a 20-plus percent cut in pay for doing Medicare work imme-diately. They are already paid less for Medicare work than they are paid for private insurance. Doctors would quit doing Medicare work if they took a 20- or 25-percent reduction in fee pay-ments. That is $200 billion. That was one of the main reasons we were sup-posed to have comprehensive health care reform, to deal permanently with this doctor fix that was being fixed every year, but not permanently. The bill didn’t do it. The bill never fixed it, therefore leaving a $208 billion hole in the plan that we have to find money for, and it is an essential part of all of that. So I would just say to my colleagues that this cost is unsustainable. It will put us on a debt course we cannot con-tinue to be on. We are going to con-tinue to look at the numbers, and I am going to ask people, if they desire, to come to the Senate floor and show me if I am wrong. Let me see where I am wrong. But I don’t think they can show that we are wrong because I and my staff are working as hard as we can to make sure what we say about the cost of this bill is accurate and fair. What does this do to the long-term debt of our country? That is a matter of great importance. One of the things our government does now is analyze the unfunded obligations of the U.S. Government. When we pass a law that says when everybody reaches a certain age, they get to draw a Social Security check of so much money, and it in-creases on a percentage basis each year, that is an obligation of the United States. That is an entitlement program, we call it. People are entitled to that whether the government has any money to pay it. So the health care bill is an entitle- ment. It has a guaranteed right for an individual American to receive certain subsidized health care benefits under this plan, and it is a permanent pro-gram, but it doesn’t have a permanent source of income dedicated to paying for it in any significant fashion. So it creates what the Congressional Budget Office refers to as an unfunded liabil-ity, unfunded obligations. To show Americans and Congress the true state of our long-term financial health, they do it over 75 years. It is not a perfect estimate, but it is a pretty good esti-mate of whether the programs are ac-tuarially sound and what they will do to the debt of America over 75 years. Under the numbers we have seen from the CBO and the work of our com-mittee, it is pretty clear the health care bill that was passed by this Con-gress will add $17 trillion to the un-funded liabilities of the United States of America—$17 trillion—not a little amount of money, a huge amount of money. To give perspective on how large it is, the Social Security un-funded liability over 75 years is only— only—$7 trillion. This is 2 1⁄2times as large an unfunded liability addition to our government as Social Security, and we are wondering how we are going to save Social Security. It is more than half of the unfunded liabilities of Medi-care or half of the unfunded liabilities of Medicare over 75 years. At a time when we have a serious demonstrated requirement that we re-duce the unfunded liabilities of Medi-care and Medicaid and Social Security, this bill would add $17 trillion to it. This is why every expert has told us this Nation is on an unsustainable course. The total unfunded liabilities before the passage of the health care bill were $65 trillion over 75 years. That trend, experts tell us, is unsustainable and threatens the future of our children and grandchildren. After the bill passes, it is $82 trillion. We don’t have the money to do health care reform in this way, with 2,700 pages and $17 tril-lion in additional cost to the Treasury. We don’t need to affirm and repass leg-islation that was said to cost $900 bil-lion in the first 10 years. In truth, in the first 10 years of its obligation—be-ginning the year after next—for the first 10 years it will cost almost three times that much—$2,600 billion. So it is a matter of great concern to me. As to the Court decision today, I am going to look at the Court decision and evaluate it. But I think it is additional proof that this health care legislation, from the beginning and in its en-tirety—a 2,700-page Rube Goldberg con-traption—will never work. It is further proof of that. Even the fundamental justification for the legislation that it was not a tax but a mandate has been rejected by the Court. The law was only upheld by say-ing it is not a mandate. In effect, it is a tax that the sponsors of the bill di-rectly said it was not. Indeed, the President said it was not a tax himself, directly. So certainly this opinion that allowed the legislation to stand, by the narrow margin of 5 to 4, in no way is an affirmation of the wisdom of the bill but is in fact demonstration that the people who cobbled it together and who rammed it through without full floor debate and amendments, that that scheme was flawed from the beginning and it will not work. Indeed, there are 1,700 references in that legislation to regulations to be issued by the Secretary of HHS. In other words, once the bill is passed, we will turn over huge sections of it to un-known bureaucrats who will issue regu-lations to administer this monstrosity. It is just not a practical and decent way to do business. So I believed the bill clearly violated the interstate commerce power granted to the Federal Government. The Fed-eral Government can only act and pass legislation if it has been specifically authorized by the Constitution. One of the authorized powers was to regulate interstate commerce. But if a person is sitting on the creek bank in Alabama, not buying insurance, not partici-pating, can he be made to buy a prod-uct in interstate commerce when he is explicitly not participating in that? I didn’t believe it could be done, and the Court agreed. The Court rejected the Obama administration’s argument that it did. They said the Federal Government has no power to compel a person to participate in a commercial market when a person doesn’t participate. If a person participates, maybe they can regulate it. But if a person doesn’t par-ticipate, they can’t tell a person to participate because this is a govern-ment of limited power. It was a historic and important rul- ing that the Supreme Court made clear: that there are limits to the power of the U.S. Government. I felt good about that. But now that Chief Justice Roberts and other members of the Court concluded that it may look like a mandate, but we call it a tax— and I haven’t done the technical anal-ysis they went through to reach their opinion, but that doesn’t seem correct to me. It seems as though it is still a mandate, a mandate to buy something a person doesn’t want to buy. That doesn’t sound like a tax to me. Maybe it is. Maybe they can defend it that way, but I don’t see how that is a tax. It sounds like a mandate and a penalty. So scholars will be reading that opin- ion for some time, and we will know whether Chief Justice Roberts an-nounces that this apparent mandate, apparent requirement that the Presi-dent said was not a tax, now it is a tax and the law is constitutional because of it. We will wrestle with that. But it does deal with the fundamental ques-tion: Can we afford this legislation. I say we cannot. I believe the facts are crystal clear that we cannot. We abso-lutely have to reform it, start over, create a health care system that works at a reasonable cost for the American people and does not burden our chil-dren with exorbitant debt that could throw us into a debt crisis at most any time, and in the long term destabilize the health of the Nation we love so much.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4716 June 28, 2012 FLOOD INSURANCE Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on June 20, I introduced a bill to authorize the FEMA administrator to waive the 30-day waiting period for flood insur-ance policies purchased for private properties affected by wildfire on Fed-eral lands. Senators T OMUDALL , MARK UDALL , and M ICHAEL BENNET are co- sponsors of this legislation. As we speak, wildfires are burning across the Western states and it is crit-ical that we take immediate steps to protect communities against the tragic consequences of flooding. To this end, I am pleased that the Senate included this legislation in the National Flood Insurance Program reauthorization bill, which we will be voting on later today or tomorrow. Flooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the United States. In 1968, Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program to help provide a means for property own-ers to financially protect themselves. The Act, however, requires a 30-day waiting period before coverage under a new contract for flood insurance can take effect. This is to prevent individ-uals from delaying until the last minute to purchase insurance when the risk of flooding is high. Unfortunately, today’s large cata- strophic wildfires in the West can alter the watershed conditions on our for-ested Federal lands so rapidly that nearby communities find themselves in flood hazard areas that didn’t exist the day before. The heat of the fires can make the ground impermeable to water, which significantly increases runoff when rainfall comes. In some cases, the U.S. Forest Serv- ice will advise a community to pur-chase flood insurance immediately after a wildfire is put out, only to see that community flooded by a few inches of rainfall weeks before the 30- day wait period has lapsed. When this happens, homeowners are tragically without any flood insurance coverage. Every year States throughout the U.S. deal with the devastating con-sequences of wildfires. Firefighters are currently battling several major fires in New Mexico, including the largest fire in the State’s history. Over 340,000 acres in the Gila and Lincoln National Forest have been burned and over 100,000 acres have been burned in Colo-rado leaving thousands of residents struggling to cope with the aftermath and the risk that flooding presents. While our immediate concern is fighting these wildfires, we need to take steps to protect communities against the tragic consequences of flooding. In fact, in the area of the Whitewater-Baldy Fire, though the damage from the fire is extensive, the damage caused to property and risk to life is expected to be far greater from the associated flooding despite the mitigation and prevention efforts in progress. Recently, I joined Secretary Vilsack and Forest Service Chief Tid-well for a briefing on the Little Bear Fire, and although progress is being made in containing the fire, people are very concerned that the monsoons will soon drop rain on soil that can’t absorb the moisture. It makes little sense to punish home- owners in communities who have not faced the kinds of flood risk they are currently presented due to the sudden devastation of nearby Federal forest land. I should also note that after con- sultation with the Congressional Budg-et Office, it is my understanding that this legislation does not score for budg-et purposes. I appreciate the Banking Committee’s willingness to work with us on this issue. This legislation rep-resents a critical step forward in pro-viding access to Federal flood insur-ance. The fire-stricken communities need help, and they need it now. SURFACE TRANSPORTATION Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am dis- mayed that the final conference report on the surface transportation reauthor-ization bill did not include funding and continued authorization for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, LWCF, program, despite the fact that this pro-vision was included in the Senate- passed bill. This short-sighted decision is counterproductive and ultimately, harmful to America. The LWCF program represents a promise that was made to the Amer-ican people almost 50 years ago to in-vest in conservation and outdoor recre-ation. The LWCF Program has long been a successful bipartisan program that has touched all 50 States and nearly every county in America. I strongly believe that the LWCF provi-sion, that was included in the Senate bill and which was passed in the Senate by a vote of 76 to 22, should have been included in the final conference report. Over the course of half a century, the LWCF program has protected natural resource lands, outdoor recreation op-portunities, and working forests across America. The program is so successful, in fact, that every part of the LWCF Program is oversubscribed, with the demand for State and local rec-reational needs, access for sportsmen, and working lands opportunities far ex-ceeding the funds that have been avail-able. The LWCF Program has been ex- tremely important to Vermont. Two successful Vermont examples are the Green Mountain National Forest and the Silvio O. Conte National Wildlife Refuge. Among the most visited lands in the National Forest System, the Green Mountain National Forest has provided accessible and affordable recreation for millions of residents in the densely populated Northeast. Like-wise, the Silvio O. Conte National Wildlife Refuge, which stretches across Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachu-setts, and Connecticut, is a revolu-tionary project that has helped to con-serve prime fish and wildlife habitat across the 7.2 million-acre Connecticut River watershed. By failing to include the LWCF Pro- gram in the final conference report, I believe that we are squandering a crit-ical opportunity to protect America’s precious natural resource lands and grow the economy. The Outdoor Indus-try Association estimates that outdoor recreation is an overlooked economic giant, generating $646 billion in direct consumer spending, supporting 6.1 mil-lion direct jobs, and producing $80 bil-lion in Federal, State, and local tax revenue each year. This amount dwarfs total spending in other sectors such as pharmaceuticals and motor vehicles, which respectively account for $331 bil-lion and $340 billion in direct spending. I am extremely disappointed that the final conference report did not include the bipartisan-supported LWCF Pro-gram. This will hurt all Americans today and for generations to come. I urge my colleagues to come together and right this wrong. The benefits of the LWCF Program are clear and we owe it to the American people to pro-vide funding for this essential and suc-cessful program. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ORDER OF BUSINESS Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sorry it has taken so long. There are a lot of things to do around here. The con-ference report has been filed. As I said earlier today, I appreciate very much the work of everyone, including our very hard-working staffs on both sides of the Capitol. But there is no need for us to wait anymore. We are not going to finish this tonight. We are going to have to come back tomorrow. I have talked to a number of people, and I wanted to make sure before any-thing was announced that the papers had been filed. They have been. We have a number of issues we are trying to work through procedurally. We are not going to be able to do that tonight. I am not passing blame on anyone, be-cause we all have a lot to do tomorrow, a lot of things that we are going to put on hold. This is a very big work period for us the next 10 days. I think it is ap-propriate to say we will be back at 10 o’clock in the morning to finish this legislation and do it as quickly as we can. We do not know what time the House is going to vote on this tomor-row, but we may have to wait now until they pass it. That is one of the pieces we are working on. We have done our very best to try to complete everything tonight, but we are not going to be able to do that. I am disappointed. I heard that from many people, how disappointed they are that we could not move further VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.059 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4717 June 28, 2012 down the road. But that is the way it is. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the leader yield for a question? Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished majority leader has been working very hard to accommo-date Senators in a vote. I know he has the support of every member of our caucus in doing that. I believe I heard the distinguished leader say we will come in at 10. Mr. REID. Yes. If I thought it would help to come in earlier, I would do that. But it would only be—— Mr. LEAHY. The Senator anticipated my next question. I appreciate that. Mr. REID. We likely cannot do any- thing until the House votes on the bill tomorrow. We are trying to work through that. I have to say, the House has been extremely cooperative in ev-erything we have done the last few days. I see on the floor my friend, the chairman of the Environment and Pub-lic Works Committee. She knows how hard this has been and how cooperative the Republicans have been. No one has been more so than the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, J IMINHOFE . I will always admire J IMINHOFE for the manner in which he approached this important piece of legislation. We pass out acco-lades on this floor, about everyone, how hard they work, but we would not be able to get this bill done except for J IMINHOFE . Fact. So I am disappointed we cannot do this tonight. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee just said, we would stay here tonight on our side until the wee hours of the morning, be-cause we have some things to do. I was scheduled to be in Lake Tahoe tomor-row, but I can’t be there. Other people have certainly more important trips than that. But it is one of the issues we have to face with these jobs we have, which are a tremendous privilege, but sometimes we do not have the ability, as a Governor does or the President does, a member of the Court does, to say: This is the schedule. There are 100 different leaders here, each thinking they have the best way of solving the problems of the world, and it takes a while sometimes to work through their opinions. f MORNING BUSINESS Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent that the Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL’S 150TH ANNIVERSARY Mr. DURBIN. I rise today to cele- brate a major milestone for Illinois and the nation. One hundred and fifty years ago on July 11, 1862, Illinois’ own Presi-dent Lincoln signed an Act of Congress that established the Rock Island Arse-nal. Rock Island started out during the Civil War as a small Union prisoner of war camp which also held and distrib-uted supplies. It has grown into a crit-ical manufacturer of 21st century sup-plies for our troops in the field. And in doing so, it also serves as the lifeblood of the Quad Cities region that hosts it. In celebration of its 150th anniver- sary, I would like to highlight Rock Is-land Arsenal’s impressive history and the impact it has had on the commu-nity and the nation. Rock Island has a long history of pro- ducing supplies for our military. It was rifle cartridges and siege howitzers in the Spanish-American War of 1898. In World War I, it was rifles and a variety of personal equipment. By World War II, the Arsenal’s emphasis had shifted to artillery production, and workers in-creased production from 75 artillery cartridges a year to 600 a month during the war. This ability to rise to the challenge for our servicemembers is a theme at Rock Island. Products weren’t the only thing changing at the Arsenal. So were de-mographics. Everyone is familiar with the image of Rosie the Riveter, as women stepped into the workforce. The Arsenal was no different—32 percent of the workforce was female during World War II. Yet some of the workers were only teenagers. Squeezing in 40 hours of work while going to school, students were picked up after class and bused to the island. They worked Saturdays too. In a not uncommon story, Arsenal worker Anna Mae said her wartime ef-fort was a family affair. ‘‘My mom worked on one side of the island, my stepdad on the other and I was in the middle.’’ Years after the war ended, Anna Mae returned to work at the Arsenal until retirement. When she learned that her war efforts contributed to her pension, she articulated the selflessness of so many when she said, ‘‘I never would have thought (about) that—we were just trying to win a war.’’ In the Korean War/Conflict, the sense of urgency on the island returned. Crews worked 10-hour days, 6 days a week, and sometimes on Sunday to get weapons and equipment shipped out. For Vietnam, the Arsenal created new products designed to counteract the Viet Cong’s guerilla ‘‘hit and run’’ tac-tics, such as the M102 lightweight how-itzer. The Arsenal continued to con-tribute to systems that meant life or death for the soldiers for the 1991 Gulf War—and then adapted as the military went through a drawdown after the war ended. But as we all know, that peace did not last long. A little more than 10 years ago, the attacks of September 11th changed our world—and the nation again found itself at war. Again to their credit, the Arsenal workforce went into overdrive to provide our troops what they needed. Machinist Jeff Roberts recalled, ‘‘Everyone’s mentality is it’s one collaborative ef-fort to get the soldiers what they need as fast as you can.’’ They did—in a unique way. The Arse- nal has the Department of Defense’s only vertically integrated metal manu-facturing capability. It has the only re-maining foundry in the U.S. Army. It means that raw materials can go in one side and come out the other as very in-tricate finished products. It does this with a number of materials, including stainless steel, carbon steels, and tita-nium. The result—new equipment to better protect our troops, especially on short notice. We all know how devastating impro- vised explosive devices (IEDs) were to U.S. troops in Iraq and continue to be to servicemembers in Afghanistan. In 2006 and 2007, our nation had fallen short in armor kits for Humvees and other ground vehicles to protect our troops. I urged then-Secretary Gates to use Rock Island’s production capability to get these kits to our troops faster. Secretary Gates agreed. Rock Island became the single largest producer of these armor kits. Talk about saving lives. Lieutenant General Raymond Mason, Army’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Logis-tics, recently noted, ‘‘It was critical that we had (the organic industrial base), along with our manufacturing capabilities at our arsenals at Watervliet, Rock Island and Pine Bluff. This allowed us to expand for wartime demand . . . ‘‘ He also added, ‘‘By en-suring we maintain a core level of work, we then retain expandability ca-pabilities if something else happens in the world.’’ As I look to the future, I would say that is exactly what we are doing at Rock Island. Earlier this year, I intro-duced the Army Arsenal Strategic Workload Enhancement Act of 2012, with the support of Senator M ARK KIRK, Senator G RASSLEY , Senator H AR- KIN, and the Senators from New York and Arkansas. The bill does just what General Mason was describing. It would create a strategic plan to ensure arsenals re-ceive the workload they need to keep workers’ skills sharp for whatever the future may hold. We worked with Senator L EVIN and Senator M CCAINon this. I was pleased that major portions of our bill were in-cluded in the report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act, which was voted out of the Armed Services Committee last month. But the Arsenal isn’t complacent. They are partnering with private in-dustry interested in working with tita-nium and other lightweight metals at the Quad-City Manufacturing Lab which opened in 2010. In these times of tough budget decisions, these partner-ships enable Rock Island to sustain itself at no cost to the government VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.062 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4718 June 28, 2012 through a Working Capital Fund. Just like the private sector, the Arsenal is out there competing for work—and winning it. They have signed agree-ments with Sivyer Steel, Mack Defense and others. But Rock Island is about more than just production—it is also the bedrock of the Quad-City region as the area’s largest employer. One example of fam-ily commitment to the Arsenal is Jeff Roberts, a machinist at Rock Island. His great-great-great-great grandfather was a master carpenter at Rock Island in the 1860s and helped build the is-land’s iconic Clock Tower. Working at the Arsenal for our men and women in uniform gave Jeff a clear under-standing of, as he described it, ‘‘what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.’’ He added, ‘‘I’ve never had the job satis-faction I have now until I came here.’’ Jeff’s experience is replicated all across the Arsenal. The island has more than 70 military and private sec-tor organizations as tenants. Over the years, the Arsenal has welcomed the Army Corps of Engineers, Army Sustainment Command, Joint Muni-tions Command, and Army Contracting Command, among others. Most re-cently, Rock Island welcomed the headquarters for First Army, which is in charge of mobilizing, training and deploying our Army Reservists. It may not always have the glitz of a front- page story. But their collective dedica-tion shows how central Rock Island is to the support of our military, every day. Rock Island Arsenal is a large and vi- brant installation, with a rich history and an impressive array of ongoing ac-tivities. Rock Island Arsenal has made remarkable contributions over the past 150 years. It has served us through our difficult times and will continue to do so in the future. I thank those who serve at the Arse- nal today and those who have served in the past. And also to those who have join me in honoring Rock Island Arse-nal in its 150-year anniversary celebra-tion. f INDEPENDENCE DAY 2012 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate our Na-tion’s Independence Day. Over 230 years ago, a collection of very brave and thoughtful men put their names and lives on the line to support a visionary idea, writing: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Today we honor those patriots who crafted our country’s identity, and we appreciate every man, woman, and child who has shared it, refined it, and lived it. There is a reason why the rest of the world looks to America as a bold leader, and it began in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776. It continues nationwide today in our independent spirit, our ambition, and our sense of generosity, and we certainly see that in my home State of Alaska. We see it in communities large and small, as we solve problems and work together to make life better and the fu-ture brighter. Today, we take a mo-ment to realize that we do all this without thinking about it—and that few other countries in the world can boast the same. But as we take a moment to appre- ciate all that we have, we must never forget the cost of freedom. Thousands have given their lives to secure the blessings of liberty. Men and women in uniform are serving bravely overseas, enduring tremendous sacrifice, while countless others guard our shores, pro-tect our interests abroad, and defend our skies here at home. Their burden is shared by the families who endure empty spots at the dinner table, missed birthdays, and absence from special moments like a child’s first steps. Freedom is indeed perishable and we are grateful for those who safeguard our liberty for our children and grand-children. As Americans, we honor our veterans and the freedoms they defend. We speak our minds and we think big thoughts—bounded only by the limits of our imagination. On this Independence Day, I am hon- ored to represent Alaska in the United States Senate. Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in the tradition of patriotic cele-bration to recognize 236 years of Amer-ican independence. The Fourth of July is not only a proud and inspiring sym-bol of our nation’s independence, but of our undeniable strength and unity. As we celebrate Independence Day this year, I am thankful for our forefathers’ struggle to afford us freedom and lib-erty which we enjoy today. As the first battles of the Revolu- tionary War broke out in April 1775, many colonists were skeptical of com-plete independence from Great Britain. By the middle of the following year, tensions and hostility were high. As revolutionary sentiment spread, so too did the colonists’ desire to become lib-erated from Great Britain. On July 2, 1776, the Continental Con- gress voted in favor of a resolution for independence. Two days later, our Founding Fathers adopted the Declara-tion of Independence, marking the United States’ break with Great Brit-ain. In 1870, the U.S. Congress insti-tuted July 4th as a federal holiday. As Americans, we are proud to celebrate this important national holiday, a symbol of our patriotism and freedom. On the eve of this celebration, we also pay tribute to today’s heroes; America’s brave men and women in uniform who have fought tirelessly to protect and preserve the very freedom afforded to us by our Founding Fa-thers. Their perseverance in the face of adversity is a testament to the strength of the greatest military in the world. We are proud to honor our vet-erans, active duty soldiers, and mili-tary families for their grave sacrifices made for the safety and security of this great nation. Next week, as we gather with family and friends, let us reflect on the trials and tribulations of our nation’s path to independence and the everlasting im-pact of this defining moment in Amer-ica’s history. With appreciation for the freedoms we enjoy today, I ask my col-leagues to join me in commemorating the birth of our Nation’s independence. f CONGRATULATING THE 2012 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to commend three outstanding Vermont companies that were recently singled out for recognition at the 2012 Fancy Food Show in Washington, D.C. These vendors were among the select 110 Sil-ver Finalists for the show’s coveted Specialty Outstanding Food Innova-tion, sofi, gold awards, widely consid-ered to be one of the top honors in the specialty food industry. The sofi Awards, from the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade (NASFT), recognize the best in specialty food and beverage and are a coveted industry honor. This year’s contest was the most competitive in the history of the awards, with a record 2,520 entries. Two of the vendors, Vermont Butter and Cheese Creamery, located in Websterville, and Big Picture Farm L3C, located in Townshend, won the gold sofi in their categories, while Grafton Village Cheese, located in Grafton, represented Vermont proudly as a finalist in the category for out-standing cheese or dairy products for their new cheese, Cave Aged Leyden. Vermont Butter and Cheese Cream- ery’s owners, Allison Hooper and Bob Reese, deserve well-earned congratula-tions for winning three gold sofi Awards, including Best Product Line, Best Cheese or Dairy Product for their aged goat cheese Bonne Bouche, and Best Perishable Food Service Product for their Sea Salt Crystal Cultured Butter. Allison and Bob’s extraor-dinary achievement demonstrates, be-yond a doubt, that Vermont Butter and Cheese Creamery has succeeded at building a high quality, superior brand that reflects the values and ethos of Vermont. Congratulations are due as well to Big Picture Farm’s owners, Louisa Conrad and Lucas Farrell, for winning a gold sofi Award in the Confectionary Category for their Farmstead Goat Milk Caramels. When I met this young couple last week, I was taken with their energy and excitement for both their goats and their award winning caramels. Earlier this year, Louisa and Lucas received a U.S. Department of Agriculture Value Added Producer Grant which helped them expand their farm, hire additional staff members, VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.028 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4719 June 28, 2012 and expand their business plan. The Value Added Producer Grant, together with Big Picture Farm’s hard work and commitment to their vision, helped to catapult this new business to a sofi Award after less than two years in business. That is quite an achievement. I can’t wait to see what challenges this young couple will tackle next. Recognition should go, too, to Bob Allen, Christine Damour, and Wendy Levy, co-owners of Grafton Village Cheese. This year, Grafton Village Cheese was a sofi finalist in the cat-egory of Outstanding Cheese or Dairy Products. Vermont Butter and Cheese Creamery also competed in this cat-egory and to have not one, but two great Vermont companies competing as finalists in the same category is an outstanding achievement for any State, much less one as small as Vermont. I always enjoy seeing Vermonters in Washington, and was pleased to visit them at the 2012 Fancy Food Show. These companies create Vermont jobs and grow Vermont’s economy. During these tough economic times, this kind of work is vital to restoring the Amer-ican way of life and getting the coun-try back on track. I am extremely proud of the hard work, dedication, en-trepreneurial spirit, and innovation of these exceptional Vermont companies. f NATIONAL PTSD AWARENESS DAY Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues today in recognizing the Department of Vet-erans Affairs’ National Center for Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, as their month-long PTSD awareness campaign comes to a close and in re-flecting on our participation in the third annual National PTSD Awareness Day. I thank Senator C ONRAD for intro- ducing the resolution to honor Army National Guard SSG Joe Biel who suf-fered from PTSD and tragically took his own life in April 2007 after return-ing from his second tour in Iraq. All this month, we draw attention to PTSD which affects millions of Ameri-cans at some point in their lives. As chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Af-fairs Committee, I am especially con-cerned with the impact that PTSD has had on our Nation’s servicemembers and veterans. The number of veterans treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, for PTSD or related symp-toms has reached 475,000 and there are likely more cases that go unreported, undiagnosed, or untreated each year. In fact, as the drawdown of Afghani-stan troops continues, we can only ex-pect those numbers to follow the steady rise previously reported. VA and the Department of Defense, DoD, need to be ready now. This unpreparedness is a tragedy. Whether the wounds they return home with are visible or invisible, no veteran should be left to face their injuries alone, and I am committed to seeing that they never have to. Already, we have seen a change in how VA and the DoD treat PTSD. Ear-lier this year, we learned that hundreds of servicemembers and veterans had their PTSD diagnoses reversed over the course of 5 years at Madigan Army Medical Center in my home State of Washington. In the wake of this shock-ing discovery, Secretary of the Army John McHugh ordered a comprehen-sive, Army-wide review of medical files from the past decade to uncover any other problems with misdiagnoses. Two weeks ago, Secretary Panetta an-nounced that he would be ordering a similar review across all of the armed services. I applaud these actions taken by Secretary Panetta and Secretary McHugh, but we are a long way from winning the battle on mental and be-havioral health conditions. That is why earlier this week I intro- duced the Mental Health ACCESS Act of 2012. This bill will require VA and DoD to offer a range of supplemental mental and behavioral health services to ensure that veterans, servicemem-bers, and their families are receiving the care that they need and deserve. The Mental Health ACCESS Act of 2012 provides for comprehensive standard-ized suicide prevention programs, ex-panded eligibility to families for sup-port services, improved training for healthcare providers, new peer-to-peer counseling opportunities, and reliable measures for mental health services. Finally, we must overcome the stig- ma that surrounds PTSD. As VA’s Na-tional Center for PTSD has dem-onstrated, once diagnosed, PTSD and its symptoms can be treated and those who suffer from it can resume healthy and productive lives. Efforts like Na-tional PTSD Awareness Day and PTSD Awareness Month are critical to com-bating some of the most damaging misperceptions about PTSD. In closing, as we look back on our ef- forts to raise awareness of PTSD throughout the month, we must also reaffirm our commitment to those vet-erans, servicemembers, and families af-fected by PTSD. Our veterans and serv-icemembers have made tremendous sacrifices for us and our country and we owe them the support and care that they deserve. f ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS RECOGNIZING EVANSTON ROUNDHOUSE AND RAIL YARDS ∑Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th an-niversary of the Evanston Roundhouse and Rail Yards. This impressive site, which is listed on the National Reg-ister of Historic Places, is a lasting landmark and a national treasure. Evanston is truly a special place, and the railroad has had a huge impact on its history. In fact, Evanston would not exist today had it not been for the rail-road. Like the rest of the area, a large part of Wyoming’s development de-pended on migrants coming from the East. Some traveled on famous emi-grant trails like the Oregon and Cali-fornia Trails. But many followed the train tracks as the transcontinental railroad forged a new path across the West. The transcontinental railroad had particular importance in Wyo-ming’s development. Steam engines needed water-refilling stations, and these stations quickly became hubs of commerce in the State. Evanston was the Union Pacific’s last stop in Wyo-ming, and its settlement depended on the railroad. In 1868, tracks finally reached Evans- ton, and a town of tents cropped up around the station. This prosperity was only short-lived because the managers soon ordered the station to be moved 12 miles west to Wasatch. Because of the transfer, the town’s population dis-appeared virtually overnight. Evanston was in danger of becoming another ‘‘end of the line’’ town. Fortunately, the station moved back to Evanston later that summer—and it stayed there. The railroad provided a stable job base and nearby coal mines encour-aged the settlement of the town. Just as the railroad depended on its work-ers, the town depended on the trains. Evanston enjoyed great success as a water-filling station. The increased production and prosperity of the Union Pacific warranted new facilities to ac-commodate its increased traffic. In 1871, a new roundhouse and a shop com-plex were constructed. The station was designated as the major Union Pacific maintenance facility between Green River, WY, and Ogden, UT. In the next 30 years, the station prospered and the town of Evanston expanded. In 1912, the Union Pacific approved additional up-grades. The construction included a new roundhouse, a state-of-the-art turntable, and electricity for the other buildings in the complex. Many technological advances eventu- ally caught up with the station’s suc-cess. The advent of diesel train engines brought the slow demise of the ma-chine shop in Evanston, as more and more services were moved to Green River. In 1927, main operations were moved to Green River and the Evans-ton station opened as a reclamation plant. Here, rolling train stock and parts were repaired and refurbished for the Union Pacific. The new designation created a new era of success for the station. At its height of production, the plant employed over 300 men, mak-ing it the largest employer in Evans-ton. The roundhouse and its accom-panying facilities were crucial to the economic independence of the town’s residents. The success of the reclamation plant was enjoyed for several decades. How-ever, in 1971, the Union Pacific closed the facility for good, due to modern production methods and lower prices for new equipment. The community had developed a strong tie to the rail-road. Evanston depended on the rail-road not only for jobs or economic sta-bility, but also for its identity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4720 June 28, 2012 its final closure, the Union Pacific do- nated the rail yards to the community, creating the perfect opportunity for the community to preserve the sta-tion’s legacy. Local businessmen formed a coalition to develop the area. The city of Evanston leased the facility to a number of railway companies while they created a comprehensive plan to preserve the roundhouse and rail yards. To honor and recognize the signifi- cant impact of the roundhouse and the railroad, community members turned their eyes to restoration and preserva-tion. This historic site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. This special designation prompted other city officials to create a plan for the preservation and renova-tion of the rail yards. In 1998, thanks to Federal funding and the fundraising ef-forts of the community, cleanup of the facilities began. The goal to preserve the structural and historical integrity of the facility was accomplished through the cooperation and passion of the entire community. Today, the Evanston Roundhouse and Rail Yards are open to the public. The recently dedicated J.T. & Phyllis Pat-terson Visitor Center welcomes visitors from across the country. In addition to the restoration of the original round-house, community leaders are working to restore the original turntable and other facilities around the plaza. Now, the machine shop is a clean, updated facility that is perfect for hosting events and meetings. And Evanston has a vision for what might follow. In the future, the city plans to move its city hall into the complex. Other ideas in-clude plans to install a renovated din-ing car and to move the original water tower from Wasatch to the rail yards. Evanston and its visitors will continue to enjoy the rich history of the round-house thanks to the innovation of city officials and Evanston’s partnership with local, State, and Federal agencies. The Evanston Roundhouse and Rail Yards is a remarkable part of Wyo-ming’s history. In honor of its 100th an-niversary, I invite my colleagues to visit this national treasure. This site is a visible reminder of the important role the railroad played in the growth and development of Evanston. I con-gratulate the citizens who have worked so hard to preserve the roundhouse. They should be proud to share this his-toric place with visitors from all over the world. ∑ f 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED WAY ∑MR. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate United Way for its com-mitment to serving people across the globe. For 125 years, United Way has been at the forefront of bringing about change in communities by initiating longlasting collaborative partnerships to meet the needs of citizens. By bring-ing together people, communities, and organizations, United Way has effec-tively solved problems and improved the lives of countless people. The vision of United Way has re- mained constant since 1887 when Den-ver, CO, community members recog-nized the importance of cooperation to address the welfare problems in the city. Those efforts laid the foundation for the help it provides to communities all over the world today. I am particularly proud of United Way’s efforts in Arkansas and the sup-port of people all over the State to help fellow Arkansans. I know many Arkan-sans join in efforts to help improve the well-being of their neighbors through various campaigns to mobilize re-sources and strengthen educational, employment, and health opportunities. We are blessed to have great commu-nity involvement and an organization like United Way that is always looking for new problems to solve. This is truly an amazing program that makes its presence count in untold by ways touching lives and creating lasting changes. On this 125th anniversary, on behalf of the people of Arkansas, I offer my thanks for impacting positive changes in the lives of people worldwide and close to home. I am humbled by United Way’s constant commitment and at-tention to developing a bright future for all citizens. It is a privilege to have United Way in our backyard, and we are grateful for its outreach. United Way serves as an inspiration for all of us, showing us what hard work, dedica-tion, and partnerships can lead to. Thank you for bringing hope to the hopeless, help to the helpless, voice to the voiceless and bridging the gaps be-tween people and resources. Congratu-lations on this great milestone. ∑ f MILTON, NORTH DAKOTA ∑Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community in North Dakota that will soon celebrate its 125th anniversary. On July 14th, 2012, the residents of Milton will recognize the community’s history and founding. When Milton was founded in 1887, the postmaster initially suggested that the town be called Springfield. Some histo-rians claim the town was named after the famous English poet, John Milton. However, most historians agree the town was named for Milton, Ontario, the hometown of pioneer settler Steven Sophar. Steven Sophar was instru-mental in obtaining land and creating townships across North Dakota, as well as in several other northern states. After establishing a post office, Milton reached its boom in population during the 1890s. The dedication of the residents keeps the community vibrant through its events and businesses. The local eleva-tor, Little Star Theater and Milton Cafe´are focal points in the commu- nity. Farming is also a thriving indus-try, due to the rich soil in the area. Organized by local residents, the city is celebrating its 125th anniversary on July 14. During the celebration, the Senior Center will highlight area busi-nesses, along with other community fa-vorites, with historic photos and dis-plays. Events will also include a pa-rade, a car/bike/tractor show, a com-munity dinner and program, a dance and fireworks sponsored by the Milton Fire Department. Mr. President, I ask the United States Senate to join me in congratu-lating Milton, ND, and its residents on their 125th anniversary and in wishing them a bright future. ∑ f GILBY, NORTH DAKOTA ∑Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community in North Dakota that will soon celebrate its 125th anniversary. On July 14, 2012, the town of Gilby will recognize their com-munity’s history and founding. Founded in 1887, Gilby was named for John Gilby Jr., who came to the area in 1878. The rich soil has made it pos-sible for farms to thrive in the area, growing wheat, soybeans, corn, sugar beets, and edible beans. The Scott farm, the oldest farm in Gilby, has been growing crops since the early 1800s. The Oppegard building has been a prominent landmark in Gilby since the town was established, starting out as a blacksmith’s shop. Currently, the Oppegard building is home to an inde-pendent repair shop serving the needs of farmers in the area. The people of this friendly town are predominantly from German heritage. To celebrate its 125th anniversary, Gilby is collaborating with Midway’s 50th All School reunion on July 12, and Forest River’s 125th anniversary on July 13. The activities culminate with Gilby’s 125 celebration on July 14. Events in Gilby will include a pie and ice cream social, a volleyball tour-nament, train rides, and a parade. I ask the United States Senate to join me in congratulating Gilby, ND, and its residents on the 125th anniver-sary of their founding and in wishing them a bright future. ∑ f CONGRATULATING NORMAN DIANDA ∑Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Mr. Norman ‘‘Norm’’ Dianda, who was recognized as the 2012 Reno Rodeo Parade Grand Marshal. My home State of Nevada is proud and privileged to acknowledge such an extraordinary civic leader. Since founding Q&D Construction in 1964, Norm has been committed to making the Truckee Meadows a great place to live. He has served as the heart and soul of the company by con-tinually going above and beyond the call of duty each year, assisting numer-ous organizations for the betterment of the Silver State. A native Nevadan, Norm has volun- teered his time to organizations such as the American Heart Association, American Lung Association, March of VerDate Mar 15 2010 01:20 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 4624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G28JN6.018 S28JNPT1smartinez on DSK7SPTVN1PROD with SENATE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4721 June 28, 2012 Dimes, American Cancer Society, the Boys & Girls Club of Truckee Meadows, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Saint Mary’s Hospital, and, of course, the Reno Rodeo Association. His extraordinary charitable work in the community is admirable. For 9 of the past 13 years, Norm was voted Contractor of the Year by his peers in northern Nevada. He truly is one of the best. Recently, Norm was honored with the privilege of leading the Reno Rodeo Parade. Having attended and supported the Reno Rodeo for over 60 years, Norm has seen and experienced many changes in the community and the rodeo itself. His company has been instrumental in updating the rodeo grounds for years. Norm’s love for Nevada, community service, and the Reno Rodeo are un-matched. Nevada’s economy relies on events such as the Reno Rodeo, which cele-brated its 93rd anniversary this year. Dependent upon nearly 400 volunteers from across the Truckee Meadows, the event is said to have an economic im-pact of $42 million in the Reno/Sparks area. This 10-day rodeo recognizes the passions and skills of some of the world’s top professional cowboys and cowgirls and their contributions to the sport of rodeo. I admire and recognize Norm’s com- mitment to northern Nevada. His dedi-cation serves as a constant reminder of the importance of giving back to our communities. I am proud to stand with the residents of my home State to rec-ognize his generosity and selflessness. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring a native Nevadan for all that he does for the Silver State. ∑ f 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED WAY ∑Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, today, on the 125th Anniversary of United Way of America, I wish to pay tribute to Nebraska’s many United Way orga-nizations. United Way is active in the communities of Beatrice, Columbus, Cozad, Crete, Fremont, Grand Island, Hastings, Kearney, Lexington, Lincoln, Nebraska City, Norfolk, North Platte, Omaha, Scottsbluff, Wayne, York, and others. The Nebraskans affiliated with these organizations work tirelessly every day to improve the lives of those around them. For the past 125 years, United Way has mobilized resources from local businesses and individuals to identify and meet the needs of the communities they serve. Thanks to the leadership from local United Way organizations, communities in Nebraska have been better able to address significant social issues. The programs they support help those experiencing hunger, domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse, ne-glect, and many more challenges. In Nebraska, the United Way provides leadership and helping hands through-out our State. I have had the privilege of working with United Way and the agencies they support as a county commissioner, city councilman, mayor, Governor, and now as a Member of the Senate. I have seen first hand the successes achieved by Nebraska’s United Way offices, which have improved the lives of countless citizens across the State. I couldn’t be more proud of their work. It is an honor to mark this special day by acknowledging United Way of-fices across our State and thanking the many volunteers who contribute time, talent, and financial resources to im-prove Nebraska communities. I wish all of the United Way offices in Nebraska and across the Nation another 125 years of success in their mission to serve oth-ers. ∑ f TRIBUTE TO RICK CRAIG ∑Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Rick Craig, president of America First Federal Credit Union. Rick was appointed president of the credit union in 1997, and previously served as the executive vice president for two decades. He recently announced his retirement and I wish to honor his exemplary career. Rick is an alumnus of Weber State University, where he earned a bachelor of science degree in the field of mathe-matics with a minor in physics. He went on to earn a master’s degree in the field of engineering from the Uni-versity of Utah, and graduated in 1981 from the Western Credit Union Na-tional Association, CUNA, Manage-ment School. While in school, Rick earned the Charlie Clark Award and later was honored with the James D. Likens Alumni Recognition Award. He has also completed the Credit Union Executives Society’s Directors Leader-ship Institute program at the London Business School. Over the years, Rick has been willing to share his knowledge with others, teaching courses at Weber State University and the Western CUNA Management School. Rick is a past board member of the Utah League of Credit Unions, and was vice chairman of the league’s Execu-tive Committee. From 1997 to 2003, he also served on the Governor’s Board of Credit Union Advisors in Utah. He served on the Filene Research Council from 1999 to 2005, and he has been a member of the CO-OP Board of Direc-tors since 2005. He has been a director of the Credit Union Executives Society, CUES, for 9 years, serving as chairman of the board. Rick was inducted into the Credit Union Society’s Hall of Fame in 1996. Mr. Craig has received numerous honors for his work. Utah Business Magazine recognized him as one of the one hundred most influential people in the State of Utah in 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2011. He was recognized as one of the Ten Trail Blazing Companies in Utah in 2003 and in 2004, the national CUES named him Executive of the Year. Under his leadership, America First Credit Union was recognized as one of the best places to work in Utah in 2007. Craig has written numerous articles, including articles for CUNA and CUES magazines, as well as computer world. After 12 years as president, Rick Craig is leaving America First Credit Union on solid financial foundation. He has been successful at navigating the credit union through very turbulent fi-nancial times. Although Rick Craig has achieved great success in business, his greatest success has been being the father of 10 wonderful children. It is my wish that he and Karen enjoy this new chapter in their lives. ∑ f REMEMBERING JUDGE ROBERT C. BOOCHEVER ∑Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, next week the Juneau community will come together to honor the late Judge Robert C. Boochever, who passed away on October 9, 2011. At the time of his passing, Judge Boochever was a senior judge of the Ninth Circuit, U.S. Court of Appeals. Since Alaska was admitted to statehood, only three Alaskans have served on that court. Judge Boochever was the first of the three. Judge Boochever was not born in Alaska, but he earned the right to be called an Alaskan through decades of service, on and off the bench, to our community. Robert C. Boochever was born in New York City on October 2, 1917, and grew up in Ithaca, the home of Cornell University where his father was director of public relations. He completed his undergraduate work and law degree at Cornell, then enlisted in the Army. Deployed to Newfoundland as a legal officer, he met Connie Mad-dox, who was the chief surgical nurse for the base. They were married in April 1943. At the end of the war, a long-time family friend from Cornell, Warren Caro, who had been an aide to Alaska’s territorial Governor, Ernest Gruening, told Judge Boochever about a job in Juneau. It was an assistant U.S. attor-ney position, but at the time there was no U.S. attorney, so Boochever would in fact be running the operation. At the time, Judge Boochever knew noth-ing of Alaska or Juneau other than the praises sung by his family friend, War-ren Caro. But that didn’t stop him from asking Alaska’s delegate to Con-gress, Bob Bartlett, for a recommenda-tion. Once offered the job, he persuaded Connie to give Alaska a try and they never looked back. In 1947, Boochever joined the Faulk- ner Banfield law office in Juneau and soon was made a named partner. He built the Faulkner Banfield firm, which dates back to 1914, into one of Alaska’s great law firms. That firm continues to operate today as Faulkner Banfield in Juneau and Holmes, Weddle and Barcott with offices in Anchorage, Seattle, Portland and San Diego. Mike Holmes, one of his partners, described Boochever as ‘‘the best trial lawyer in the State.’’ He served as president of both the Alaska and Juneau Bar Asso-ciations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4722 June 28, 2012 In 1972, Judge Boochever was named to the Alaska Supreme Court and served as chief justice for three years. In 1980, President Carter nominated Judge Boochever to the Ninth Circuit. In an oral history, Judge Boochever de-scribed himself as a champion of indi-vidual rights who was also sympathetic to the problems of law enforcement. His Ninth Circuit colleague, Judge Dorothy Wright Nelson, the former dean of the University of Southern California Law School, described Boochever as the best writer on the court. But a distinguished legal career was but one measure of this outstanding Alaskan. Judge Boochever was a gen-tleman who greeted women with the tip of a hat, a family man whose daughter would sing out loud, ‘‘Oh, we’re the happy Boochevers’’ to the tune of ‘‘Jolly Good Fellow,’’ an avid birdwatcher, a poet, a singer and a pi-anist. According to a 1997 tribute in the Alaska Bar Rag, he was ‘‘revered by his friends and neighbors as a dedicated advocate who championed causes that helped shape the Juneau community.’’ He was the first chairman of the Ju- neau Planning Commission, a vocal op-ponent of efforts to move Alaska’s cap-ital out of Juneau, and a leader in the successful campaign to create the Uni-versity of Alaska Southeast in Auke Bay. Judge Boochever, and Connie, who predeceased him, were selected by the Juneau Rotary Club as Man and Woman of the Year. Connie will long be remembered as a champion of the arts in Juneau. What an outstanding team. Outstanding families are the product of outstanding patriarchs. Judge Boochever was the father of four out-standing daughters. Barbara, an avid skier, whose daughter Hillary Lindh, would grow up to be an Olympic silver medalist in downhill skiing; Linda, an Anchorage businesswoman; Mimi, a teacher nationally renowned for teach-ing the fine arts to young people; and Ann, a music teacher who cofounded two of Juneau’s finest restaurants. Judge Boochever was outstanding in every respect. It is people like Judge Boochever who moved Alaska from the last frontier of the prestatehood period to the best place in America to live, work and raise a family. I am grateful for his significant contributions to the quality of life we today enjoy in the State of Alaska. That is why I was proud to cosponsor legislation naming the Juneau Federal courthouse in per-petuity for Judge Boochever. That is why I am proud to honor his life and legacy today. ∑ f RECOGNIZING THE ASPEN CENTER FOR PHYSICS ∑Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Presi- dent, today I wish to congratulate the distinguished Aspen Center for Phys-ics, located in Aspen, CO, on the occa-sion of its 50th anniversary. I offer these congratulations on behalf of Sen-ator B ENNET of Colorado as well. We would like to commend the Aspen Center for Physics for their dedication and excellence in the field of theo-retical physics. Since the 1960s the Cen-ter has been one of the world’s fore-most research centers for the pursuit of basic scientific understanding on topics ranging from cosmology to bio-physics. With Federal funding primarily from the National Science Foundation and the support of dozens of corporate, in-stitutional, and individual sponsors, the Aspen Center for Physics has be-come an international hub for revolu-tionary physics research. More than 10,000 scientists, representing 65 coun-tries and including 52 Nobel Laureates, have participated in Center programs. They come to Aspen to converse with their peers, conduct groundbreaking research, and explore uncharted areas in theoretical physics. The atmosphere created by the Aspen Center for Physics is unique. While sur-rounded by beautiful landscapes, re-searchers are encouraged to participate in informal dialogue and pursue cre-ative and novel paths in their research, both individually and in collaborative groups. The unstructured environment has been key to the exchange of ideas among the world’s best theoretical physicists, and it has led to impressive results: more than 10,000 scientific pa-pers and books have cited the Center’s influence. The Center is also a good neighbor. For more than 25 years, the Center has offered free public lectures on cutting- edge science to the community. It of-fers informative and interactive pro-grams designed to engage children in learning and get them excited about science. Physicists from the Center also visit local schools and serve as mentors for students. Colorado is fortunate to be home to the Aspen Center for Physics. Senator B ENNET and I would like to congratu- late them for an impressive first 50 years and wish them continued success for the next 50 years. ∑ f MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to the Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries. f EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate messages from the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate committees.

A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to provide social services agencies with the resources to provide services to meet the unique needs of the Holocaust survivors to age in place with dignity, comfort, secu-rity, and quality of life; to the Com-mittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senators K IRKand M IKULSKI to introduce the Responding to Urgent needs of Sur-vivors of the Holocaust Act or the RUSH Act. Our bill will provide needed protec- tions for survivors of the Holocaust who managed to make it to the United States after years of prolonged terror, abuse, and desperation. Millions fled from the cruelty of the Nazi regime be-tween 1933 and 1945, from territories annexed, invaded or occupied by Nazi Germany and from their Axis partner countries in Europe as well. Millions of others were killed during the Holocaust, exterminated by a ruth-less machine propagated by the Nazi party. Those who escaped the terror of the Nazi regime carried with them ex-periences that can never be forgotten, and have adversely affected their abil-ity to cope with institutionalized set-tings. Many Holocaust survivors living in the United States would prefer to spend their days at home with their families, rather than being moved into settings where they lose autonomy, privacy, and control, which can bring back painful trauma from their experi-ences under Nazi rule. This bill would amend the Older Americans Act to en-sure that Holocaust survivors can bet-ter access needed services, such as health care and nutrition services, without having to live in a nursing or assisted living facility. As of 2010, there were approximately 127,000 Holocaust survivors living in the United States, and more than three quarters of them are over age 75, with a majority in their 80s and 90s. By fo-cusing on home and community-based long-term care, we can help ensure that fewer survivors are dependent on the unpaid support of family care- givers, or have to resort to unnecessary institutionalization. All aging Americans deserve access to needed community supports and services in comfortable settings that are neither mentally nor physically traumatizing. These great Americans deserve our efforts to ensure that they are better able to age in place.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4727 June 28, 2012 York and a general in the New York Militia, led the successful defense of Fort Erie in the late summer of 1814, which lifted the sprits of the people of the United States at an im-portant time and resulted in Brown emerg-ing from the war a national hero; Whereas the British plan to invade from the North, in a manner similar to that of General John Burgoyne in 1777, was halted at Plattsburgh, New York in September 1814; Whereas the victory at Plattsburgh shat- tered any hopes of British gains in the North, helped maintain national morale after Washington was sacked in that dark summer of 1814, and was described by Win-ston Churchill as the ‘‘most decisive engage-ment of the war’’; Whereas from the death and destruction of the War of 1812 there was born a spirit of co-operation and a vision of peace between the United States and Canada; Whereas the unparalleled cooperation, prosperity, and friendship that developed be-tween the United States and Canada since the War of 1812 find the deepest roots and daily expressions in the border communities across upstate New York, which was the front line of the War of 1812; Whereas the bicentennial of the War of 1812 offers an exceptional opportunity to ac-knowledge and celebrate the true and lasting legacy of 200 years of peace between the United States and Canada; and Whereas through the turmoil of war, a young nation endured and saw its banner continue to wave over a land free and brave: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812. f SENATE RESOLUTION 514—COM- MEMORATING THE VICTORY OF LOYOLA UNIVERSITY MARYLAND IN THE 2012 NCAA DIVISION I MEN’S LACROSSE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. M I- KULSKI ) submitted the following resolu- tion; which was considered and agreed to: S.

Brian Linnane, S.J. and Jim Paquette, Loyola University’s President and Athletic Director, respectively, were instrumental in bringing academic and athletic success, as well as national recognition, to Loyola Uni-versity Maryland; and Whereas the 2012 Loyola University Mary- land men’s lacrosse team has brought great honor and pride to their university, the State of Maryland, and the United States: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) congratulates the Loyola University Maryland Greyhounds for winning the 2012 NCAA Division I Men’s Lacrosse National Championship; (2) recognizes the achievements of the players, coaches, students, and staff whose hard work and dedication were key to Loyola’s victory in the championship game; and (3) requests the Secretary of the Senate to transmit for appropriate display an enrolled copy of this resolution to Loyola University President Rev.

R ES. 515 Whereas approximately 220,000 Catholic Sisters have served in the United States be-ginning even before the Nation’s founding; Whereas approximately 57,000 Catholic Sis- ters serve in the United States today; Whereas Catholic Sisters are women who dedicate their lives to God by serving God’s people, especially the poor, the sick, and the marginalized; Whereas, fortified by a deep faith in God and an unwavering commitment to the com-mon good, American nuns built the Catholic Church in the United States through their ministry to the vulnerable, the sick, and the poor; Whereas individuals trained by the Catho- lic Sisters serve as health providers in com-munities across the Nation; Whereas Catholic hospitals treated ap- proximately one in 6 patients in the United States; Whereas Catholic Sisters helped establish the Nation’s largest private school system and founded more than 150 colleges and uni-versities and educated millions of young peo-ple in the United States; Whereas, since 1980, 9 Catholic Sisters from the United States have been martyred while working for social justice and human rights overseas; Whereas Catholic Sisters who have an- swered the call of the Second Vatican Coun-cil to seek ‘‘justice in the world’’ continue the vital mission of teaching our children in schools, healing the sick in hospitals, feed-ing the hungry, sheltering the homeless, ad-ministering major institutions, encouraging corporate responsibility, and advocating for public policies that honor human dignity; and Whereas the congregations of women reli- gious, along with their respective organiza-tions, make the United States stronger and deserve our deepest appreciation: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) recognizes and commends the Catholic Sisters of the United States, whose inspiring legacy of service enriches the Nation; (2) honors the contributions of Catholic Sisters to the Nation; and (3) stands in solidarity with Catholic Sis- ters in their work toward a more just society for all of God’s people. f AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED SA 2488.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to S. Res. 514. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title. The legislative clerk read as follows. A resolution, (S. Res. 514) commemorating the victory of Loyola University Maryland in the 2012 NCAA Division I Men’s Lacrosse National Championship. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and commemorate Loyola University of Maryland’s vic-tory in the 2012 NCAA Men’s Lacrosse Championship and to honor the play-ers, coaches, and administrators who helped to secure Loyola’s first Division I National Championship. For much of recent history, NCAA Division I Lacrosse has been dominated by a small group of eight, elite pro-grams. But last month, a Jesuit uni-versity on Charles Street in downtown Baltimore became the smallest school ever to win a Division I National Championship. Loyola joins the ranks of such universities as Johns Hopkins University, the University of Mary-land, Syracuse, and Cornell, in becom-ing just the ninth team to win a cham-pionship since the event’s creation in 1971. This year’s Division I National Championship set the stage for an afternoon of record-shattering lacrosse. The Greyhound defense and goalkeeper Jack Runkel set a new NCAA Division I record for fewest goals allowed in a national championship game, giving up only three goals despite a barrage of nearly thirty shots taken by the highly motivated University of Maryland of-fense. Loyola University’s star offensive player, Eric Lusby, had a busy day as well. He scored four goals in the cham-pionship game, bringing his total to 17 during the final four games of the sea-son, setting a new NCAA tournament record. He also broke Loyola’s single season scoring record with a total of 54 goals. Loyola University players were not the only ones to break records last month. Head Coach Charley Toomey became the first coach ever to win an NCAA title on his first trip to the NCAA tournament. With 18 wins and only one loss, the players and coaches of the 2012 Greyhounds lacrosse team have firmly cemented themselves as the most successful team in Loyola’s history. The team’s achievements are even more impressive when you con-sider that the Greyhounds started the season as an unranked team. Lacrosse has long played a central role in the athletic culture of Mary-land, and I am proud to see that this year’s All-Tournament Team selec-tions reflect this reality. Eight of the ten players selected to receive All- Tournament honors call Maryland home, with five coming from the Loy-ola Greyhounds team and three from the University of Maryland. With Loyola’s victory in this year’s cham-pionship, Maryland is now home to three of the nine teams that have ever won a national championship, further securing our State’s reputation as the center of collegiate lacrosse. In light of these impressive accom- plishments, I call upon my colleagues to join me in recognizing and congratu-lating Loyola University’s players, Coach Charley Toomey, Athletic Direc- tor Jim Paquette, and President, the Rev. Brian Linnane, S.J. on a cham-pionship season and the many amazing achievements that carried the Grey-hounds to victory. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan- imous consent the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the mo-tions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or de-bate, and any statements be printed in the R ECORD . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The resolution (S. Res. 514) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to. The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows: S. R ES. 514 Whereas on May 28, 2012, Loyola University Maryland won its first NCAA Division I Men’s Lacrosse National Championship and the first Division I national title in the his-tory of the school; Whereas Loyola is the smallest school in NCAA history to win the Division I Men’s Lacrosse National Championship, with only 3,863 undergraduate students; Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds finished the men’s lacrosse season with a record of 18 wins and 1 loss; Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds set a NCAA record for the fewest goals allowed during a men’s lacrosse championship game; Whereas 5 members of the Loyola Grey- hounds, Joe Fletcher, Josh Hawkins, Eric Lusby, Scott Ratliff, and Jack Runkel, were named members of the All-Tournament team; Whereas Loyola senior Eric Lusby was named the Most Outstanding Player of the 2012 NCAA Division I Men’s Lacrosse Na-tional Championship after scoring 4 goals in the title game, while also setting a tour-nament record with a total of 17 goals in 4 games; Whereas sophomore goalie Jack Runkel had 6 saves in the championship game, hold-ing the University of Maryland to only 3 goals; Whereas the 18 wins by the Loyola Grey- hounds this season set a program record; Whereas Loyola became just the ninth team to win an NCAA Division I Men’s La-crosse National Championship since the first championship was held in 1971; Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds secured their victory in only their second appearance in a national championship, having been de-feated by Syracuse in 1990; Whereas the vision and leadership of the Rev.

LAURA RICHARDSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 26, 2012 Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1447, the Aviation Security Stakeholder Participation Act of 2011, which amongst other things amends title 49 of the United States Code to direct the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transpor- tation Security Administration) to establish an Aviation Security Advisory Committee (ASAC). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established the ASAC in 1989 following the bombing of Pan American World Airways Flight 103. When the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was established, the sponsorship of the ASAC transferred to TSA. Despite significant contributions to TSA policy-making, particularly with respect to air cargo security, and strong support from aviation se-curity stakeholders who participated in the ASAC, TSA allowed the ASAC’s charter to ex-pire. H.R. 1447 provides for the establishment of an ASAC to assist and make recommenda-tions to the TSA Assistant Secretary on avia-tion security matters, including the develop-ment and implementation of policies, pro-grams, rulemaking, and security directives per-taining to aviation security. Within the Advisory Committee are three subcommittees: (1) an air cargo security working group, (2) a general aviation working group, and (3) an airport pe-rimeter security working group. U.S. and industry stakeholders have ex- pressed frustration about the level of dialogue with TSA about the threat of potential attacks. The lack of communication between TSA and stakeholders makes our aviation industry vul-nerable to threats such as Yemen insurgents shipping explosive devices on our passenger and cargo airplanes. H.R. 1447 provides us with the tools to reopen these lines of commu-nication between air carriers to aircraft manu-facturers from aviation technology security in-dustries to labor organizations. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Com- mittee on Homeland Security, I fought for and strongly supported legislation that protects our homeland and our people. I will continue to support legislation that enables us to stay ahead of any potential threat. That is why I support H.R. 1447, the Aviation Security Stakeholder Participation Act of 2011, and urge my colleagues to do likewise. HONORING MR. LEONARD ATTMAN HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER OF MARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today to honor Mr. Leonard Attman and Mrs. Phyllis Attman for their lifelong com-mitment to making a difference in the lives of those less fortunate. We recognize their gen-erosity as the Board Room of Sinai Hospital in Baltimore is named in their honor. In Baltimore, the Attman name is synony- mous with ‘‘charity.’’ Over the years, Mr. and Mrs. Attman have worked hard to make a dif-ference in the community through countless philanthropic efforts. In the past, they have made generous donations to support medical research, including groundbreaking studies on breast cancer and brain tumors. Their efforts have brought much-needed support to fields that are often overlooked or are in greater need of further understanding. In addition to serving as a board member at Sinai and Northwest Hospitals, Mr. Attman’s involvement in professional, civic and philan-thropic organizations includes membership on the boards of Shosana S. Cardin High School and Beth Tfiloh Brotherhood, as well as the Board ofDirectors of the Reginald F. Lewis Museum and the Signal 13 Foundation for the Baltimore City Police Department. He actively participates in the activities of many other or-ganizations including the Advisory Board for the Shock Trauma Unit at the University of Maryland Medical Systems. A longtime business leader, Mr. Attman has more than four decades of experience in resi-dential and commercial real estate develop-ment. Mr. Attman was also the founder and serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Future Care, which manages nine nursing home facilities serving more than 1,300 pa-tients and providing employment to more than 1,500 workers. In all of their business endeavors, the Attmans have always focused on family first. Mr. Attman humbly considers his employees not as subordinates, but as ‘‘coworkers.’’ He has worked to do whatever possible to avoid layoffs during the unsteady economic times in recent years. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join with me today to honor Mr. Leonard and Mrs. Phyllis Attman. Their compassion and dedication to the Baltimore community and Sinai Hospital is an inspiration to us all. It is with great pride that I congratulate them on their exemplary service to their community and our country and wish them many more years of success. IN RECOGNITION OF DAN BOLLINGER, SR. HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Dan Bollinger, Sr. as he retires after over thirty years of illus-trious service as an executive of regional de-velopment organizations in Georgia. A cele-bration will be held in his honor on Thursday, June 28, 2012 at the Camilla Depot in Camilla, Georgia at 5:30 p.m. Mr. Bollinger, a native of Missouri, was raised in a small town of 600 people. He grad-uated from the University of Missouri—Colum-bia with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science. He also pursued a higher level of education in the field of Community and Eco-nomic Development. A strong leader with an exceptional work ethic, Mr. Bollinger is currently the Executive Director of Southwest Georgia Regional Com-mission, a planning agency that serves 14 Georgia counties including Baker, Calhoun, Colquitt, Decatur, Dougherty, Early, Grady, Lee, Miller, Mitchell, Seminole, Terrell, Thom-as, and Worth. The SWGRC is responsible for assisting local governments with comprehen-sive planning in land and economic develop-ment. Mr. Bollinger has held the position of Executive Director since 1994. I. the past, Mr. Bollinger has also served as president of the National Association of Devel-opment Organizations and of the Georgia As-sociation of Regional Development Centers as well as serving as Executive Director of the Missouri Bootheel Regional Planning and Eco-nomic Development Commission for 11 years. Additionally, he was vice president of the Bank of Chaffee in Missouri. Mr. Bollinger also served our country for four years in the United States Air Force. He volunteered as president of the Chaffee, Mis-souri Chamber of Commerce for two terms. Additionally, he umpired baseball and fast pitch softball and refereed basketball for 25 years on the amateur level. Since moving to Georgia, he has become an avid tennis player and golfer. George Washington Carver once said, ‘‘How far you go in life depends on your being ten-der with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and toler-ant of the weak and strong because someday in your life you will have been all of these.’’ As a leader, Mr. Bollinger recognized the impor-tance of serving others. It cannot be disputed that Dan Bollinger, Sr. has achieved numerous successes in his life. However, none of this would have been pos-sible without the enduring love and support of his loving wife, Lynn, and wonderful children and grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Mr. Bollinger for his out-standing professional achievements and his dedicated service to Southwest Georgia.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1168 June 28, 2012 TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF DR. WENDY WAYNE HON. JIM COSTA OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute ute to the life of Dr. Wendy Wayne who passed away on June 17, 2012 at the age of 64 after fighting a courageous four year battle with non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Wendy was a loving wife and mother, a committed ac-tivist and respected community leader who touched the lives of many. A proud product of Culver City, California, Wendy was born on February 4, 1948. She at-tended Hamilton High School in Los Angeles and graduated from the University of Los An-geles (UCLA) before joining the Peace Corps and serving in Kenya. She married the love of her life, Gene Tackett, after traveling around the world and then working on Gene’s first po-litical campaign for Kern County Supervisor. Wendy quickly became an icon and a source of inspiration within the local community. Wendy and Gene started their family in Ba-kersfield in 1978 and have worked continu-ously to improve the quality of life of all fami-lies in Kern County, the place they called home. Through her leadership and hard work, Wendy became a role model for her friends and neighbors. Dr. Wendy Wayne exemplified the true meaning of being an advocate. After working at Clinica Sierra Vista and obtaining a nursing degree at California State University (CSUB), she worked as a nurse at Kern Med-ical Center (KMC). She continued her volun-teer activities promoting child safety seats and expanded childcare opportunities for working mothers. Both of her sons were born in the KMC Birthing Center organized by Wendy. In 1986, Wendy started her career with the Kern County Superintendent of School’s office as an advocate for expanded preschool edu-cation. Working with community leaders she helped create the Community Connection for Childcare and became its first director. She later became the executive director of Kern County’s First Five organization, an agency promoting child education during their first five years of age. For more than 36 years, she was a committed and reliable member of the community. Over the years, Wendy continued to fulfill her wanderlust for travel and doing good works with a three month health project in Kenya, Bakersfield Sister City trips, Rotary polio ratification trips to India and Nigeria, working with her niece Ann Reiner in the Sudan and Uganda. Her family vacations in-cluded a revisit to her Kenyan village where she had once taught biology. Remarkably, Wendy endured countless hours of travel to receive advanced cancer treatment in South-ern California while simultaneously serving as a consultant to San Joaquin Hospital to de-velop a much needed state of the art cancer center in Bakersfield. Her work demonstrated her dedication to fostering and preserving the health and safety of children throughout the world, and her compassion and concern for our community served as a testament to her extraordinary character. Wendy lived an exemplary life and will un- doubtedly be missed by many. The true loves of her life were husband, Gene; sons, Larkin and Benji; daughters-in-law Katie and Amy; and grandchildren Maya, Lola and Ben. A principled and engaged citizen, Wendy Wayne participated in every aspect of commu-nity life. She led a generous and energetic life filled with love and adventure. Her long-lasting participation in our community and commit-ment to the well-being of future generations will ensure that her legacy lives on for years to come. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Dr. Wendy Wayne, a beloved wife, mother, leader and true champion for all people. f INDEPENDENCE DAY IN HONOR OF OUR ARMED FORCES AND THEIR FAMILIES HON. JEAN SCHMIDT OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mrs. SCHMIDT. Mr. Speaker, in honor and in remembrance of all of our Armed Forces and their families on this Independence Day, who are fighting and have fallen, and are re-covering from the scars of war. I ask that this poem penned by Albert Caswell be placed in the R ECORD . INDEPENDENCE DAY Independence . . . Remembering our Forefathers Declaration of Independence, they! Remember to so kneel and pray! For all of those, and they . . . who now so fight so far away! And what they so give, so gave! As we so awake . . . All in the happiness and that glory of this day! That which freedom does so all of us so bathe! All on this holiday! Our Nation’s Birthday! As that old Red, White and Blue so waves! All in our Independence that they so give, that they so gave! For all of those magnificents, who now so lie in such cold dark quiet graves! Whose families great pain shall not ever so wave! ‘‘Oh say can you see’’ on this day! ‘‘By the dawn’s early light’’, all of those soft cold quiet graves! As you so wipe your tears away! This Independence Day! Remember all of those and they, who are without their families, gone! And all of those who come home from war, without arms and legs who must now so cou- rageously live on! To teach us where courage is born! And all of those with the unseen scars of war, that which now so form! All over there, where the battle now so rages on! ‘‘With the bombs bursting in air’’. . . ‘‘And the rockets red glare!’’ Which gives proof through the night, of that courage they wear! Who all for us so fight, and so die over there! As this Independence Day, as you hold your families oh so very close! And all of those picnics and family gath- erings you so host! And so watch those fire works, explode! Remember the grave cost and toll of all of those living so close! And selfless sacrifice that which they fine hearts so host! All for us who so pay the most! God Bless Them All! This Independence Day, remember what they give and gave! Let us we pray! Amen! f WALL STREET JOURNAL RECOG- NIZES BOUDIN CAPITAL OF THE WORLD HON. CHARLES W. BOUSTANY, JR. OF LOUISIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the article on the front page of the Wall Street Journal this morning recog-nizing the fantastic food and culture in my South Louisiana. I invite any of my colleagues to travel with me to Louisiana to enjoy the fantastic boudin and Cajun culture that comprises our proud heritage in South Louisiana. All along South Louisiana we enjoy the best homemade Cajun boudin, zydeco music, and Cajun charm that is truly unique to the United States. Today, the Wall Street Journal recognized this vibrancy in its article titled ‘‘Cajun Towns Feud About Sausage With Links to the Past.’’ To com-memorate this fact, I include the article, written by Timothy W. Martin, into the C ONGRESSIONAL RECORD in its entirety here: SCOTT, LA.—Few would dispute that south- ern Louisiana is boudin heaven. The local version is a sausage made of pork, rice and various seasonings. Trickier to answer is which of three competing Cajun commu-nities is its official mecca. In April, Louisiana’s state legislature be- stowed the coveted mantle of Boudin Capital of the World on Scott, a bustling town of 8,600 on Interstate 10—the busy east-west highway linking Houston and New Orleans. It churns out 1.3 million pounds of the sau-sage a year. ‘‘No one comes close’’ to Scott’s sausage output, boasts Mayor Purvis J. Morrison, who lobbied hard for the title, plying law-makers with industry statistics to make his case. UPS trucks collect boudin (pronounced: Boo-DAN, while swallowing the N) shipments here twice a day, he says. Sales help stuff city coffers. ‘‘If you like hot, you’ll get hot. If you want mild, you’ll find mild. We have boudin balls as big as a softball. We have smoked boudin. I don’t even know if anybody did it before we did it,’’ he says. But Scott’s new title—which it uses for marketing purposes—has left a bad taste in the mouths of residents of Broussard, 12 miles to the southeast. They insist their town, population 7,600, is the Boudin Capital of the World—a title they say lawmakers gave them in the late 1970s. True, Broussard doesn’t hold its annual boudin festival or crown a Boudin king anymore. But towns-people don’t see that as a reason for the leg-islature to snub them. ‘‘For some reason, Scott wants to be the Boudin capital, and they’re trying to take our title. Doesn’t hardly seem right,’’ says Billy Billeaud, owner of a grocery store in Broussard. Billy Billeaud’s grocery store in Broussard, La., advertises its boudin.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1169 June 28, 2012 Mr. Billeaud calls Scott a boudin arriviste whose meaty reputation is the product of ag-gressive marketing by numerous restaurants and meat specialty shops that have popped up in recent years on the edge of town to stuff boudin-loving travelers on busy Inter-state 10. ‘‘We don’t have I–10 in Broussard,’’ says Mr. Billeaud, 51 years old, the fourth genera-tion Billeaud to own the store since it opened in 1889. ‘‘Broussard can’t claim nothing. They had the title and haven’t done anything for 15 years,’’ fires back Aubrey Cole, owner of Don’s Specialty Meats just off I–10 in Scott. Meanwhile, in Jennings, 35 miles or so west on I–10, Mayor Terry W. Duhon can’t under-stand what the hot-dogging is all about. Jen-nings is Boudin Capital of the Universe, thanks to famed boudin chef and Jennings resident Ellis Cormier, who roamed the state decades ago promoting boudin and won the title for his hometown in the 1970s. ‘‘We’ve got squatter’s rights,’’ says Mr. Duhon, who has the phone number of his fa-vorite go-to joint—Mr. Cormier’s Boudin King—on speed dial. No signs or billboards in the town mention Jennings’s intergalactic ranking, because, ‘‘What do we need to pro-mote it for? We know,’’ he says. Such lofty titles are of no small impor- tance. Sales of boudin are on the rise, ac-cording to restaurateurs, online grocers and locals. The sausage has been featured on the menu at Cochon, a contemporary Cajun res-taurant in New Orleans’s trendy Warehouse District, which started serving a fried version of the sausage with pickled peppers last year. ‘‘Until we got the title, we never heard anything from Broussard or Jennings. Now they are coming out of the woodwork,’’ com-plains Donna Thibodeaux, who works at a tourism center in Scott next to one of the town’s five boudin sellers. Boudin’s precise origins are not a matter of noir and blanc, though the sausages have been made in southern Louisiana since the mid-1800s. Back then, French Acadians—an-cestors of the Cajuns—took leftover parts of a slaughtered pig and mixed them with rice, vegetables and seasonings and encased them in intestines. Some modern takes on boudin substitute pork with crawfish or shrimp. Mr. Cormier’s version used more rice than meat, helping popularize the sausage to non-Cajuns because it masked the taste of bolder ingre-dients like pork butt and liver. Boudin connoisseurs aren’t taking sides. Mr. Billeaud’s boudin in Broussard earned an ‘‘A+’’ on ‘‘The BoudinLink,’’ a review website operated by Bob Carriker, a history professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, the city that both Scott and Broussard border. But he also praises Scott for its juicy version and Jennings for letting rice take on ‘‘the starring role.’’ Lawmakers, for their part, are unapologetic about the grilling they are get-ting now from boudin makers about the mul-tiple titles. ‘‘This is not about the past, it’s about the future,’’ state Rep. Stephen Ortego said on the floor of the legislature, explain-ing his reasons for sponsoring the bill favor-ing Scott. He says his staff couldn’t find any legislation anointing Broussard as boudin capital, and the state representative who al-legedly backed that bill is deceased. As for Jennings, he says, the titles of ‘‘world’’ and ‘‘universe’’ can coexist because Jennings doesn’t promote its status. ‘‘Any-body can claim a title. But are you using it?’’ he reasons. On a recent morning, Mr. Ortego, who grew up near Scott, laid a paper napkin across his left leg and tucked into a link of Mr. Billeaud’s boudin. ‘‘This one has too much pepper,’’ he said, arguing that Scott’s is su-perior. Winning the title of Boudin Capital of the World was one of Mr. Morrison’s first legisla-tive goals when he became mayor in January 2011. Boudin makers employ 83 people in the town and account for $5 million in annual sales, helping anchor the local economy’s growth over the past decade. ‘‘Without boudin, we’d just be a regular I–10 exit, with a McDonald’s, a Burger King and a Chev-ron,’’ says Mr. Morrison, sitting in his office next to a two-year-old fire and police station that tax revenue from boudin sales helped fund. Rob Pelissier pulled off Scott’s I–10 exit one recent morning and headed to Don’s Spe-cialty Meats. The store has billboards pro-moting its ‘‘best homemade boudin’’ some 40 miles to the west—just a few miles outside Jennings. ‘‘Maybe Jennings or Broussard had the title years back. I’d say yeah, they were good back then. But nowadays, this place here has got it,’’ he said, staring at his empty plate. ‘‘If you spend a day here, you can see all of the traffic coming here from out of town.’’ Mr. Ortego’s legislation doesn’t ask Broussard to cede its title. For their part, Broussard town leaders have accepted their new role in the boudin world and have down-graded their expectations. The town’s mayor has considered seeking the title ‘‘Boudin Capital of Louisiana’’ next year. f A TRIBUTE TO FRANK M CCREA ON HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY HON. JACKIE SPEIER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great American, Frank McCrea, on the celebration of his 90th birth-day. Frank McCrea is a member of what we have rightfully come to call The Greatest Gen-eration. He is everything we have come to cel-ebrate about that celebrated group: a devoted son, brother and father; an unquestioning pa-triot; an extraordinary servant to his faith; and a true citizen of his community. Frank McCrea and his 5 brothers and sis- ters were raised in the depths of the Great Depression. Often, they had nothing more for dinner than the vegetables they grew in their own garden. Yet Frank will reflect on those years not about hardship and deprivation, but about how the love of a close family lit them from within. When the War came, Frank did not hesitate: he volunteered for the Navy, and served his country with honor. As one who personally has had her life saved by those who choose to serve our nation, I speak with special em-phasis in expressing our country’s eternal debt to those who serve in our armed forces. Faith has been at the core of Frank’s life. He has long been a deacon of his church and has been an active member of the Gideon So-ciety for over 40 years. All of us who have come into Frank’s remarkable orbit have felt the bond Frank has with his faith, and have come to know the special peace that faith has given to him. Another cornerstone for Frank has been friendship. I know that this weekend he will be surrounded by a legion of true friends, a num-ber who have been connected to Frank since high school—over 70 years ago. I think Frank can honestly boast that he has never lost a friend, and the number that he has gained is almost too large to measure. But central to Frank McCrea is being a magnificent father. In his local community the-ater, Frank has been cast as a dad over 15 times—for good reason. His daughters Karen, Christine and Beth have all gone on to raise children of their own and lead significant lives, but they all point to the bedrock of love from their father and mother that launched them. I truly believe that all of us would regard as our greatest accomplishment if our children were to feel about us as his daughters feel about him. In sum, Mr. Speaker, let me say that we are indeed fortunate to have citizens like Frank McCrea and that I join his church, his commu-nity, his friends and his family in wishing him the happiest of birthdays. f CONGRATULATIONS TO PEDDLER’S VILLAGE ON ITS 50TH ANNIVER-SARY HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Peddler’s Village in Bucks Coun-ty, Pennsylvania, as it celebrates its 50th An-niversary this month. A community staple in my home of Bucks County, millions of guests from across the Delaware and Lehigh Valleys have visited this center of commerce and culture over the last five decades. Founded in 1962 with the opening of a handful of small shops and a flagship res-taurant, Peddler’s Village now attracts 1.6 mil-lion annual visitors to its 70 independently- owned specialty shops, six restaurants and year-round festivals across its 42 acres of landscaped gardens and colonial-era architec-ture. The success of this collection of Bucks County small-business men and women in ful-filling the vision of its founder, Earl Jamison, serves as an example to each of us of the creativity and perseverance of the American spirit. Congratulations to Peddler’s Village on marking 50 years of tradition, and I wish them the best of luck in the decades to come. f HONORING THE FALLEN POLICE OFFICERS OF HENRICO COUNTY, VA HON. ERIC CANTOR OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the fallen police officers of Henrico County, VA. We have with us today the Henrico County Police Athletic League, who are in Washington to lay a wreath at the Na-tional Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, in honor of the fallen and their families. The legacy left by the fallen officers of Henrico County illuminates the strength of their commitment to public service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1170 June 28, 2012 County, VA have traveled to Washington to participate in today’s wreath laying ceremony. These students are part of a program offered by the Henrico County Police Athletic League that instills in young people the values of in-tegrity, self-respect, and discipline. I offer my support and gratitude to the fami- lies and countless friends of these officers that have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Their memory is an inspiration to all of us. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me today in remembering the fallen heroes of Henrico County, and thanking the Henrico Police Ath-letic League for service and commitment to our community. f DEATH OF TWO THOUSANDTH AMERICAN IN AFGHANISTAN HON. BARBARA LEE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, re- cently, as many of my colleagues have re-marked on the House floor, we reached the sad milestone of two thousand American sol-diers having lost their lives in Afghanistan. Tomorrow we break for our July 4th recess, celebrating our nation’s independence, but for too many American families missing a father, a son or a daughter, the fourth of July will be a day of absence. Mr. Speaker, we have a word for people who lose a spouse: ‘‘Widower.’’ We have a word also for the children left behind when parents die: ‘‘Orphans.’’ But we have no words for the parents of children who die. It is a tragedy when a parent outlives their child, and it is time to put an end to our chil-dren dying in Afghanistan. For the families of two thousand American soldiers, and equally important, for the Afghan families who have lost sons and daughters, we need to end this war and bring our soldiers home so that a political solution can be achieved. f IN HONOR OF YO AZAMA HON. SAM FARR OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec- ognize Mr. Yo Azama, a Japanese language teacher at North Salinas High School in Sali-nas, CA, who was named the 2012 National Language Teacher of the Year by the Amer-ican Council on the Teaching of Foreign Lan-guages (ACTFL). The National Language Teacher of the Year award was created to recognize a foreign language teacher who ex-hibits excellence in language education. Competition for the Foreign Language Teacher of the Award is quite steep as nomi-nees are first evaluated by their state lan-guage organization, after which each state submits its top candidate to one of five re-gional committees for additional review. Learning a foreign language opens minds to other worlds and has been scientifically prov-en to generate more flexibility in thinking. I was impressed by what Mr. Azama included in his application essay. He wrote ‘‘my experi-ence as a language teacher convinces me that today’s students are ready and more than willing to learn other languages and cultures, and prepare themselves to join a world that has no borders and offers them unlimited op-portunities if they have the linguistic and cul-tural competency . . . Language connects us and as a result it binds us the global family that we are.’’ Mr. Speaker, this national award goes to someone who shows incredible passion for his profession, for his students, and for his com-munity. I congratulate Mr. Azama on his much-deserved recognition as he continues to teach, lead, and inspire California’s youth. f TRIBUTE TO GAIL A. W. GOODRIDGE HON. JAMES P. MORAN OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Gail A. W. Goodridge, a leader in international development and a valued ad-visor and constituent, who recently passed away after a brave battle with cancer on June 18th. Gail is an example of national heroes who remain too often unsung—those who answer a call to serve directly those most in need, re-gardless of their location around the world. Working in the field of global health and devel-opment with Family Health International (FHI 360), she contributed to the lives of vulnerable women and children during extended postings in the Caribbean, where she began her ca-reer, and in East Africa, where she confronted the misery of the HIV/AIDS epidemic by founding and directing a truly innovative pro-gram (known as the ROADS Project) to pre-vent the spread of HIV/AIDS along African transport corridors. At home, Gail was just as active on behalf of social justice, working in Arlington through St. Charles Boromeo Catholic Church and in secular advocacy organizations promoting im-migrants’ rights and affordable housing. Wher-ever she was, Gail was renowned for her cre-ativity and hospitality, guided by her faith and her belief in doing the right thing. She was often in my office representing those without a voice with fierce idealism always tempered with compassion. She is remembered by her colleagues at home and abroad and by her faith communities, not only in Arlington, but in Kenya as well—by St. Joseph’s the Worker Church. Mr. Speaker, please join me in paying trib- ute to this worker in global human develop-ment and in offering condolences to Gail’s family and colleagues on her passing. HONORING MR. PETER D ECRAENE FOR RECEIVING THE 2011 PRESI-DENTIAL AWARD FOR EXCEL-LENCE IN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE TEACHING HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to con- gratulate Mr. Peter DeCraene, a math teacher at Evanston Township High School, for receiv-ing the 2011 Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching (PAEMST). The PAEMST program recognizes out- standing teachers for their contribution to teaching mathematics or science. Sponsored by the White House and administered by the National Science Foundation, PAEMST award recipients receive a certificate from President Obama and $10,000. The award only goes to the finest teachers of science and mathe-matics in the country. This year, President Obama recognized 97 mathematics and science teachers as recipi-ents of this esteemed award. The applicants were chosen for their abilities to convey the concepts of math and science to their stu-dents, along with their work experience, edu-cational background, and extracurricular activi-ties related to the classroom. The PAEMST program rewards teachers for preparing and establishing a solid foundation of science, technology, engineering, and math in Amer-ica’s youth. Peter DeCraene has succeeded throughout his career, creatively teaching these disciplines to his students while helping his colleagues to do the same. Mr. DeCraene’s passion and enthusiasm over the past 23 years have inspired hundreds of students so that they may better contribute to America’s success. The Chicago native graduated from DePaul University with a B.A. in mathematics, and an M.S. in computer science, and he received a Certificate of Ad-vanced Study in educational leadership from National Lewis University. He prefers teaching in small groups so that students may learn by answering one another’s questions. He is cur-rently the math department chair at Evanston Township High School, overseeing 30 teach-ers, along with instructing new teachers in the school wide induction program. The DePaul University graduate is also a textbook author who has presented at state and local con-ferences. Please join me in honoring my constituent, Peter DeCraene, and all the recipients of the 2011 Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching. This is an honor worthy of special distinction and I look forward to seeing more great things from Mr. DeCraene. f JULY 4, 2012 NATURALIZATION CEREMONY IN HAMMOND HON. PETER J.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1171 June 28, 2012 time to congratulate the individuals who will take their oath of citizenship on July 4, 2012. In true patriotic fashion, on the day of our great nation’s celebration of independence, a naturalization ceremony will take place, wel-coming new citizens of the United States of America. This memorable occasion, coordi-nated by the Hammond Public Library and presided over by Magistrate Judge Andrew Rodovich, will be held at The Pavilion at Wolf Lake in Hammond, Indiana. America is a country founded by immi- grants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the globe to the United States in search of better lives for their fami-lies. The upcoming oath ceremony will be a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America—that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for success than here in America. On July 4, 2012, the following people, rep- resenting many nations throughout the world, will take their oath of citizenship in Hammond, Indiana: Edina Anita Szabo, Jonathan Carmona Garcia, Alaa Alzayed, Oliva Chavez, Guolan Lu, Jaime Oseguera Cardenas, Dejan Kitevski, Jelica Dobrijevic, Karla Elizabeth Arreguin Farias, Ahmad Abdelrahim Almaaya, Huda Dali, Ljubica Vignjevic, Kefaa Nahed Omar Shuaibi, Rea Agulto Clarito, Senka Pamucar, Tanja Vignjevic, Liljana Josevski, Omiyosoye Adebowale Ololade, Mopelola Eniola Ololade, Blessing Obong Dennis, An Boo Min, Amanjot Kaur, Jingli Crain, Caroline Elizabeth Nyamweru Kamau, Halrun Luppes, Senija Crnkic, Siraneth Sem, Lenna Sabina Wade, Sanel Puzic, Jose Alberto Galicia Talabera, Tobias Florian Boes, Faneromeni Talia, James Murei Mumbura Karanja, Stella Gathoni Waithaka, Bacilia Avila, Mireya Jaquelin Aguilar, Gifty Debo Barlue, Esther Joo Young Chun, Patricia Contreras, Salvador Cruz, Nathaniel Tuason David, Luis Alberto Garcia, Njeri Mary Karumbo, Juliana Santos Kladis, Lenka Mitic, Innocent Ngenga, Eliza-beth Procyk, Jose Gustavo Suarez, Nour Alghnimi Ulayyet, and Jovita Zurita. Though each individual has sought to be- come a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-scribed it, a country ‘‘. . .of the people, by the people, and for the people.’’ They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision to live in a place where, as guar-anteed by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of pun-ishment, and assemble in peaceful protest should they choose to do so. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distin- guished colleagues to join me in congratu-lating these individuals, who will become citi-zens of the United States of America on July 4, 2012, the day of our nation’s independence. They, too, will be American citizens, and they, too, will be guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic nation, congratulate and welcome them. IN HONOR OF CLEVELAND CITY COUNCILWOMAN DONA BRADY HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Cleveland City Councilwoman Dona Brady, who has admirably served the resi-dents of Ward 17 since 1997. Born and raised in Cleveland, Council- woman Brady has been a leader in the Great-er Cleveland community for years. She at-tended Cleveland State University Levin Col-lege of Urban Affairs where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree, Cum Laude, in Urban Studies with a major in neighborhood revital-ization. She is also a graduate of CSU’s Lead-ership Academy. Before she was elected to Cleveland City Council, Brady worked for the Office of Cuya-hoga County Prosecutor William D. Mason, Judge Raymond L. Pianka and for the Cleve-land Board of Zoning Appeals. Throughout the past 15 years, Council- woman Brady has worked tirelessly to improve the quality of life in Ward 17 of Cleveland, which includes the West Boulevard and Clifton historic districts. She has worked toward pro-moting economic development, improving pub-lic safety, maintaining the ward’s housing stock and developing additional recreational opportunities for families. Brady serves as the Chair of the Public Service Committee, Vice- Chair of Public Safety, and as a member of the Council’s Finance and Community and Economic Development Committees. Councilwoman Brady is also involved in Cleveland’s Albanian-American community and has been named Cleveland’s Ambassador to Albania. She has been a constant in revital-izing the Albanian Cultural Garden in Rocke-feller Park and instrumental in building an international trade relationship with Fier, Alba-nia. Throughout the years and her career, Coun- cilwomen Brady has been honored by numer-ous organizations. She is the recipient of the 2005 Outstanding Elected Official’s Award from CSU Leadership Academy’s David C. Sweet Alumni Society. Additionally, she has been inducted into the Golden Key National Honor Society, and recognized by Jobs with Justice, the International Services Center and American Nationalities Movement. Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me in honoring Councilwoman Dona Brady for her years of service and commitment to the Great-er Cleveland area. f TRANSPORTATION WORKER IDEN- TIFICATION PROCESS REFORM ACT SPEECH OF HON. LAURA RICHARDSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 26, 2012 Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3173, which directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to reform the process for the enrollment, activation, issuance of renewal of a Transportation Work-er Identification Credential, TWIC, to require, in total, not more than one in-person visit to a designated enrollment center. The TWIC program was established to en- sure all individuals who require admittance into secure areas of regulated maritime facili-ties and vessels are properly vetted and do not pose a threat to maritime and supply chain security. Current TWIC requirements require that applicants go to an enrollment center twice to complete the application and confirm the biometric information embedded into the card. Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is an oner- ous burden for workers in the maritime indus-try, such as merchant vessel operators and truck drivers, who must obtain the credential for employment. Individuals in need of a TWIC card often work long hours with little down time. Many cannot afford to take extended pe-riods of time off to go to an enrollment center, in some cases located hundreds of miles away, on two different occasions. I believe that the Secretary of Homeland Security should reform the TWIC process be-fore the end of 2012, when the TWICs first issued in 2007 will need to be renewed allow-ing applicants to complete the process with only one in-person visit. I urge Members of Congress to support H.R. 3173, to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to reform the process for the enrollment, activation, issuance, and renewal of the TWIC program. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. SUE WILKINS MYRICK OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mrs. MYRICK. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to participate in the following votes.

SHELLEY BERKLEY OF NEVADA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Ms. BERKLEY.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1172 June 28, 2012 The National Council of La Raza became a national organization in 1972. NCLR has grown and evolved over the course of its his-tory to become the most authoritative voice on Hispanic issues today. Latinos are strength-ened through participation in NCLR and in the political process through its various civic en-gagement projects. NCLR also works to strengthen emerging community-based organi-zations in areas where there is a growing Latino population. Now in its 44th year, NCLR is busy building communities as an industry leader in home-ownership counseling, operating programs in 40 sites throughout the country. Its Charter School Development Initiative has helped cre- ate more than 40 new schools and strengthen more than 45 others, and its Institute for His-panic Health develops and implements health education and prevention programs and con-ducts health advocacy activities in partnership with its network of affiliates. NCLR’s education component is dedicated to increasing educational opportunities, im-proving achievement, supporting college-readi-ness, and promoting equity in outcomes for Latinos. The efforts of the education team build the capacity and strengthen the quality of the community-based education sector and in-form the broader public education system. NCLR’s economic and workforce advocacy seeks to ensure the Latino community’s ability to contribute to and share in the nation’s eco-nomic opportunities by promoting policies that boost Hispanic employment in good jobs, pro-vide safe and fair workplaces, bridge Latino workers’ education and skills gaps, and offer a secure retirement. With the Raza Development Fund, NCLR’s community development lending arm is one of the nation’s largest and most successful com-munity development banks. It has approved more than 117 loans totaling $54.6 million, leveraging more than $267 million in financing to community-based housing projects, schools, health clinics, and day care centers. More recently, in efforts to provide NCLR’s affiliates with more direct access to elected of-ficials in Washington, DC, earlier this year NCLR held its first annual NCLR National Ad-vocacy Day. The event convened affiliate members from 22 states who were briefed on the most important issues facing Latinos at the national level, including education, economic mobility, health, and immigration, and who met with Members of Congress to educate them about the needs of the community. As the Representative for Nevada’s First Congressional District, it gives me immense pride to recognize the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) and the role they play in edu-cating and training our community members, developing community leaders and fighting for equal rights and fair representation throughout the United States. I am especially pleased to welcome NCLR’s members and the tens of thousands of attendees for its 2012 annual conference to Las Vegas, Nevada. I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the great work of NCLR and wish them a most success-ful 2012 conference. INTRODUCTION OF THE TAXPAYER BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2012 HON. XAVIER BECERRA OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, I have intro- duced the Taxpayer Bill of Rights every Con-gress since 2008, and today I am proud to in-troduce the Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act of 2012, legislation that contains important provi-sions to improve services for and protect the rights of American taxpayers, particularly those with modest incomes. Senator Binga-man of New Mexico, a dedicated advocate for taxpayer rights, is introducing companion leg-islation in the Senate. Many of these provi-sions are based on proposals from the Na-tional Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olson, who has long been a champion of improving tax-payer services and tax administration at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As former Nixon Treasury Secretary William Simon said, ‘‘The nation should have a tax system that looks like someone designed it on purpose.’’ As we look for ways to restructure the tax code to make it fairer and more trans-parent for all taxpayers, it is critical that ideas to help improve IRS service and accessibility are included in this conversation. Every year, millions of taxpayers file their returns with the IRS and inevitably issues of tax administration come to the forefront. These issues range from taxpayers not knowing their legal rights when interacting with the IRS, to taxpayers enlisting unscrupulous or poorly-trained pre-parers to help them complete one of their most important financial transactions of the year. This legislation aims to help prevent tax-payers from finding themselves in these avoid-able situations, and to build on and improve taxpayer services provided through the IRS. The centerpiece of this Act is the require- ment that Treasury publish a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights will be be a simple and straightforward statement that enumerates all taxpayers’ rights and obliga-tions, as well as reference their location in the tax code. As the National Taxpayer Advocate explained in her 2011 Report to Congress: ‘‘In a time when the IRS will feel pressure to bring in additional tax revenue, it is crucial to pro-vide taxpayers with strong protection for their rights.’’ Currently, these rights and obligations are scattered throughout the tax code and In-ternal Revenue Manual, making them neither accessible nor written in plain language that most taxpayers can understand. This Act also helps improve the quality and accessibility of tax preparation services and advice available to taxpayers in several dif-ferent ways. First, it builds on the IRS’s initia-tive to regulate unenrolled tax preparers through examination and continuing education requirements, for which I have been a long time advocate. Implementation of the IRS tax return preparer framework is well underway, and this legislation will simply codify the exist-ing authority of the IRS to regulate tax return preparers. The Act also helps ensure mod-erate income taxpayers have access to quali-fied tax assistance by supporting a grant pro-gram for free income tax assistance services, and by allowing IRS referrals to Low-Income Taxpayer Clinics, which provide representation to modest income taxpayers in their disputes with the IRS. The Act also provides for over- sight over facilitators of high cost tax refund anticipation loans and other tax refund delivery products, and significantly increases penalties on preparers of fraudulent tax returns. Finally, this bill includes several provisions that would improve IRS taxpayer services. One important provision provides greater pro-tections for taxpayers when they are faced with a Notice of a Federal Tax Lien filing (NFTL). Filing of an NFTL can result in signifi-cant, long-term hardship to a taxpayer, and may adversely affect the taxpayer’s credit, thus impairing his or her ability to conduct fi-nancial transactions or secure employment. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act requires the IRS to make individualized determinations be-fore the filing of an NFTL, and also requires consideration of hardship factors and a tax-payer’s history of compliance before these de-terminations are made. Many of the problems identified in this bill have gone unaddressed for too long, causing confusion and undue hardship for taxpayers across the country. I encourage all of my col-leagues to support these common sense pro-visions to promote taxpayer rights and serv-ices for all Americans. f OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL DEBT HON. MIKE COFFMAN OF COLORADO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, on January 20, 2009, the day President Obama took office, the national debt was $10,626,877,048,913.08. Today, it is $15,778,950,543,472.67. We’ve added $5,152,073,494,559.59 to our debt in just over 3 years. This is debt our nation, our economy, and our children could have avoided with a balanced budget amendment. On this day in 1919, the Treaty of Versailles was signed in Paris, ending World War I. Without a balanced budget, the United States will no longer be able to bring peace to war-ring nations. f 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED WAY HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 125th Anniversary of United Way. Founded in 1887, United Way has become a celebrated organization committed to im-proving communities throughout the United States and around the world. Through locally targeted initiatives, United Way strives to ad-vance the common good, helping communities reach their full potential in the spirit of vol-unteerism and service.

In Southern California, United Way of Greater Los Angeles is dedi-cated to providing long term solutions for the root causes of poverty. Increasing the high school graduation rate, decreasing homeless-ness and implementing job training and asset development programs are part of a tireless effort to better our community and help people in need. To all of the passionate volunteers, employ- ees and partners of United Way, I join my col-leagues in recognizing and honoring your leg-acy of inspirational service. f COMMENDING THE FORMATION OF THE CONGRESSIONAL ANTI-BUL-LYING CAUCUS HON. LAURA RICHARDSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my appreciation for the Congressional Anti-Bullying Caucus, a new caucus formed to heighten congressional awareness and advo-cate for policies to combat bullying of all kinds, from the playground to the elderly care facility. Every American is entitled to live, work, and recreate in a safe environment, free of fear from threats to his or her physical safety and mental and emotional security. In recent years we have witnessed an ex- plosion in the number of reported and unre-ported cases of bullying. It is thirteen million children will be bullying victims this year alone. It is estimated also that 15 percent of Amer-ican school children skip school to avoid being bullied by schoolmates. This is tragic. Children who fear for their safety cannot learn. If they do not learn, they will not fulfill their potential. If they do not fulfill their position, the nation will be deprived of the talent it needs to com-pete and win in the global economy of the 21st century. If our children fall behind be-cause they lack a safe learning environment, America falls behind. The Congressional Anti- Bullying Caucus aims to do something about. Further, bullying jeopardizes not only the education of our children, but also their very well-being. The term ‘‘bullycide’’ has been coined to define the act of committing suicide as a result of bullying. This continues to be one of the leading causes of death for children under the age of 14. In fact, the rate of suicide among adolescents has grown more than 50 percent over the last 30 years. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately bullying does not end when our children move on from the play-ground. It exists on college campuses, in the workplace, online, and even in elderly care fa-cilities. Nearly half of Americans have experi-enced some sort of violence either in their workplace, at home, or in their community. Hazing on college campuses has been a prob-lem for decades. Five percent of all college students admit to being hazed, with 40 per-cent admitting that a coach or advisor was aware of the hazing and did not intervene. This lack of action is unacceptable. Our col-lege students must have the ability to focus on their work and prepare for their futures, with-out fear of physical or verbal hazing. Bullying in the workplace appears in various forms, from narcissistic bullying, to physical, to verbal. This abuse in the workplace creates a hostile work environment, making the organi-zation vulnerable to lawsuits, decreasing mo-rale, and reducing productivity. Thus, bullying is not only negatively impacting our future in the global market, but also our ability to com-pete today. In short, bullying has national im-plications and thus requires national attention and action. I am proud to be a charter member of the Congressional Anti-Bullying Caucus. I thank Representative H ONDA , the Chair of the Anti- Bullying Caucus, for his leadership and look forward to working with him and my fellow members of the caucus to reduce, if not end altogether, the scourge of bullying in our schools, neighborhoods, workplaces, and on-line. f STRENGTHENING AND FOCUSING ENFORCEMENT TO DETER ORGA-NIZED STEALING AND ENHANCE SAFETY ACT OF 2012 SPEECH OF HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 26, 2012 Ms. LINDA T. SA ´NCHEZ of California. Madam Speakers, I rise in support of H.R. 4223, the Safe Doses Act. I am proud to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in supporting this important legislation. H.R. 4223 addresses a difficult issue in the pharmaceutical supply chain: the theft of med-ical products. While this body last week passed important legislation to protect con-sumers from counterfeit drugs, there remains a real risk from stolen medical goods. This is a not a hypothetical exercise, it is a real problem. Criminal organizations who steal medical products are not concerned with stor-ing these materials properly, or ensuring that they are only sold with a doctor’s prescription. Let me give one brief, but telling example: In 2009, 128,000 vials of insulin were stolen in North Carolina. Beyond the $11 million mone-tary cost of this theft, there was a human cost as well. These vials were reintroduced into the sup- ply chain after being improperly stored. The vials found their way to pharmacies in 17 dif-ferent states, and at least two individuals suf-fered potentially fatal blood sugar levels before the FDA was able to alert the public to this danger. H.R. 4223 is a simple and sensible way to give law enforcement and prosecutors a stronger set of tools to go after criminal orga-nizations that are brazenly stealing vital medi-cation and devices. I further note that, beyond the bipartisan support this measure has re-ceived, the Safe Doses Act passed both the House Judiciary and Senate Judiciary Com-mittees unanimously. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation, clean up the pharmaceutical supply chain, and protect their constituents. IN RECOGNITION OF MRS. MARGARET S. RIKER HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mrs. Margaret Riker of Fair Haven, New Jersey. Mrs. Riker is the 2012 Count Basie Theatre’s Summer Soiree hon-oree. Mrs. Riker is a loving mother, profes-sional business woman and active member of the community. Her work and the recognition she is receiving from the Count Basie Theater are truly worthy of this body’s recognition. Margaret Riker hails from Bergen County, New Jersey and later moved to Fair Haven, New Jersey in 1989. Mrs. Riker is a proud member of the University of Vermont’s class of 1981 where she earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Psychology and English. Mrs. Riker was previously employed in marketing and sales promotion. Mrs. Riker was married to the late William Riker, and is the proud mother of three children, Katie, Jack and Teddy. The Riker family moved to Bermuda in 1993 to support Mr. Riker’s professional endeavors, returning to the United States in 2003. The Riker family currently resides in Rumson, New Jersey. Margaret Riker is dedicated to enhancing the quality of life in our local community. She currently serves as President of The Rumson Community Appeal and is a Foundation Board Member of Riverview Hospital. Mrs. Riker also serves as a Community Services Board Mem-ber to the Visiting Nurses Association of Cen-tral New Jersey, Gala Committee Member to Prevention First and supports The Rumson Country Day School and The Lawrenceville School. She passionately represents the mis-sion of these various organizations as a men-tor, advocate and leader. Maggie is also an active member of area clubs including the Sea Bright Tennis and Cricket Club and the Coral Beach Club. Mrs. Riker is committed to the success of the Count Basie Theatre as a re-sult of her passion for the performing arts. Her philanthropic efforts dedicated to maintaining and improving the Count Basie Theatre and the arts will continue enhance future perform-ances. Mr. Speaker, once again, please join me in congratulating Margaret Riker for serving as honoree at the Count Basie Theatre’s Summer Soiree. Mrs. Riker’s contributions to her family and community continued to resonate with the constituents throughout Monmouth County, New Jersey. f DEPUTY SHERIFF SHERVIN LALEZARY HON. HOWARD L.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1174 June 28, 2012 during the day and dedicates his time to vol- unteer as Reserve Deputy Sheriff with the L.A. Sheriff’s Department at night. At 3 a.m. on January 2, 2012, Deputy Sher- iff Lalezary became a local hero and a na-tional sensation when he captured Harry Burkhart, a 24-year-old German national whom Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca called ‘‘perhaps . . . the most dangerous ar-sonist in the county of Los Angeles.’’ Burkhart was arrested for setting a rash of car and building fires across the city. Following his ar-rest, there were no more suspicious fires doc-umented in Los Angeles. Deputy Sheriff Lalezary is a hero who dem- onstrates exemplary values and integrity and most-importantly inspires his peers. During his numerous press conferences, public events, and even an appearance on the TV show ‘‘Ellen,’’ he has continued to impress us with his selfless dedication and altruism. He contin-ually downplays his role in the arrest, deflect-ing questions about himself and his personal life, and praising the deputies at the sheriff’s West Hollywood station. Shervin’s commitment to serving Los Ange- les and keeping us safe reflects the Jewish value of tikkun olam and the importance of giving back to our country. 30 Years After, an Iranian-American non-profit organization that promotes civic participation, rightfully pre-sented Shervin with the 2012 Public Service Award on behalf of 30 Years After and the Persian-American community. Mr. Speaker and distinguished colleagues, we ask you to join us in recognizing Deputy Sheriff Shervin Lalezary for his years of serv-ice and dedication to the safety and well being of our community. He is the epitome of a true humanitarian. f HONORING THE SERVICE OF JUDGE DAMON J. KEITH HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the career and service to the United States of Judge Damon J. Keith on the occasion of his 90th birthday. Since joining the federal judiciary, Judge Keith has steadfastly and courageously pro-tected the constitutional and civil rights of this country’s citizens. In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson ap- pointed Judge Keith to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, making him only the second African-American to sit on that court at that time. During his tenure on the District Court, Judge Keith delivered sev-eral key civil rights rulings. He addressed the issue of school desegregation in Davis v. School District of the City of Pontiac in 1970; of employment discrimination and affirmative action in Stamps v. Detroit Edison Co., in 1973 and Baker v. City of Detroit in 1979; and finally, of housing discrimination in Garrett v. City of Hamtramck in 1971 and Zuch v. Hussey in 1975. Judge Keith became Chief Judge of the Eastern District of Michigan in 1975. In 1971, Judge Keith issued a landmark civil liberties ruling in U.S. v. Sinclair, which came to be known as the ‘‘Keith decision.’’ Later unanimously upheld by the United States Su- preme Court, Judge Keith’s decision held un-constitutional wiretap surveillance absent a court order in domestic security cases. Judge Keith continued to safeguard con- stitutional rights and civil liberties on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, where he has served since his ap-pointment in 1977 by President James E. Car-ter. In the 1980s, Judge Keith served as chair of Sixth Circuit and Judicial Conference Com-mittees commemorating the Bicentennial of the Constitution. He took senior status in 1995. Judge Keith was born in Detroit, Michigan on July 4, 1922 and became the first member of his family to attend college, earning a bach-elor’s degree from West Virginia State Col-lege. After serving our Nation for three years in the U.S. Army, he went on to receive an LL.B. from Howard University Law School and an LL.M. in labor law from Wayne State Uni-versity Law School. Judge Keith started his legal career with the African-American Detroit law firm of Loomis, Jones, Piper & Colden and was one of six De-troit attorneys invited to the White House in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy to discuss the role of lawyers in the civil rights struggle. Later, Judge Keith and four other African- American attorneys established a law firm in what had previously been the all-white legal district of downtown Detroit. At this time, Judge Keith also served as Chair of the Michi-gan Civil Rights Commission and President of the Detroit Housing Commission. Throughout his distinguished career, Judge Keith has received numerous honors and awards, including: the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s highest award, the Spingarn Medal, in 1974; the American Bar Association’s Thurgood Marshall Award in 1997; and, the Edward J. Devitt Award for Distinguished Service to Justice in 1998, presented by a panel comprised of a United States Supreme Court Justice, a fed-eral circuit court judge, and a federal district court judge. Judge Keith also holds honorary degrees from Harvard University, Yale University, Georgetown University, the University of Michigan, Tuskegee University, and over thirty other institutions. In addition, Judge Keith has played an ac- tive role in numerous civic, cultural, and edu-cational organizations, including the Detroit YMCA, the Detroit Arts Commission, the De-troit Cotillion Club, and Interlochen Arts Acad-emy, and has served as an active fundraiser for the United Negro College Fund and the Detroit NAACP. For fifty-three years, Judge Keith was mar- ried to the late Rachel Boone Keith, M.D., with whom he had three daughters, Gilda, Debbie, and Cecile. For his consistent defense of the Constitu- tion and the civil rights of all people, on his 90th birthday, I honor and thank Judge Keith for his invaluable service to the United States. INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE XIX INTER-NATIONAL AIDS CONFERENCE HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a resolution in support of the XIX International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2012), which takes place from July 22, 2012, through July 27, 2012, at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC. This year’s conference is of particular sig-nificance, as it represents the return of the International AIDS Conference to the United States after the 1987 HIV travel and immigra-tion ban was lifted in 2010. My resolution sup-ports a stronger international response to HIV/ AIDS that seeks to foster greater scientific and programmatic collaborations around the world in order to prevent the transmission of HIV; in-crease access to testing, treatment, and care; and improve health outcomes for all people living with HIV/AIDS. There are currently 33.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, and more than 25 million have died of AIDS since the first cases were reported in 1981. In the United States, more than one million people are living with HIV/AIDS and approximately 50,000 individ-uals become newly infected with the virus each year. Furthermore, one in five individuals living with HIV is unaware of their infection and societal stigma remains a significant chal-lenge, underscoring the need for greater edu-cation about HIV/AIDS and access to testing. Significant disparities also persist across di-verse communities and populations with re-gard to incidence, access to treatment, and health outcomes, particularly for men who have sex with men (MSM), racial and ethnic minorities, women, and young people. Since 1985, the now biennial International AIDS Conference has brought together the world’s leading scientists, public health ex-perts, policymakers, community leaders, and persons living with HIV/AIDS in order to ad-dress the major issues facing the global re-sponse to HIV/AIDS; evaluate recent scientific developments and share knowledge; and fa-cilitate a collective strategy forward. AIDS 2012 is organized by the International AIDS Society (IAS) and expected to convene more than 20,000 delegates from nearly 200 coun-tries, including 2,000 journalists. The theme of AIDS 2012, ‘‘Turning the Tide Together,’’ em-bodies both the promise and urgency of uti-lizing recent scientific advances in HIV/AIDS treatment and biomedical prevention; con-tinuing research for an HIV vaccine and cure; and scaling up effective, evidence-based inter-ventions in key settings in order to change the course of the HIV/AIDS crisis. AIDS 2012 is a tremendous opportunity to further strengthen the role of the United States in global HIV/AIDS initiatives; re-energize the response to the domestic epidemic within the current context of significant global economic challenges; and focus particular attention on the devastating impact that HIV is having on different communities across the country. My resolution supports the goal of bringing re-newed awareness of, and commitment to, ad-dressing the HIV/AIDS crisis in the United States and abroad. In particular, it recognizes VerDate Mar 15 2010 03:50 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A28JN8.016 E28JNPT1smartinez on DSK6TPTVN1PROD with REMARKS

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1175 June 28, 2012 that formulating sound public health policy; protecting human rights; advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights; addressing stigma, poverty, and other societal challenges; and ensuring accountability are key to over-coming HIV/AIDS. It also encourages the on-going development of innovative therapies and advances in clinical treatment for HIV/AIDS in the public and private sectors. Mr. Speaker, continued commitment by the United States to HIV/AIDS research, preven-tion, and treatment programs is crucial to pro-tecting global health. I urge my colleagues to support my resolution, which recognizes the importance of the XIX International AIDS Con-ference in the global effort to end the HIV/ AIDS pandemic and create an ‘‘AIDS-free generation.’’ We are closer to a future without HIV/AIDS than ever before. Together with the international community, we have the means to bring an end to HIV/AIDS once and for all. What we need now is leadership and soli-darity. f A TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF DR. ROBERT J. GLASER HON. ANNA G. ESHOO OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Robert J. Glaser, former Dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine and a national figure in medical education. Dr. Glaser passed away on June 7, 2012, at his home in Palo Alto, sur-rounded by his family. Dr. Glaser, who was 93 years old, is survived by three children; Sally, Joseph Glaser II and Robert Glaser, Jr., and four grandchildren. His beloved wife Helen Glaser passed away in 1999. Dr. Glaser was born and raised in St. Louis. He received his undergraduate degree from Harvard College in 1940 and his M.D., magna cum laude, from Harvard Medical School in 1943. He then returned to St. Louis to do his residency at Barnes Hospital of Washington University School of Medicine. While at Barnes, his ‘‘wandering eye fixed on an attractive young woman in the senior class,’’ he wrote in his Harvard 25th reunion memoir. The medical student and soon-to-be pediatrician was Helen Hofsommer, M.D. She would become Glaser’s wife. After their wedding, the couple spent the next eight years in St. Louis, while Dr. Glaser moved through the ranks at Washington Uni-versity, rising from Instructor to Associate Pro-fessor to Assistant Dean and Associate Dean of the Medical School. In 1956, he accepted the position of Dean of Medical School and Vice President for Medical Affairs at the Uni-versity of Colorado. In 1963, he was tapped to lead Affiliated Hospitals Center Inc., in Boston, an ambitious, $50 million merger of six Har-vard-affiliated hospitals. In 1965, he was named the Dean of the Stanford School of Medicine, which had moved from San Francisco to Palo Alto. ‘‘Though he came after the move, he was the one who shepherded the school through its formative years to get everything settled—get the molecules in motion,’’ said James B.D. Mark, M.D., who arrived at Stanford the same year. ‘‘He was a leader at a critical time in the life of this medical school.’’ Dr. Mark described Dr. Glaser as someone who had ‘‘great en-ergy, great experience, high standards and worked hard.’’ Paul Berg, Ph.D., said Dr. Glaser was a caring person who was ‘‘easy to talk to. It was always fun to talk to him. And he was very devoted to the school.’’ At the time, the hospital on campus was co- owned by the city of Palo Alto. As Dean and Vice President for Medical Affairs at Stanford, Dr. Glaser oversaw the purchase of the city’s share of the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital in 1968. ‘‘Dr. Robert Glaser was an extraordinary figure in American medicine and at Stanford specifically,’’ said Philip Pizzo, M.D., the cur-rent Dean of the Stanford School of Medicine. ‘‘Dr. Glaser’s vision shaped Stanford Medicine as we know it today, and his contributions have had an indelible mark on individuals, in-stitutions and communities, locally and glob-ally.’’ Dr. Glaser was tapped to serve as Acting President of Stanford University following the retirement of Dr. J.E. Wallace Sterling. He led the University at a tumultuous time of student protests against the war in Vietnam and was lauded by students for his sensitivity and re-sponsiveness. At the medical school, Dr. Glaser also oversaw major changes in the cur-riculum to give students greater flexibility—a feature that remains a hallmark of the cur-riculum today. Even into his 90s, Dr. Glaser continued to attend medical grand rounds and teaching conferences. After serving as Dean for five years, Dr. Glaser left Stanford in 1970 to serve as Vice President and Trustee at the Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based philanthropy devoted to improving health care. ‘‘Before he left for the Commonwealth Fund, his line was, ‘I’m going to see if it’s better to give, than not to receive,’ ’’ said Dr. Mark, recalling Glaser’s dry wit. He subsequently went on to serve as Presi- dent, Chief Executive Officer and Trustee of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation from 1972 through 1983. From 1984–97, he was Director for Medical Science and Trustee of the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust, where he oversaw distribution of more than $500 mil-lion in support of medical science research, in-cluding the establishment of the Markey Trust Scholar Program. Dr. Glaser also had a long-term involvement with the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. Initially engaged through its research institute, in 1981 he became a founding member of its Board of Trustees and continued as an Emeritus Trust-ee through 2008. A member of Alpha Omega Alpha, he served on its Board of Directors and as the Editor from 1962–97 of its scholarly journal The Pharos, while his wife served as Man-aging Editor. Dr. Robert Glaser was also active nationally in medical education through the Association of American Medical Colleges and served on the National Advisory Committee on Higher Education. He was a founding member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and served on the boards of many organizations, including Washington University, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Packard Humanities Institute, the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, the Kaiser Hospitals and Health Plan, Hewlett- Packard and Alza Corp. He also received many awards and honors, including the Abraham Flexner Medal for Dis-tinguished Service to Medical Education; the Stearns Award for Lifetime Achievement in Medicine from the New York Academy of Medicine; the Dean’s Medal from Stanford School of Medicine; the Dean’s Medal from the Harvard Medical School; and the Harvard Medal for Distinguished Service. In addition to his professional interests, Dr. Glaser had a lifelong passion for the commer-cial airline industry. Over the years, said his daughter, Sally Glaser, Ph.D., ‘‘He and one of my brothers would often sit out in the back- yard, listening to air traffic control communica-tions as they looked at the approaching air-craft through binoculars.’’ He was an avid trav-eler, logging more than five million miles in air travel for both professional and pleasure trips, including his last trip to Harvard in 2010 to at-tend his 70th college reunion. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our deepest condolences to Dr. Glaser’s three children, his four grandchildren, his colleagues and his students who knew and loved him throughout his extraordinary life. Dr. Glaser was a kind man, a brilliant doctor and a masterful educator. His life stands as an in-spiration to all and a model of citizenship. He bettered our Nation, and gladdened our world. f SECURING MARITIME ACTIVITIES THROUGH RISK-BASED TAR-GETING FOR PORT SECURITY ACT SPEECH OF HON. PETER T. KING OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 26, 2012 Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I am submitting the following letter exchange for the R ECORD between myself and Chairman DAVECAMP of the House Committee on Ways and Means: HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, June 27, 2012. Hon. P ETER KING, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN KING: I am writing to you concerning the bill H.R. 4251, the ‘‘Securing Maritime Activities through Risk-based Tar-geting for Port Security Act.’’ This legisla-tion includes several provisions in section 201 that pertain to the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways & Means with respect to Customs and Border Protection’s mission of facilitating the efficient flow of legitimate commerce. The Committee recognizes the importance of H.R. 4251 and the need to move expedi-tiously. Therefore, the Committee is willing to forego action on the bill with the under-standing that by doing so, the Committee is not in any way prejudiced with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives or the appoint-ment of conferees on this or similar legisla-tion. In addition, I appreciate your agreement that the Ways & Means Committee be in-cluded within the definition of ‘‘appropriate congressional committees’’ so that it will re-ceive the implementation and strategic plans required in section 201 of the bill.

TIMOTHY V. JOHNSON OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I was present for rollcall No. 431 and 433, and was off the floor talking with constituents from Douglas and Piatt Counties, and inadvertently missed the vote. I support the fiscal savings attendant to this amendment but had concerns over its language. Therefore, if present, I would have voted ‘‘Present.’’ f TRIBUTE TO RICHARD COLEMAN KELLEY HON. MARY BONO MACK OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mrs. BONO MACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleague and friend, Con-gressman K ENCALVERT , to honor and pay trib- ute to a dear friend, Richard Coleman Kelley. Richard passed away on Thursday, June 14, 2012. A devoted husband, brother, father, and grandfather, he will be deeply missed. Richard was born March 19, 1930 in Co- rona, California to David and Margaret Kelley, who were beginning to develop their property in Hemet into a citrus grove. He attended schools in Corona, and after graduating from the Army and Navy Academy in Carlsbad, California, he served honorably in the United States Air Force from 1950 to 1954. He spent a semester at the University of California at Davis before returning to work for his father on their family’s ranch, only to later develop a cit-rus ranch of his own. In 1957, Richard married Jeanne Vig and continued to farm in Hemet while raising their three children, where he was partner of Kelley Citrus and owned Circle K Five Citrus. It is hard to imagine that Richard had any free time on his hands, and yet he always found time for his community and family. Rich-ard was active in his church, was vice presi-dent of the Riverside County Farm Bureau, president of the Hemet Optimist Club, was ac-tive in parent-teacher organizations, and sup-ported every team and club in which his chil-dren participated. He also served on the board of Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD) beginning in September of 1981, serving on the Legal Committee and as Chairman of the Building and Grounds Committee. Richard also enjoyed inventing, skiing, jogging, and farming. In fact, many of Richard and Jeanne’s ‘‘vacations’’ were spent helping work on their daughter’s and son’s farms in Idaho. In response to the high water costs that could have forced small farmers out of busi-ness in the early 1980s, Richard once said, ‘‘Agricultural water is my main interest . . . something has to be done.’’ And as an EMWD board member and concerned citizen, he worked tirelessly to address this threat to an American way of life. That is just one testa-ment to his can-do spirit and willingness to help solve problems in his home town that made him such a treasure to the Riverside County area for so long, and is what we will remember about him most. On Wednesday, June 27, 2012, a memorial service celebrating Richard’s extraordinary life was held. Richard will always be remembered for his legendary work ethic, generosity, con-tributions to the community, and love of family. His dedication to his work, family, and commu-nity are a testament to a life well-lived and a legacy that will continue. I extend my deepest condolences to Richard’s family and friends. Although Richard may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to our great State will never be diminished and will never be forgot-ten. Richard is survived by his children, Janice of Hemet, Kathy of Weiser, Idaho and Ron of Weiser, Idaho; five grandchildren; and his brother, former California State Assemblyman and Senator, David Kelley. Our thoughts and prayers are with Richard’s family and the many others he touched. f JUSTICE FOR MIR QUASEM ALI HON. JOE WILSON OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speak- er, last week, as a Member of the House For-eign Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, I met Mir Ahmad BinQuasem of Bangladesh. Mir Ahmad in-formed me that his father, Mir Quasem Ali, was arrested on June 17, 2012, by the Ban-gladesh International, War, Crimes Tribunal for alleged crimes committed during the 1971 War of Liberation against then-West Pakistan, and for campaigning ‘‘against the process of this [War Crimes] Tribunal in foreign countries.’’ Mir Quasem Ali is the owner of Bangladesh’s largest opposition-run media outlet, which has been openly critical of the Tribunal and of the ruling government at-large. As such, I am con-cerned that his arrest and ongoing detention may represent a thinly-veiled attempt by the ruling government of Bangladesh to silence its opponents and critics. In addition to my concerns about this arrest, it has come to my attention that the Tribunal itself is inherently flawed and lacks compliance with international standards. It appears that the Tribunal is international in name only, as it lacks international oversight or involvement, experienced foreign attorneys have been banned from participating, and the Tribunal violates at least two of Bangladesh’s inter-national treaty obligations. Tribunal defendants are not only denied access to international standards of justice, but several of the rights granted by domestic law. These include the right to an independent appeal, which is ex-plicitly denied to defendants of the Tribunal. As a member of the Middle East and South Asia subcommittee, I am very concerned about the implications that Mir Quasem Ali’s arrest has for the state of democracy within Bangladesh. I will continue to closely monitor this situation and I hope that Bangladesh will take assertive measures to ensure that its up-coming elections are conducted in a openly democratic matter. I am hopeful for a bright fu-ture for the people of Bangladesh with open and fair justice for all of its citizens. f OPPOSING THE CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 4348 HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I have declined to add my signature to the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 4348, legislation to reau-thorize the highway trust fund. While the highway bill has traditionally been the product of reasonable, bipartisan com-promise, the House Republican’s version of this year’s bill was so extreme the Conference Report was hobbled from the start. House Republicans took the jobs and eco- nomic development promised by this highway bill hostage—with unrelated provisions like the Keystone pipeline as the ransom—and the Senate had no choice but to negotiate with the hostage takers. Provisions allocating critical conservation funding across the country, through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and a National Endowment for the Oceans, was struck from the Conference Report; only funding for the five Gulf States—Alabama, Mississippi, Lou-isiana, Florida and Texas—has survived. That funding will certainly be beneficial but the broader conservation programs should have been included, as well. The Conference Report also includes provi- sions prohibiting the National Park Service from complying with the law limiting the im-pacts of aircraft noise on Grand Canyon Na-tional Park. Why we would want to use a transportation bill to make one of the crown jewels of the National Park System louder and dirtier is a mystery. Most troubling, the Conference Report in- cludes unjustified and harmful provisions which will undermine environmental reviews of highway and transit projects. Republicans have claimed environmental reviews delay highway projects but the facts are that most transportation projects already proceed under expedited environmental reviews and there is no evidence whatsoever that these reviews cause delay.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1177 June 28, 2012 Nevertheless, the Conference Report in- cludes several broad new categorical exclu-sions from the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. These new exclusions lack flexibility or adequate standards and will limit public participation and careful consideration of transportation projects that can have dev-astating impacts on neighborhoods and our natural, cultural and historic resources. In the end, the purpose of these provisions is to speed up highway construction, not by cutting alleged ‘‘red-tape’’ but by making it harder for local communities to gather information and have input in projects that may go right through their backyards. Unbelievably, the Conference Report also includes a radical new idea that agencies should be fined, through rescission of up to 7 percent of their budgets, for missing arbitrary deadlines for environmental reviews. Given that the main reason agencies struggle to complete these reviews quickly is a lack of funding and staff, cutting their budgets as pun-ishment will only make the problem worse. Inclusion of funding for the Secure Rural Schools and the Payment in Lieu of Taxes programs are positive steps, while removal of divisive, unrelated provisions on coal ash and the Keystone Pipeline are welcome improve-ments, compared to the House Republican bill. Finally, the process used to develop this Conference Report was unfortunate. Con-ferees have been asked to sign an agreement we have had little or no time to review and the substance of the agreement was negotiated largely without input from most conferees. This Conference Report will harm those liv- ing and working near transportation projects in the future and fails to address some of the most pressing conservation needs facing this nation. We can and should do better. f 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ST. PAUL YACHT CLUB HON. BETTY McCOLLUM OF MINNESOTA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Ms. M CCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the Saint Paul Yacht Club in honor of the 100th Anniversary of the organization. For a century, this venerable institution has been providing safe and affordable boating opportu-nities to residents of Saint Paul and sur-rounding communities. Since 1912, the Saint Paul Yacht Club has played a central role promoting and providing access to Minnesota’s premier waterways. Originally known as the Saint Paul Motorboat Club, the early club served an active and growing speed boating population on all three of Minnesota’s major rivers, the Mississippi, the Minnesota, and the Saint Croix. Early members could rent boat slips for 10 cents per foot, and purchase gasoline for 10 cents per gallon. To retrieve the gasoline, 5 gallon cans were lowered by a rope from the Wabasha Bridge to the boaters on the water. In addition to providing helpful services to its members, the Saint Paul Yacht Club orga-nized picnics, boat races and other social and recreational events. Boat races were particu-larly popular in the 1920s and 1930s. On one occasion, Christopher Columbus Smith— founder of the iconic Chris Craft boat com- pany—set a world water speed record at a club organized boat race. The Saint Paul Yacht Club has remained in continuous operation since 1912, and currently manages two state of the art harbor facilities within the jewel of the Saint Paul public parks—Harriet Island Regional Park—on the Mississippi River in the city’s downtown. Today, the harbor remains a hub of activity, hosting 230 boat slips for vessels that are up to 50 feet long, and serving as home to a thriving year-round live-aboard and seasonal boating community. Boaters come from near and far to enjoy the tremendous views of Saint Paul and the surrounding natural beauty of the Mississippi River National River Recreation Area. Throughout its century of service to the boating public, the Saint Paul Yacht Club has served as a model of responsible stewardship to Minnesota waterways. By promoting safe and accessible boating activities, the club has provided a tremendous service to many Saint Paul residents and visitors. The Saint Paul Yacht Club is truly an exemplary asset to our city and state. Mr. Speaker, in honor of the 100th Anniver- sary of the Saint Paul Yacht Club, it is a privi-lege to submit this statement for the C ONGRES - SIONAL RECORD . f TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RE-LATED AGENCIES APPROPRIA-TIONS ACT, 2013 SPEECH OF HON. LAURA RICHARDSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, June 27, 2012 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5972) making ap-propriations for the Departments of Trans-portation, and Housing and Urban Develop-ment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, and for other pur-poses: Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Chair, later this week, the House is scheduled to consider H.R. 5972, the Transportation & Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Art for Fiscal Year 2013. This bill funds the agencies that address our nation’s housing and transportation needs, and is one of the most important pieces of legislation the House will consider this year. The THUD bill rep-resents a tremendous opportunity to improve our economic competitiveness and ensure the wellbeing of working Americans, and I rise to offer some preliminary observations on the bill that will be debated over the next several days. I serve as a proud Member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastruc-ture, and my home district is home to some of the busiest freeways, railways and ports in the country. I also have the privilege of rep-resenting many economically disadvantaged individuals who benefit from the fair housing initiatives and grant programs covered in this bill. I have long advocated, and will continue to advocate, on behalf of the 37th Congressional District of California for an enlightened trans- portation policy that will position the United States to compete and win in the global econ-omy of the 21st Century. Since many amend-ments will have to be considered before the vote on final passage, I am reserving my final judgment as to how I will cast my vote. Never-theless, I would like to take a moment to com-mend Mr. L ATHAM and Mr. O LVER , the Chair and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, for their work, including nine major funding re-quests that I submitted to the Committee in the bill reported to the House. Specifically the bill includes the following: Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program. CDBG is the centerpiece of the federal governments efforts to help more than 1200 cities, counties and states meet the needs of their low and moderate-income peo- ple and communities. It revitalizes commu-nities—with proven results. CDBG helps fund a wide range of activities including housing in-vestments, public infrastructure improvements, public services, and local economic develop-ment projects where the private market is ab-sent. The Committee recommended $3.344 billion, which was $44 million above my re-quest. Fair Housing Initiatives Program. FHIP is a competitive grant program and is the primary source of funding for fair housing education and enforcement activities at the local level. Local fair housing organizations funded by FHIP protect the housing rights of the public and educate people about their fair housing rights. The program is vital given the extreme fragility that currently exists in the housing market. The Committee met my request by continuing funding at the FY12 level of $42.5 million. Tenant Based Rental Assistance Program. HUD’s Section 8 programs help low-income elderly, families with children, and people with disabilities secure and maintain decent, afford-able homes. In both urban and rural commu-nities, Section 8 rental assistance provides the foundation for millions of individuals and fami-lies to live with dignity, maintain steady work, and improve the lives of their children. The Committee recommended approximately $19.1 billion for this program, or $60 million above my request. Community Planning and Development from the Department of Housing and Urban Devel-opment. HUD’s The Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) seeks to develop viable communities by promoting inte-grated approaches that provide decent hous-ing, a suitable living environment, and expand economic opportunities for low and moderate income persons. The primary means towards this end is the development of partnerships among all levels of government and the pri-vate sector, including for-profit and non-profit organizations. The Committee recommended $103.5 million. Although this was slightly below my request, it exceeded the FY12 level of funding by $3.5 million. Indian Community Development Block Grant. The Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) program provides com-petitive grants to Indian tribes and Alaska Na-tive villages for housing, community facilities, and economic development. ICDGB funds community infrastructure like roads and sewer systems that improve the quality of available housing units while making new housing more affordable and accessible. The Committee met my request of $60 million.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1178 June 28, 2012 Native American Housing Block Grants. In- dian Housing Block Grants go directly to trib-ally designated housing entities (TDHEs) for housing development, housing services for eli-gible families, crime prevention and safety, and demonstration projects that provide cre-ative approaches to solving affordable housing shortages. TDHEs must submit an Indian Housing Plan each year they receive funding, followed by an end-of-year Annual Perform-ance Report to report on progress towards meeting their goals. The Committee rec-ommended $650 million for these grants, thereby meeting my request. HUD–VASH Program. HUD–VASH is the only program that supports the permanent housing and rehabilitation of homeless vet-erans. HUD–VASH is a joint HUD and VA ini-tiative that provides specially designated Sec-tion 8 ‘‘Housing Choice’’ vouchers, case man-agement, and supportive services to homeless veterans. Vouchers are used to assist with the payment of rent for veterans and their families. The goal of the program is to support vet-erans’ permanent housing in the community. The Committee’s recommendation was equal to my request of $75 million. Maritime Security Program. The Maritime Security Program ensures that the United States has the U.S.-flag commercial sealift ca-pability and trained U.S. citizen merchant mariners available to crew the government and privately-owned vessels needed by the Department of Defense in time of war or other international emergency. The Committee matched my request of $184 million, which in-creased funding over FY12 levels by $10 mil-lion. Housing for the Elderly (Section 202) Cap- ital Advance Program. Capital advances fi-nance construction, rehabilitation, or acquisi-tion of structures that will serve as supportive housing for very low-income elderly persons. Section 202 provides rent subsidies for projects to help keep them affordable for these vulnerable populations. We recommend rein-stating funding to allow affordable special needs housing developers to provide sup-portive housing options for the elderly, particu-larly within AANHPI enclaves. The Committee exceeded my request for funding by allocating $425 million. Mr. Chair, I again extend my sincere thanks to Chairman L ATHAM and Ranking Member OLVER for their careful consideration of my ap- propriations requests. While I reserve my final judgment on this bill, I do believe that the full funding of these programs and departments will make a real difference in boosting the economy and improving the lives of vulnerable communities. f IN RECOGNITION OF THE 95TH AN- NIVERSARY OF THE FRESNO COUNTY FARM BUREAU HON. JIM COSTA OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ex- tend my sincerest congratulations to the Fres-no County Farm Bureau which is celebrating its 95th anniversary this year. Since its estab-lishment in 1917, the organization has contin-ued to evolve. It began as general farm orga-nization as an arm of the Agriculture Exten- sion Service, and is now at the forefront of farming in California. As it nears the end of its first century, it continues to lead the agri-culture industry and the community in ad-dressing issues that result in long-term eco-nomic viability for agriculture and promoting the economic vitality of the region as we move forward in the 21st Century. The Farm Bureau started shortly after the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 established the Agri-culture Extension Service. The Act stipulated that before a county could obtain farm advisor services, it had to form a general farm organi-zation through which the Extension Service could disseminate information and promote better farming methods. In the fall of 1917, George Fever, J.A. Poytress, Sam Heisinger, H.W. Wrightson and Charles Parlier were among a group of farmers that met with Leroy Smith, the first Extension Service farm advisor assigned to Fresno County, to lay the ground-work for a Fresno County Farm Bureau orga-nization. Fresno County Farm Bureau, like many other County Farm Bureau organizations, was originally set up in joint offices within the Uni-versity of California Agriculture Extension Service. The Farm Bureau membership rose and fell in the pre-World War II days, dropping to 350 during the Depression. The largest growth in membership occurred around the Farm Bureau’s 50th anniversary, between 1945 and 1967 when it rose from 1,000 to 4,500 members. Today, the Fresno County Farm Bureau represents more than 4,000 members. In the early 1960s, Fresno County took first place in total production value of ag-riculture commodities. Fresno County remains the number one agricultural county in the country, bringing in $5.94 billion in 2010. The Farm Bureau has played an integral role in many projects throughout its history, in-cluding: presenting President Franklin D. Roo-sevelt a program to strengthen agriculture dur-ing the Great Depression years in 1931; partnering with the Madera, Tulare and Kings County Farm Bureaus to organize the Cali-fornia Farm Bureau Marketing Association in 1918; starting a pilot program to sell tree-rip-ened fruit to southern California consumers in 1966; and playing a major role in the develop-ment and implementation of the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986. Today, the Farm Bureau is a grassroots, na- tionwide network of Farm Bureaus organized on county, state and national levels. The county Farm Bureau is the center of the orga-nization and is one of 53 county Farm Bu-reaus currently representing a combined mem-bership of over 4,000 family members in Fres-no County. Collectively, Farm Bureau is Cali-fornia’s largest farm organization with mem-berships from 76,500 farm families in 56 coun-ties. The Farm Bureau continues to lead the agri- culture industry and the community in ad-dressing issues that result in long-term viability for agriculture and promoting the economic vi-tality of the region. Farm Bureau spends countless hours researching agriculturally-re-lated legislation; testifying in front of local, state and federal government; and conducting meetings with elected officials. In addition, it fields hundreds of calls, providing education and outreach to the community, which has continued to be a centerpiece of the Farm Bu-reau. Through Coffee Talk meetings, which provide the opportunity for farmers to share in- formation in an informal setting and discuss current, local issues with special guest speak-ers, the Bureau has continued to make com-munity outreach a top priority. It is also in-volved in promoting the Blossom Trail, the Fruit Trail and the Big Fresno Fair, and annu-ally recognizes deserving reporters and editors for conveying accurate and objective reporting about agricultural issues and the industry. On top of these important efforts, the Farm Bureau offers valuable agriculture education and leadership development assistance in the community. The annual Farm and Nutrition Day is put on for more than 1,500 third-grad-ers, providing facts about food and fiber pro-duction in Fresno County. In addition, rep-resentatives from the Farm Bureau are on- hand during the annual Fair Education Pro-gram to conduct mini-presentations about agri-culture for students. The Fresno County Farm Bureau also works with local universities and conducts classroom presentations. In addition to this, the Future Advocates for Agriculture Concerned about Tomorrow (FAACT) Leader-ship Development Program provides commu-nity leaders with a comprehensive eight-month class, highlighting specific issue areas in agri-culture. FAACT offers a balanced, factual presentation of several issue areas specific to agriculture. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Fresno County Farm Bu-reau as it celebrates its 95th anniversary and prepares to continue to provide outstanding leadership for the agriculture industry through-out the Central Valley, the State of California, and our nation. f DORIT AND SHAWN EVENHAIM HON. HOWARD L. BERMAN OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to pay tribute to Dorit and Shawn Evenhaim for their generosity and dedication to help the less fortunate as well as provide the highest pos-sible quality of education in our community. Dorit and Shawn Evenhaim are Israeli Angelenos that own and operate California Home Builders. Both Dorit and Shawn grew up in Southern Israel where they learned the Jewish value of tzedakah, the act of charitable giving and helping the less fortunate. They came to the United States following their serv-ice in the Israeli military and continued to practice this philanthropy. They have contrib-uted countless hours of community service and provided leadership to many charitable or-ganizations throughout the San Fernando Val-ley such as the Israeli Leadership Council, the Jewish Federation, and StandWithUs. In 2004, Kadima, a 34-year-old Solomon Schecter Conservative day school in the West San Fernando Valley, had to relocate when LAUSD needed the campus that Kadima had been leasing. The Evenhaim’s generous dona-tion provided the resources for Kadima to pur-chase a former hospital about a mile away from the previous campus. The Evenhaim’s involvement did not end with their donation. They were also instru-mental in locating the site for the new campus, VerDate Mar 15 2010 03:50 Jun 29, 2012 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A28JN8.027 E28JNPT1smartinez on DSK6TPTVN1PROD with REMARKS

Kadima’s facilities now include separate yard spaces for the Early Childhood Education Center and Kindergarten, as well as athletic fields, an auditorium and swimming pool, ample classroom space, a 6,000 volume li-brary, and a full kitchen and cafeteria. Both Dorit and Shawn have done a great job serv-ing on Kadima’s Board of Trustees. Mr. Speaker and distinguished colleagues, I ask you to join me in recognizing Dorit and Shawn for their philanthropy and their years of service and dedication to the education and service of our community. f IN RECOGNITION OF UNITED WAY’S 125TH ANNIVERSARY HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to extend a heartfelt congratu-lations to the volunteers, employees and rep-resentatives of United Way as they celebrate 125 years of motivating millions of people to advance the common good. On June 21, 2012, the worldwide network celebrated their United Way Day of Action, a day dedicated to volunteer and community service activities and encouraging others to pledge to become readers, tutors, or mentors. Also, on June 28, 2012, they will be cele-brating the official United Way Founders Day, commemorating community leaders Frances Wisebart Jacobs, the Rev. Myron W. Reed, Msgr. William J. O’Ryan, Dean H. Martyn Hart and Rabbi William S. Friedman for founding the Charity Organizations Society, the first ‘‘United Way’’ Organization in Denver, Colo-rado in 1887. In 125 years, United Way has expanded be- yond Denver and Colorado and beyond the United States to become a network of almost 1,800 community-based United Ways in 45 countries and territories around the world. In as many years, United Way has become one of the biggest and most influential charity or-ganizations in the world. To emphasize this point, United Way, in a partnership with the National Football League (NFL), raised more than $1 billion dollars in 1974—the first time in history that an annual campaign of a single or-ganization had raised this much money. United Way envisions ‘‘a world where all in- dividuals and families achieve their human po-tential through education, income stability and healthy lives.’’ For this reason, in 2008, they set forth a 10-year program to achieve three goals by 2018: (1) Improve education and cut the number of high school dropouts (1.2 mil-lion students every year) in half; (2) help peo-ple achieve financial stability and get at least half of lower-income families (1.9 million fami-lies) on the way to economic independence; (3) promote healthy lives and increase by one- third the number of youth and adults who are healthy and avoid risky behaviors. These are ambitious goals but I am confident that the thousands of United Way advocates will work tirelessly to achieve them. I would like to especially recognize the local United Way organizations in Georgia’s Second Congressional District: Greater Valdosta United Way, Inc., United Way of South Central Georgia, United Way of Southwest Georgia, Bainbridge—Decatur United Way, United Way of Colquitt County, and United Way of the Chattahoochee Valley. I applaud the members and volunteers of these organizations for dedi-cating their time and efforts to support their neighbors in need. Mr. Speaker, in closing I ask that my col- leagues join me in expressing our collective and profound gratitude to the volunteers, em-ployees and representatives of United Way for all they have done to improve the quality of life for the residents of Georgia’s Second Con- gressional District and all around the world. f IN HONOR OF JOSEPH’S HOME HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Joseph’s Home, a safe, supportive envi-ronment for homeless individuals transitioning from local hospitals and other social service agencies following a period of illness or sur-gery. Cleveland has had a long history of organi- zations stepping up and caring for the less for-tunate. The Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine (CSA) arrived in Cleveland, Ohio from France in 1851 to serve as the city’s first public health nurses, laying the foundation for what would become Joseph’s House. The CSA quickly began providing the health and educational needs of Cleveland’s most impoverished and vulnerable residents. Over the past 160 years, the CSA has remained dedicated to address-ing the root causes of poverty and meeting the needs of the communities they serve. A group of CSA Sisters, led by founding Sisters Joan Gallagher and Regina Fierman, noticed that Greater Cleveland’s homeless community transitioning from local hospitals and other social service agencies following a period of illness or surgery did not have ac-cess to a safe and supportive environment. With a legacy of responding to the unmet needs of the community’s most vulnerable residents, the Sisters of Charity of St. Augus-tine opened the doors of Joseph’s Home in June 2000. Joseph’s House has helped over 400 men transition back into the world and has provided them with a second chance in life. Each year, around 50 men are helped; the house has a capacity of 11 men at any given time. The people served by Joseph’s House, leave it with the confidence and support that helps them succeed. Joseph’s House provides its residents with job opportunities, educational advancement and more importantly, a place to call home. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me in honoring Joseph’s House for its years of service and dedication to improving the lives of the less fortunate. A TRIBUTE TO BISHOP ALBERT L. JAMISON, SR. HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Bishop Albert L. Jamison, Sr. Bishop Albert L. Jamison, Sr. is a native of Brooklyn, New York. He serves as the distin-guished Pastor of Pleasant Grove Baptist Tab-ernacle where he holds the unique honor of pastoring in the church of which he was born and raised. He has taken his congregation to a new awareness of God. He is a nationally known evangelist, who travels across the United States to some of the largest cities and churches preaching the Gospel. He is the president and founder of ‘‘Pentecost At Any Cost’’ ministry. As a dedi-cated pastor and leader in the ministerial field, Bishop Jamison exemplifies a powerful Gospel music ministry. In 1970, Bishop Jamison began working with the late Reverend James Cleveland and continued working with him until the Lord called Rev. Cleveland home. While serving on the Board of Directors, Bishop Jamison was voted ‘‘Chairman’’ of the Board of Directors, March 1996. He has taken the world’s largest Gospel music organization, The Gospel Music Workshop of America, to new heights. He is the loving husband of Lady Dianette Jamison and the proud father of Jourdan Allen and Joshua Jermelle Jamison. His eldest son, Albert J. Jamison preceded him in death in January 2001. Because he dares to believe God, his life serves as an example to those he leads to de-velop a personal relationship with the Lord, to study the Word of God and to face the chal-lenges of life depending whole-heartedly in faith on the Lord. This way of life is expressed in one of his favorite scriptures found in II Co-rinthians 15:58—Therefore, my beloved breth-ren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Bishop Albert L. Jamison, Sr. for his extraor-dinary contributions to the Brooklyn commu-nity. f IN SUPPORT OF THE SUPREME COURT DECISION UPHOLDING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HON. LAURA RICHARDSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, after two years battling in the courts I am proud to an-nounce today that the Supreme Court has upheld the Affordable Care Act. This has been a long and difficult fight, but I can say without a doubt it has been worth it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1180 June 28, 2012 pre-existing conditions, and millions of young Americans will be able to stay on their par-ent’s healthcare plans until they are 26. The function of government is to make life better for all Americans, regardless of socio-economic background. The Affordable Care Act will improve the quality of life for working families, children and seniors. It will also strengthen our economy. President Obama is to be congratulated for his indispensable leadership in achieving the goal of affordable quality healthcare for all Americans, a goal we Democrats have been fighting for more than 75 years. It is a fact of life that individuals do not have a choice in participating in the health care market. Eventually we will all get sick, and need medical attention. This bill requires every American to take control of their own cov-erage, and be responsible for themselves. I am proud to have voted in favor of this legislation two years ago, and prouder still to have stood on the steps of the Supreme Court today to celebrate the success of having the Affordable Care Act upheld. Today’s ruling is a momentous occasion and a true victory for Americans across the nation. f REGARDING H. RES. 711 HON. EARL BLUMENAUER OF OREGON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today, I voted against the House Privileged Resolution holding Attorney General Eric Holder in con-tempt of Congress. Never in the 225 years of the House has there been a vote to hold any Cabinet member in contempt, and I will never vote to support such partisan legislation that’s nothing short of a race to the bottom for this House. There are serious questions that remain to be answered about the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) program, infa-mously know as ‘‘Fast and Furious,’’ started in 2005 under the Bush administration. The De-partment of Justice is in the midst of such an investigation, but today’s vote will do nothing to further that inquiry, and will instead slow and muddle the process. The charges by Chairman I SSA of a con- spiratorial effort by the Obama administration to strengthen gun control laws—are com-pletely unsubstantiated and laughable on their face. When that became apparent, the Chair-man turned to blatant political tactics, culmi-nating in a Contempt of Congress resolution that was rushed to the floor. The Republicans and the National Rifle As- sociation have created a web of constraints that make it almost impossible to restrict these dangerous practices that prompted the pro-gram in the first place. Fast and Furious was a flawed operation. Those flaws, however, parallel the biased, po-liticized investigation run by House Oversight & Investigations Committee Republicans. Dur-ing the Committee’s 16–month investigation, they refused all Democratic requests for wit- nesses and hearings. The investigation was closed to the public. The Republican refusal to even allow those directly involved with the Fast & Furious pro-gram to testify before the Oversight Com-mittee portrays their political motivations, not the facts, nor the thousands of innocent civil-ians in Mexico and on the border who have lost their lives from heavily-armed drug cartels. Attorney General Holder testified before the Committee nine times. The Department of Justice provided over 700 thousand docu-ments to the House Oversight & Investigations Committee. Despite this broad cooperation, my Republican colleagues kept moving the goal posts, making it impossible to meet their demands. There was no end in sight. Presi-dent Obama’s decision to assert executive privilege was a well-reasoned decision to stop playing the Republicans political game. I believe deeply in the fundamental respon- sibility of Congress to provide oversight and accountability for the executive branch. We only weaken that authority by engaging in this partisan stunt Congress and the American people deserve better. We should reject this effort and do our job to find out what really happened. f IN MEMORY OF BISHOP ROBERT C. JEFFERSON HON. AL GREEN OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, June 28, 2012 Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor the memory of a pillar in the Sunnyside community in Houston, Texas, Bishop Robert C. Jefferson, Pastor of the Cullen Missionary Baptist Church. With excep-tional dedication, Bishop Jefferson served his community and advocated for the betterment of society. Bishop Jefferson was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on January 12, 1942. He accepted his calling into the gospel ministry in March 1976 and was ordained at Mount Horeb Bap-tist Church in Houston under the pastoral leadership of the late Reverend Johnnie Jones. In March 1977, he founded Cullen Mis-sionary Baptist Church and faithfully served there for the rest of his life. A champion of the downtrodden and under- served, Bishop Jefferson founded and was ac-tive on a host of community organizations. He was a Founding Member of Ministers Against Crime, an organization that is active in issues involving inequities and civil rights in the Greater Houston Area. He was also the Founder of Sunnyside Up, Inc., a community development project; Founder/President of A Brand New City, Inc; Founder/President of the Cullen Christian Child Development Center; the former Second Vice President and Director of Religious Affairs of the NAACP Houston Branch; and a former member of the Houston Independent School District Board. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Bishop Jefferson will be dearly missed by his wife, Myrtle, grand-children, great-grandchildren, as well as his four daughters, Lola, Vanessa, Lisa and Robertine. He will be remembered in the City of Houston as a dedicated community leader and a principled man of God. f A TRIBUTE TO DR. SWAMY SUNKARA HON.

He gave free anesthesia for surgeries of children with cleft palates, club-foot, and other congenital abnormalities.

Dr. Sunkara also served as one of the Uncles for foster children of Richard Allen Center on Life in New York City. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Dr. Swamy Naidu Sunkara for his extraordinary contributions to New York City’s medical com-munity.
