Summer 2006 Five Rivers Environmental Education Center ______________________________________ (518) 475-0291______________________________________ www.dec.state.ny.us/website/education /5rivers.html Some Pig All kids seem to love Charlotte’s Web, the classic children’s story by E. B. White, of Wilbur the pig and his faithfulfriend Charlotte the spider. Even kids whohaven’t read the book have seen the movieand know that Charlotte is loving, wise andresourceful. To save Wilbur from his fate asbacon, she spins the immortal words “SomePig” with webbing over his sty, andeventually makes him the world’s mostfamous farm animal. Spiders don’t really do that, needless to say. And everyone seems to hate spiders.Most people reach for a can of bug spray atthe sight of a spider, or like Garfield, flattenthe spider with one stamp. But spiders arecommon enough in agricultural fields thatthey seriously reduce the numbers of insectpests. The financial benefit of spiders to pestcontrol is estimated at over one milliondollars per year in New York State alone.Spiders eat insects–they’re not looking forhumans to bite. Dangerously venomousspiders are rare in New York State; few ofus will ever even see one. August is the month of orb weavers, the big, beautiful gold-and-black spiders that 5rivers@dec.state.ny.us spin round webs in the fields and gardens. There’s no need to fear them, they’reharmless to people and will help controlpests in the garden. To find out more about spiders, join us on a Spider Search onAugust 22 at 7:00 PM. You might not loveevery creepy-crawly spider you see out inthe meadow--but try to see a little Charlottein her. –Anita Sanchez (Thanks to former Naturalist Intern AndyFyfe for spider research.)
