Fugh­Berman, A Continuing medical education (CME) is the pharmaceutical industry’s most important marketing tool. T he development of marketing messages for a drug starts seven to ten years before a drug is submitt ed for FDA approval. Many of the marketing messages that are developed fo r each product do not mention the drug at all. A ‘pre- launch’ marketing message might emphasize the importance of a s pecific physiologic process in order to set the stage for accept ance of a drug that a ffects that mechanism, or might create an unnecessary diagnostic distin ction in order to establish a niche for a drug entering a crowded market. Selling disease CME is used to sell drugs by selling di seases. As a marketing article called “Proving the case for investing in CME,” states:“The most significant benefits for industry may include creating diseas e-state awareness and disease state significance.” i1 Another marketing article notes that:“CME activities are most valuable in introducing products early in their life cycles or for promoting mature brands with new indications and new clinical data.”2 Industry-funded CME often emphasizes the se verity or prevalence of specific conditions in order to prepar e, or expand, a market.3 Manipulating physicians’ understanding of the prevalence or severity of medical conditions can lead to overtreatment, and expose patient s to the adverse effects of drugs without significant benefit. The marketing messages imbedded in CME lectures, articles, on-line modules, and tests are never advertisements for a spec ific therapy because physicians will reject speakers or articles that obviously favor a specific drug. One marketing message might emphasize the risks of compet ing therapies; another the lack of evidence regarding an over-the-counter remedy. CME is often used to promote unproven uses of a drug. While it is illegal for a drug company to promote off-label use of a drug, CME is not cons idered promotion and is not regulated by the FDA. Physicians can say whatever they want, so are used as mouthpieces for marketing messages that woul d be illegal coming from a company rep. The academic physicians involved in industry-funded CME may protest, quite honestly, that they are ex pressing their independent opinions. However, they are chosen because what they are saying aligns with a product’s marketing messages, and as they do so. are supported only as long 4 A physician who expresses doubts about a Raichle L. Proving the case for investing in CME . Medical Marketing & Media. Jun 1998; 1 33(6): 84.

Fugh­Berman, A product’s efficacy, concerns about its risks, or enthusiasm for a competing therapy will be unceremoniously dropped from a company’s speaker’s bureau. Vetting bias in CME modules There is little incentive for medi cal education and communication (MEC) companies or academic medical centers to at tempt to ferret out bias in CME modules, because both depend on industry for survival. In 2007, about half of the $2.5 billion spent on CME came from pharmaceutical m anufacturers. Seventy-two percent of the income from events sponsored by medical education companies is from firms that manufacture FDA-regulated products. Academic medical centers are only a little better; 57% of CME income to medical schools comes from industry. Although academic CME providers do their best to vet industry-funded modules for bias, such review focuses on the detecti on of obvious advertising, the use of brand rather than generic names, of drugs, and adequate disclosure of conflict of interest. No matter how vigilant they are, CME provider s are not trained in recognizing marketing messages and cannot adequately assess indus try-funded materi als for bias. As previously noted, marketing begins years before a drug reaches the market. Adequate vetting of CME modules would require knowledge of every drug, biologic, device, and diagnostic test that every company is marketing, developing, or considering. The task becomes even more daunting when mergers, acquisitions, co-marketing agreements and collaborative marketing arrangements for example, among companies selling drugs in the same class) are tak en into account. Similarly, disclosures of financial conflicts of interest are impo ssible to interpret without knowing every company’s marketing plan for every drug on the market or in the pipeline. ‘Unrestricted’ grants Unrestricted educational grants to academ ic medical centers or MECs are no solution. Although the new PhRMA Code of Ethics does not allow sponsors (companies that fund the event) to suggest speakers, sponsors may indicate which topics they are interested in funding. “Unrestricted” grants provided for grand rounds and lunch conferences depend on a sense of obligation ra ther than a quid pro quo. When lists of recommended speakers are supplied to organize rs, it is unstated, but nonetheless understood, that company-paid speakers will be included in the lecture series. The organizing board of the CME program may includ e speakers selected and paid by the sponsor. The desired messages about particular products or diseases may be made clear. Organizers understand that sponsors or exhibito rs may withdraw if they don’t like the content. Not every speaker in a lecture series or conference is chosen by industry. Pharmaceutical companies refer to presentations with ma rketing messages as “message talks,” and sponsored CME programs usually include talks that are not connected with the sponsor’s product. Although these camouflage talks may involve independent speakers, organizers know that they must avoid inviting speakers who might criticize a sponsor’s products or oppose a sponsor’s marketing messages Physicians will never hear about how a ta rgeted disease is overdiagnosed or overtreated at a sponsored event. And rarely will they hear positive recommendations 3

ACCME The ACCME Standards for Commercial Support5 to discourage potential conflicts of interest are both weak and ignored. A 2007 annual report by the ACCME, however, showed that 29% of providers failed to comply with Standard 2, which requires that any individuals that control cont ent of a CME activity disclose and resolve conflicts of interest.6 27% of the providers did not comp ly with Standard 3, which includes guidelines to prevent those with commercial inte rest from dictating the content of a CME activity. And 36% of providers were noncomp liant with Standard 6, wh ich requires that all commercial support and financial relationships of authors be disclosed to CME participants before the activity. 6 The ACCME does not screen CME activi ties, and does not encourage audience members to report commercial bas. Although written complaints are accepted, the process is burdensome The ACCME would not tell us whether or not any providers have lost accreditation status due to comm ercial bias. Losing accreditation for any reason is rare; according to the annual reports published by the ACCME only one provider lost accr editation in 2005. Conclusion If sponsoring CME events did not increase product sales, drug companies would not do it. The large amount of commercial suppor t poured into CME is in itself testimony that industry believes supporting CME is cost-effective. I ndustry influence on medical discourse limits the discussion to the most profitable therapies, which may not be best for patients. Industry-funded medical educ ation is a contradiction in terms. ### Acknowledgments: Alicia Bell MS, Mar garet Infeld, Clare Murphy, Stephanie Waterhouse, and Nicole Woodard provided background research.
