INTRODUCTION The Centre for Humanit arian Da ta centre.humda ta.org | Join our mailing lis t bit.ly/humd atamailing | T witter @humdat a | Email c entrehumd ata@un. org In our fourth ye ar of producing /gid00021/gid00035/gid00032/gid00001/gid00020/gid00047 /gid00028/gid00047/gid00032/gid00001/gid00042/gid00033/gid00001/gid00016/gid00043/gid00032/gid00041/gid00001/gid00009/gid00048/gid00040/gid00028/gid00041/gid00036/gid00047 /gid00028/gid00045/gid00036/gid00028/gid00041/gid00001/gid00005/gid00028/gid00047 /gid00028, we can report the highes t levels yet for da ta availability across priority humanit arian oper ations. These g ains can be attribut ed to the c ommitment of organiz ations to sharing and maint aining their da ta publicly . There was also strong demand for da ta about the world’ s lar gest humanit arian crises, from the war in Ukr aine to drought and food insecurity in the Horn of Africa. Our under standing of da ta availability and use c omes from managing the Humanit arian Da ta Exchang e (HD X), an open pla tform for finding and sharing da ta across crises and org aniz ations./one.sups In 2022, HD X was used by 1.5 million people in 233 c ountries and t errit ories, an incre ase of 8 perc ent c omp ared with 2021. Org aniz ations added 3,700 new and upd ated da tasets, bringing the total to more than 20,400 da tasets, which were downlo aded over 1.8 million times. Although HD X includes da ta about all c ountries in the world, we c onc entr ate here on 25 loca tions with humanit arian response plans (HRPs)./two.sups In 2022, 32 perc ent of all da tasets downlo aded from HD X were related to an HRP loca tion./three.sups At the st art of 2023, we es timate tha t 73 perc ent of relev ant, c omple te crisis da ta is av ailable across 25 humanit arian oper ations, b ased on the analysis of the HD X Da ta Grids (see crit eria below). If we add the da ta tha t is relev ant but inc omplet e, the tot al is 93 perc ent. This le aves 7 perc ent of ca tego ries with da ta tha t does no t meet the crit eria or with no da ta. The 25 Da ta Grids include 459 unique da tasets, with a r ang e of 13-22 da tasets per loca tion. https:// data.humda ta.org/ HRPs are prep ared by UN Humanit arian Countr y Te ams in loca tions where there is an ong oing humanit arian emerg enc y. HRPs are g ener ally prep ared annually , and outline an over all st rate gy and specific activities for e ach humanit arian clus ter or sec tor. We use Mixp anel, a third-p arty analytics ser vice, to under stand the behavior of users on the HD X plat form. We do no t send identifying informa tion to Mixp anel. 1 2 3/gid00004/gid00042/gid00040/gid00043/gid00039/gid00032 /gid00047/gid00032 /gid00010/gid00041/gid00030/gid00042/gid00040/gid00043/gid00039/gid00032 /gid00047/gid00032 /gid00015/gid00042/gid00001/gid00005/gid00028 /gid00047/gid00028 /gid00005/gid00028/gid00047/gid00028/gid00001/gid00030/gid00042/gid00040/gid00043/gid00039/gid00032/gid00047 /gid00032/gid00041/gid00032/gid00046/gid00046/gid0114320%7% 73%Total Pe rcentage Data Complet e 73%Total Pe rcentage Data Inc omplet e 20 %Total Pe rcentage No Data 7% This report c ontains det ails on the da ta available for e ach loca tion, c atego ry and sub-c atego ry covered in the Da ta Grids as of 31 Dec ember 2022. It includes a c ountr y deep-dive for South Sudan and showcases the work of the Humanit arian OpenS treetMap Team (HO T) on c ommunity mapping. It also provides examples of how clim ate impa ct da ta is being used to predict the imp acts of a haz ard on lives and livelihoods and trigg er actions to mitig ate them. /gid00005/gid00028/gid00047/gid00028/gid00001/gid00008/gid00045/gid00036/gid00031/gid00001/gid00004/gid00045/gid00036/gid00047 /gid00032/gid00045/gid00036/gid00028 The HD X Da ta Grids narr ow the focus within ea ch HR P loc ation to a limited se t of foundational da ta needed to underst and a humanit arian c ontex t. They pr ovide a c omp arable wa y to assess da ta availability across locations and categories and are the ba sis for the analysis in this report . The Da ta Grids include six categories: aﬀected people; c oordination and c ontex t; food security and nutrition; geogr aphy and infr astructure; he alth and education; and population and socio-ec onomy . (See Annex A for definitions.)

54 5Data may be included in a Dat a Grid if it is r elevant to the categ ory and sub-national. The da ta is considered ‘comple te’ if it has br oad geogr aphic c overage, is shared in a c ommonly used forma t, and is up- to-date. If any of those criteria are not me t, then it is c onsidered ‘inc omple te’. The sub-categ ory is c omple te if it includes at le ast one da taset that is comple te. If the sub-categ ory contains only inc omple te datasets, then that sub-categ ory is c onsidered inc omple te. A sub-categ ory is empty if no da ta mee ts the above criteria or the da ta does not exist on HD X. (See Annex B for the Da ta Grid criteria and cur ation proc ess.) In 2022, HD X maint ained Da ta Grids for 25 locations and 20 sub-categ ories. The number of locations decr eased by two from 2021 given that Zimb abwe a nd Pakistan no long er had humanit arian response plans in 2022. Two sub-categ ories were removed – tr ansport ation st atus and aﬀected ar eas – and one was added for climate imp act. (See Anne x C for chang es to the Da ta Grids.) We rec ognize the v aluable c ontributions of all da ta-sharing org anizations publishing da ta on HD X, and in particular the 18 org anizations tha t populate the Da ta Grids, with referenc e to 175 da ta sourc es. Da tasets included in the Da ta Grids are downlo aded almos t five times more than the aver age da taset on HD X./four.sups T rusted partnerships and focused advocacy efforts have led t o many new or upd ated da tasets in the Da ta Grids this y ear, including: • Glob al malnutrition prev alenc e rates disaggreg ated by provinc e in Af ghanis tan, c ontribut ed by OCHA Afghanist an and sourc ed to UNICEF ./five.sups • The number of displac ed people by sub-prefecture in the Centr al African Republic (CAR), v alida ted by the Commission des Mouvements de P opula tion and shared by OCHA CAR./six.sups • The imp act of floods with disrup tion t o aﬀect ed popula tions, des troyed infr astructure and veg etation in Nig er, contribut ed by OCHA Nig er and sourc ed to the Minis tère de l' Action Humanit aire et de la Ges tion des Catastrophes du Nig er./seven.sups • Educa tion f acilities by type and loca tion in Somalia, c ompiled by UNICEF and c ontribut ed by OCHA Somalia./eight.sups • Sub-na tional sex and ag e disaggreg ated popula tion s tatistics for Sudan with upda ted projections for 2022, contribut ed by UNFP A and sourc ed to the Centr al Bure au of S tatistics for Sudan./nine.sups There were dozens of high-v alue da tasets av ailable on HD X throughout 2022 tha t go beyond the sc ope of the Data Grids.

KEY MESSAGE S • The av ailability of co re da ta for priority humanit arian oper ations is at its highes t levels in the past four ye ars, but g aps remain with clim ate imp act da ta, acut e malnutrition prev alenc e and ac cess c onstraints, among other are as. • Sinc e 2019, when the Da ta Grids were fir st introduc ed on HD X, we have seen an incre ase in da ta complet eness from 54 perc ent to 73 perc ent in loca tions with humanit arian response plans. The ca tego ries with no da ta have f allen from 25 perc ent to 7 perc ent (see chart below). • These g ains can be attribut ed to the st rong c ommitment of org aniz ations to sharing and maint aining their data publicly through the HD X pla tform. • There was strong demand for da ta about the world’ s larg est humanit arian crises, from the war in Ukr aine to drought and food insecurity in the Horn of Africa. Da ta covering Ukr aine, E thiopia and Nig eria was the mos t downlo aded in 2022. • In 2022, HD X was used by 1.5 million people in 233 countries and t errit ories. Around 1.8 million da tasets were downlo aded throughout the ye ar. • We es timate tha t 73 perc ent of relev ant, c omple te crisis da ta is av ailable across 25 loca tions with humanit arian oper ations, b ased on the analysis of the HD X Da ta Grids. If we add the da ta tha t is relev ant but incomplet e, the tot al is 93 perc ent. This le aves about 7 perc ent of the Da ta Grids with no da ta. • Over two dozen new org aniz ations joined HD X in 2022, bringing the tot al to almos t 300 org aniz ations. Eight een org aniz ations c ontribut e da ta tha t is included in the Da ta Grids. • The 25 Da ta Grids included 459 unique da tasets, with a r ang e of 13-22 da tasets per loca tion. Da tasets included in the Da ta Grids are downlo aded almos t five times more than the aver age da taset on HD X. • South Sudan, Af ghanis tan and Somalia have the mos t comple te Data Grids. V enezuela, Syria and Lib ya are the countries with the lar gest data gaps. • The mos t comple te Data Grid sub-c ateg ories are funding, adminis trative divisions, b aseline popula tion, IDPs, refug ees and persons of c onc ern, and food pric es, owing to the work of OCHA, UNFP A, IOM, UNHCR, and WFP . • Humanit arian crises are dynamic and so is the da ta needed to under stand them. The av ailability and complet eness of da ta will fluctu ate year-to-ye ar as new da ta requirements c ome int o focus. • A priority for 2023 will be a c ontinued focus on clim ate imp act da ta, which is essential for under standing and predicting the future imp acts of haz ards on vulner able popula tions. We will also explore implementing da ta quality gr ades or sc ores for some da tasets included in the Da ta Grids.

ORGANIZATION DEEP-DIVE: HUMANITARIAN OPENSTREETMAP TEAM The Humanit arian OpenS treetMap Team, known by its acronym HO T, supports humanit arian action and community development through open mapping. When disas ter strike s anywhere in the world, HO T is able to mobilize thousands of volunt eers who c ome to gether online and on the ground to create open da ta that enables disas ter responders to reach those in need. The da ta is derived from a crowdsourcing model tha t leve rages OpenS treetMap (OSM), a free, open sourc e, edit able map of the world. The da ta is contribut ed to OSM in one of three ways : • In-person, mobile da ta collection tha t is focused on the loca tion of specific infr astructure, such as educa tion and he alth f acilities. • Remo te sensing and digitiz ation from s atellit e imag ery or unmanned aerial vehicles to create building and ro ad da tasets . • Importing exis ting da tasets from g overnments and org aniz ations. Given their c ommitment to open sour ce data and t ools, HO T became one of the fir st organizations to join HD X when it launched in 2014. Sinc e then, they have added over 4,400 da tasets covering 249 countries and t errit ories, which currently a ccounts for about 20 perc ent of all da ta on HD X. The da ta includes the essential ingredients for map making: ro ad networks; popul ated plac es; airport, r ailways and port loc ations; educa tion and he alth facilities; and rivers and w aterways. These det ails are critical for humanit arians to under stand the physical geogr aphy and infr astructure of a c ountr y, and this da ta is consis tently among the mos t downlo aded on HD X. The humanita rian open mapping c ommunity , which is currently es timated to be around 423,000 people from around the world, is c ontinuously upda ting the da ta on OpenS treetMap. The HO T and HD X teams re alized early on tha t it would be impossible to keep the da tasets on HD X up -to-da te without an aut omated proc ess. In 2016, we work ed to gether to build an ex tension to the HO T Export T ool – called the HO T Bo t – which sends the da ta to HDX on a regular cycle. This elimin ates the c omplex t ask of c onfiguring a cus tom export in the HO T Ex port T ool and pre-p ackag es the da ta in c ommon GIS da ta forma ts broken down by countr y and region. The da tasets export ed by HO T are included in the Da ta Grids if they are deemed to be the bes t available sour ce for a sub-c atego ry. This de termina tion is made by the HD X team in c ollabor ation with the Informa tion Manag ement Working Group in e ach c ountr y. In 2022, da ta attribut ed to HOT was included in the Da ta Grids for nine countries covering three sub-categories – airports, populated plac es and ro ads.

For HO T, data quality is a primar y conc ern. Additions and improvements are contribut ed by a lar ge number of partners in the humanit arian and development sp ace, as well as commercial partners using OSM da ta in their workflows and products. To complement exis ting da ta valida tion, HO T and HD X are working to provide additional insights int o fa ctors such as da ta accuracy and c omplet eness. In 2022, the da ta export ed by HO T to HDX was downlo aded almos t 67,000 times by users in 194 countries and territ ories. Ro ad network da ta for Af ghanis tan, E thiopia and Pa kistan were among the mos t popular . Da tasets shared by HO T will c ontinue to be in high demand at the onset of a new crisis, providing firs t responders with the geogr aphical awareness tha t is essential for humanit arian action. We are gr ateful to Humanit arian OpenS treetMap for being a s teadf ast da ta sharing p artner .

CLIMATE IMPACT DATA The Centre for Humanit arian Da ta centre.humda ta.org | Join our mailing lis t bit.ly/humd atamailing | T witter @humdat a | Email c entrehumd ata@un. org The most significant chang e to the Da ta Grids in 2022 was the inclusion of a new sub-ca tego ry for clim ate imp act data. This da ta should c ontain the current and his torical im pacts of climate event s rela ting to floods, droughts and st orms, as well as their loca tion, date and imp act on aﬀect ed popula tions, infr astructure and/ or ve geta tion. By the end of the ye ar, this sub-c atego ry was 68 perc ent c omple te with da ta missing for seven countries with humanit arian oper ations. With the climate crisis int ensifying emerg encies around the world, humanit arians are incre asingly having to incorpor ate climate data and foreca sts int o their analysis and planning. This is especially the case for antici pato ry action, which relies on models to predict the imp acts of a ha zard on lives and livelihoods and trigger actions to mitig ate them. Sinc e 2019, the Centre has support ed OCHA ’s anticipato ry action pilo ts for various haz ards in twelve countries. This has r ang ed from drought in Chad and Somalia to floods in Nep al and Bangladesh. Our t echnical support involves c onducting his torical analysis of the haz ard and its im pact, assessing av ailable models and foreca sts, and designing trigg er mechanisms for the rele ase of funds. By the end of 2022, the UN Centr al Emerg ency Response F und had rele ased $89 million in funding for antici pato ry action b ased on trigg er mechanisms developed by the Centre and OCHA oﬀic es. Three types of clim ate data are used to build, ev aluate and v alidate trigg er mechanisms: • da ta on wha t happened (the haz ard) • da ta on the damag e (the imp act) • da ta on wha t is lik ely to happen ne xt (the foreca st) The da ta tha t is mos t o/f_t en missing for this analysis is the imp act da ta. Without it, we are no t able to model the expect ed imp acts of future shocks. As an example, in Nig er we used household sur vey da ta to under stand the imp act of se asonal r ainf all levels on livelihoods. On ce we under stood this, we were able to use se asonal r ainf all foreca sts to inform humanit arian partners about the lik ely imp act of a below aver age se ason. Similarly , in the Philippines we work ed with the Netherlands Red Cross to use his torical typhoon tr ack and r ainf all da ta to train a model tha t estimate s housing damag e caused by typhoons. This model is now being used to estimate the expec ted impa ct based on typhoon forecasts provided by meteorological institutions. A historical typhoon impact dat aset, c overing 2014 to 2020, is now av ailable on HD X. By the end of 2022, eight een climate imp act da tasets had been added to HDX and the Da ta Grids, in c ollabor ation with OCHA oﬀic es and p artners. A few examples include: • Moz ambique: Da ta on the number of people aﬀect ed by cyclones at the dis trict level from 2016 to 2022, shared by OCHA Moz ambique and produc ed by Ins titut o Nacional de Ges tão e Redução do Ris co de Desas tres . • Mali: Da ta on the number of people aﬀect ed, houses des troyed, w ater and sanita tion infr astructure damag ed and livestock lost as the results of seasonal floods, shared and maint ained by OCHA Mali . • Burundi: Da ta on the imp act from floods and he avy ra ins on popula tions, infr astructure and/ or ve geta tion, shared by IOM via OCHA Burundi. https:/ /centre.humda ta.org /anticip atory-action/ The $89 million has been alloc ated for drought in Nig er, Somalia and E thiopia; for flooding in Bangladesh, South Sudan and Ne pal; and for choler a in the Democr atic Republic of the Cong o. https:/ /centre.humda ta.org /peer -review-of -510s-typhoon-model-and-its-use-in-the-philippines / https:// data.humda ta.org /dataset/philippines-typhoon-imp act-data-2014-2020 https:// data.humda ta.org /dataset/imp act-of-cyclones-2016-to-2022 https:// data.humda ta.org /dataset/mali-suivi-des-inondations https:// data.humda ta.org /dataset/burundi-emerg encies-tr acking-tool-e tt22 23 24 2522 23 24 25 26 27 28 262728

CONCLUSIO N BURUNDI: CLIMA TE IMP ACT TRENDS 2018-2022 Beyond the Da ta Grids, we are also looking to mak e a wider set of clima te data more ac cessible to the HD X community . For example, WFP rec ently shared e arth obser vation da tasets on r ainf all and ve geta tion he alth covering 33 c ountries with either a humanit arian response plan or an anticip ator y action fr amework . With this data, humanit arians can assess current drought c onditions and also analy ze historical trends to anticipate the impa ct of r ainy se asons. Despit e this progress, clim ate imp act da ta remains scar ce for certain types of climate shocks and loca tions and the his torical time period is o/f_t en limit ed. In the ye ar ahe ad, we plan to share pr actical guidanc e on how to interpret and use c ommon foreca sts, such as se asonal r ainf all foreca sts or riverine flood projections. And we are developing t ools to mak e it e asier for humanit arians to use climate data.

26ANNEX B: INCLUSION OF DATA IN THE DATA GRID S Data Grid cur ation involves the careful ev alua tion of da tasets on HD X for inclusion in one or more of the sub-c ateg ories in acco rdanc e with our st andard crit eria. The HD X team c onducts this ev alua tion when a da taset is newly added or upd ated on HD X. The HD X team supports the Da ta Grids in three ways: Reviewing whether any da taset on HD X could be added to a Da ta Grid; Conducting targeted outreach with humanit arian org aniz ations to find relev ant da tasets; and Identifying po tential da tasets with p artners in the rese arch c ommunity , academia and/ or g overnment ag encies. The fir st step in det ermining whether a da taset should be included in a Da ta Grid is to check whether the da taset meets the thema tic requirement defined in Annex A. Da tasets tha t are no t considered relev ant are aut oma tically excluded. The sec ond st ep is to det ermine if the da taset is sub-na tional. To fulfill this requirement the da ta mus t be disaggreg ated to at least the fir st adminis trative division. If the da ta is only av ailable at the na tional level, it is typically ex cluded. The sub-na tional requirement has been partially or c omplet ely waived for three da tasets: UNHCR’ s da ta on forcibly displac ed popula tions and stat eless persons; OCHA FT S’s requirements and funding data; and IA TI activities da ta. The third step is to assess whether a thema tically rele vant, sub-na tional da ta set is c omple te or inc omplet e. A dataset is c onsidered c omple te if it sa tisfies all of the following crit eria: Bro ad g eogr aphic c overage; Av ailable in c ommonly used forma ts; and Timely (full definitions are given below). If the da taset does no t satisfy one or more of these crit eria, it is c onsidered inc omplet e. Finally , the da taset is c omp ared ag ains t exis ting da tasets for tha t loca tion to determine if it should be added to the Da ta Grid. If the sub-c atego ry is emp ty, or if the da ta would c omplement o ther da tasets in a sub-c atego ry, the HDX team will add it to the Da ta Grid. A c omplement ary da taset is one tha t adds unique and useful informa tion to the sub-c atego ry. The IA TI da tasets are a g ood example of a c omplement ary da taset as they add unique and useful informa tion to the 3W sub-c atego ry. Ano ther example is a da taset tha t provides da ta for a geogr aphic ar ea not covered by the exis ting da taset. If there is alre ady a c omple te dataset av ailable for the sub-c atego ry, the HD X team will re ach out to in-c ountr y partners to det ermine which da taset is being used oper ationally and tha t da taset will be included in the Da ta Grid. The sub-c atego ry is considered c omple te if it has at least one c omple te dataset av ailable for the sub-c ateg ory. If the sub-c atego ry contains only inc omple te datasets, then tha t sub-c ateg ory is c onsidered inc omplet e. Over all catego ry complet eness refers to the proportion of sub-c atego ries in the c atego ry tha t are c omplet e. Similarly , complet eness for a loca tion refers to the proportion of sub-c atego ries tha t are c omple te in the loc ation. Sub-c ateg ories are c onsidered emp ty if no da tasets on HD X meet the above-mentioned crit eria. In g ener al, da ta can be missing for three re asons:32 See Annex C of The St ate of Open Humani tarian Da ta 2022 for the information on the decision-making proc ess for sub-national da taset waiver s: https://bit.ly/3YbK eDM32 The Centre for Humanit arian Da ta centre.humda ta.org | Join our mailing lis t bit.ly/humd atamailing | T witter @humdat a | Email c entrehumd ata@un. org

It is no t collect ed (e.g., because nobody is present to do so, because it is unsafe to access are as to collect it, because it requires inves tment and resourc es tha t are no t available, or because nobody prioritizes it as a g ap to fill). It is c ollect ed but no t publicly shared (e.g., because the c ollecting org aniz ation does no t have an open da ta polic y, because the da ta is sensitive and should no t be shared, because the c ollecting entity fe ars sharing the da ta with ac tors they do no t know and trus t, or bec ause of a lack of resourc es to clean and share it). It is c ollect ed and shared but is no t shared on HD X, or known about by the HD X team. DETAILED COMPLETENESS CRITERI A The crit eria for ev alua ting c omplet eness for relev ant, sub-na tional da ta are det ailed below: Does the da ta have bro ad g eogr aphic c ove rage with e xplicit loca tion informa tion ? • Is the da taset g eogr aphically c omprehensive, or as c omprehensive as possible? If the da taset is disaggreg ated by adminis trative divisions, does it c over all of them? If it does no t, is the me aning of a missing adminis trative division defined in the met ada ta? If there is no c omprehensive lis t to comp are ag ains t (for example, with spont aneous displac ement loca tions), does the da taset mak e it cle ar if it att emp ts to be c omprehensive or no t? • Are loca tion referenc es defined? The da taset should c ontain explicit g eogr aphic da ta (i.e., Geogr aphic Informa tion Sys tem da ta or t abular da ta with la titude and longitude fields). If no t, the da taset should be joinable to an av ailable da taset tha t defines those loca tions. Is the da ta in c ommonly-used forma ts? • Is it st ored in a c ommon file forma t? We include CS V, XLS, XL SX, SHP , GEO JSON, et c. Fo rmat s lik e GPK G and o thers tha t are more diﬀicult for the typical humanit arian da ta specialis t would be mark ed ‘inc omple te.’ • Is the da ta tidy? Field names and da ta rows should be e asy to det ermine. There should no t be sub -total rows int erspersed with da ta rows. The required da ta for the ca tego ry should be in a single t able on the same ta b. For t abular da ta with c oordin ates, the x and y c olumns (usually longitude and la titude) should be in decimal degree forma t and sep arated int o two columns. Is the da ta timely? • Has the da taset bec ome out of date ? Depending on how frequently the da taset is expect ed to be updated, the HD X team c onsiders the ag e of the da ta and whether the da taset should have been superseded.

The Da ta Grid Governanc e Group discusses the feedb ack tha t we rec eive and mak es decisions around chang es to the Da ta Grids. In 2022, the Da ta Grid Governanc e Group met three times and approved the following chang es: 1) Adding a sub-c atego ry for clim ate imp act We exp anded the Da ta Grids to include a new sub-c atego ry for clima te imp act which c overs current and his torical hazards and their imp act on people, infr astructure and/ or ve geta tion. Re ad more about this decision in our blog post from November 2022. 2) Removing sub-c ateg ories for tr ansport ation sta tus and aﬀect ed are as a. Tr ansport ation st atus : The diﬀerenc e between the tr ansporta tion sta tus and ro ads sub-c ateg ories was o/f_t en uncle ar. In more than 35 perc ent of loca tions, the same da taset was used for bo th sub-c atego ries. b. Aﬀected areas : The definition for the aﬀect ed are as sub-c ateg ory focused on the type and/ or severity of g eogr aphical imp acts. This was int erpret ed diﬀerently across loca tions, making it an inc onsis tent me asure for da ta availability . When the sub-c atego ry was c omplet e, it was a mix of da ta on the imp act of climate events and the severity es timates included in a Humanit arian Needs Over view da taset. 33 https:/ /centre.humda ta.org /prioritizing-climate-imp act-data/33
