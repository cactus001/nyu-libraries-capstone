(January 12, 2007) Posting on The Hill Blog January 12, 2007 http://blog.thehill.com/2007/01/12/a-good-deal-for-seniors/ A Good Deal for Seniors January 12th, 2007 All Americans are struggling with the ever-increasing costs of health care, but seniors have been especially hard hit. I have fought for this change in Medicare since I was first elected, so I'm very happy that we were able to pass this bill today that will help seniors get more affordable health care. Medicare beneficiaries were done a disservice when the Medicare Prescription Drug bill passed with a provision that prohibited the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating prices with drug manufacturers. Today we fixed that. Negotiating for better prescription drug prices is a long overdue step toward making health care more affordable for Medicare beneficiaries. I am proud to have helped pass this bipartisan legislation and I look forward to continuing to work for better and more affordable health care for our seniors.
