California Regional Water Quality Control Board North Coast Region Monitoring and Reporting Program No. R1-2003-0051 (Revised December 18,2003) for Southern Humboldt Unified School District ' Whitethorn Elementary School 1685 1 Briceland-Thorn Road Whitethorn, CA Humboldt County MONITORING The presence of floating product shall be evaluated in each monitoring well quarterly. If detected, the thickness shall be measured to at least 0.01 foot increments. The depth to groundwater in all monitoring wells shall be determined to at least 0.01 foot increments quarterly. The results of each quarter's elevation shall be reported in tabular form indicating the surveyed elevations of each well reference point, depth to groundwater from referencipoint, and the actual groundwater elevation. he data generated from the elevation readings must be referenced to mean sea level. Monitoring wells MW-1, MW-2, MW-3, MW-5, MW-7 MW-8, MW-10, MW-11, MW-22 shall be sampled quarterly. The analyses shall be performed at a laboratory certified by the Department of Health Services. All groundwater samples shall be analyzed for: Total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel BTEX Parameters measured in the field shall include temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, oxidatiodreduction potential and conductivity. All remaining wells and school water supply shall be sampled annually (Third Quarter of each year) as described for wells on the quarterly monitoring program. During quarterly monitoring, wells on annual monitoring program shall be measured for groundwater elevation and dissolved oxygen. REPORTING Reports shall include: groundwater elevation contour maps; direction of the groundwater gradient; locations of wells monitored; constituents and analytical results; chain of custody documents showing the: time and date of the sample collected, name of the person collecting the samples; signed laboratory sheets including quality control data and explanations of analytical anomalies, if any. These supporting documents may be included as appendices to the report; interpretations of the data; and a tabular summary of past analytical results.
