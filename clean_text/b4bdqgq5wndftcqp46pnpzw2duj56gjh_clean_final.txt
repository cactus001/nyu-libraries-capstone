Social Security www.socialsecurity.gov/policyfor December 2005State Statistics Program Data Social Security The Social Security program—Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)—provides monthly benefits to workers and their families when the worker retires, dies, or becomes disabled. The amount of the worker’s retirement insurance (old-age) or disability benefit is based on the worker’s level of earnings in employment or self-employment covered by the Social Security program. Monthly benefits are payable to retired workers at age 62 (with reduced benefits) or to disabled workers at any age. The benefit amount for an auxiliary or survivor beneficiary is based on a percent - age of the worker’s benefit. Auxiliary and survivor beneficiaries must generally meet an age, disability, or child care requirement. A total of 48,445,900 persons received benefits for December 2005.

Supplemental Security Income Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a federal cash assistance program that provides monthly payments to low-income aged, blind, and disabled persons in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The program is based on nationally uniform eligibility standards and payment levels. The federal SSI payment is determined by the recipient’s countable income, living arrangement, and marital status. As of January 2006, the maximum monthly fed - eral SSI payment for an individual living in his or her own household and with no other countable income is $603, and for a couple, $904. A state may supplement the payment levels of all or selected categories of recipients. These supplemen - tal payments may be administered by the state or the Social Security Administration.
