Title: Exclusion Determinations for New Non-road Spark-Ignited Engines, New Non-road Compression-Ignited Engines and New On-Road Heavy Duty Engines (Renewal). ICR numbers: EPA ICR No. 1852.04, OMB Control No. 2060–0395. ICR Status: This ICR is scheduled to expire on February 28, 2009. Under OMB regulations, the Agency may continue to conduct or sponsor the collection of information while this submission is pending at OMB. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information, unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control numbers for EPA’s regulations in title 40 of the CFR, after appearing in the Federal Register when approved, are listed in 40 CFR part 9, and are displayed either by publication in the Federal Register or by other appropriate means, such as on the related collection instrument or form, if applicable. The display of OMB control numbers in certain EPA regulations is consolidated in 40 CFR part 9. Abstract: Under the provisions of the Clean Air Act (Act), the Administrator is required to promulgate regulations to control air pollutant emissions from ‘‘motor vehicles’’ and ‘‘non-road engines,’’ as defined in the Act. Motor vehicles and non-road engines not meeting the applicable definitions are excluded from compliance with current regulations. A manufacturer may make an exclusion determination by itself; however, manufacturers and importers may routinely request EPA to make such determination to ensure that their determination does not differ from the Agency’s. To request an exclusion determination, manufacturers submit a letter with a description of the engine and/or vehicle (engine type, horsepower rating, intended usage etc.) and sales brochures to EPA. EPA uses this information to determine whether the engine or vehicle is excluded from compliance with one or more emission regulations. EPA then stores the data in its internal files, and makes it available to environmental groups and the public upon request under the Freedom of Information Act. Burden Statement: The annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 6 hours per response. Burden means the total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal agency. This includes the time needed to review instructions; VerDate Nov<24>2008 17:23 Feb 23, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\24FEN1.SGM 24FEN1mstockstill on PROD1PC66 with NOTICES
