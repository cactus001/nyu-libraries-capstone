2 TERRITORIAL SEA BOUNDARY: DENMARK-SWEDEN The Kingdom of Denmark and the Kingdom of Sweden signed a Declaration concerning the boundaries in the Sound (Sund or Oresund) on January 30, 1932. The Declaration came into force on the date of signing. Both countries are parties to the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf. The Declaration Between the Danish and Swedish Governments Concerning the Boundaries of the Sund set forth the following principles: The Royal Danish Government and the Royal Swedish Government, having carefully considered the question of boundaries in the Sound, (limited in the north by a line from Gibjerghoved to Kullen, and in the south by a line from the Stevns li ghthouse to Falsterbo Point), have found that the line hereinafter described affords a basis for the correct delimitation of the exercise by the two countries of the rights mentioned below: In the northern part of the Sound from its northern limit to the site of the Lous Flak light and soundbuoy (lat. N. 55º 49' 36"; long. E. 12º 42' 42"), the line runs midway between the coast of Zealand and the Swedish mainland (Ven Island being disregarded). From the site of the Lous Flak light - and sound - buoy, the line runs straight to the site of the Saltholm Flak lightbuoy N. E., (Lat. N. 55º 41' 55"; long. E. 12º 51' 00"), and thence in a southerly direction following straight lines drawn between the following four points: Lat. N. 55º 38' 37", long. E. 12º 5 3' 54" Lat. N. 55º 36' 49", long. E. 12º 53' 04" Lat. N. 55º 32' 25", long. E. 12º 43' 57" Lat. N. 55º 29' 19", long. E. 12º 43' 00" The line is continued to the southern limit in accordance with rules corresponding to those applicable to t he northern part of the Sound but is made up of straight lines determined by the following points: Lat. N. 55º 29' 19", long. E. 12º 43' 06" Lat. N. 55º 25' 52", long. E. 12º 36' 49" Lat. N. 55º 20' 12", long. E. 12º 38' 42" The geographical co-ordinates of the abovementioned points refer to the attached chart on which the line is marked.

3 The two Governments agree that the line in question shall form the boundary in the sound between the territorial waters of the two countries, as far as those territorial waters extend in accordance with the rules in force in this respect. The Danish and Swedish Governments undertake to refrain in the Sound, even outside territorial waters, from erecting lighthouses, seamarks, or fixed installations of any k ind whatever, to the east and west respectively of the said line, which shall also form the boundary for their right to mark and salve wrecks and to take any other measures for the safety of navigation and the like. Fixed seamarks or other installations which may have been previously erected by Denmark on the east or by Sweden on the west of the said line shall be removed by the State to which they belong, after negotiation between the competent Danish and Swedish authorities and within a period of six months from the date of signing the present Declaration. This Declaration involves no change in the existing rules regarding pilotage in the Sound (cf. Declaration of August 14, 1873, with the Annex of October 12, 1911), or in the regulations applicable to fishing in the navigable waterways adjacent to Denmark and Sweden (cf. Convention of July 14, 1899, and Declaration of October 5, 1907.) In faith whereof the undersigned, being duly authorized for the purpose have signed this Declaration, which is drawn u p in the Danish and Swedish languages, and have thereto affixed their seals. Done at Stockholm, in duplicate, January 30, 1932. ANALYSIS For the analysis of the territorial sea boundary (TSB) the following chart was utilized: U.S. Naval Oceanographic C hart H.O. 4868, 13th Edition, December 16, 1968. NOTE: There are cartographic errors on the map accompanying this study. 1) In the legend, the symbol for (a) terminal or turning point, and (b) the line identifier for the geographical limits of the Sound, have been reversed. 2) The registration of the plate for the overprinted red line has been inadvertently offset to the left. The TSB segment 1 -2-3-4 should not follow the boundary on the base chart (the black-dashed line), as the declaration language does not correspond completely with the base chart data concerning this portion of the TSB. This discrepancy between the declaration language and Chart H.O. 4868 could result from the different data used in compiling the base chart. On the other hand, the TSB segment from Saltholm Flak to Point 1 and the line from 4 to 5 to 6 should agree with the boundary on the base chart. The TSB extends for a distance of 63.3 nautical miles with the average distance between the nine boundary points of 7 nautical mil es. The average water depth at the terminal or turning points is 8 fathoms with minimum depths of 5 and 13 fathoms respectively.

4 The northern terminus of the TSB is the midpoint of the line delimiting the northern geographical limits of the Sound, i.e. the line connecting Kullen and Gilbjerg Hoved. From the northern terminus to Lous Flak, the TSB is an equidistance line 28 nautical miles long. This line ignores the presence of the Swedish offshore island of Ven and the boundary is equidistant from the mainlands and the latter is not. The Declaration states that the second point of the TSB is the Lous Flak light buoy and it is equidistant from the two mainlands. However, the location of Lous Flak (per the Declaration) and the location on the base chart d o not agree; the former is equidistant from the mainlands and the latter is not. This disparity is likely due to the discrepancy in datum planes of the base chart and the Declaration chart. The TSB from Lous Flak to Saltholm Flak is not equidistant betwe en the Danish and Swedish mainlands. The distance between the two points is 9 nautical miles. From Saltholm Flak to Point 1 of the TSB is a distance of 3.75 nautical miles. Point 1 is equidistant between Svaneklapper, Denmark and Limhamn, Sweden. Howev er the fact that Point 1 is equidistant probably had little bearing on the boundary delimitation. The distance from Point 1 to Point 2 is 1.9 nautical miles. This segment of the TSB does not correspond precisely with the boundary on the base chart H.O. 4 668: again the problems of different datum planes. The TSB according to the Declaration lies up to 1/8 nautical mile to the east of the boundary shown on the base chart. The TSB from Point 2 to 3 also does not correspond with the boundary on the base ch art. The line 2-3 lies to the southeast of the base chart boundary about 1/8 nautical mile. The distance between the two points is 6.75 nautical miles. From Point 3 to 4 is a distance of 3.15 nautical miles. The TSB closely approximates the boundary on the base chart, but lies slightly to the east of it. The TSB segment 4 -5-6 corresponds precisely with the boundary on the base chart. Points 5 and 6 are located equidistant from the respective mainlands. The distances between the points are 5 nautical miles from 4 to 5, and 5.75 nautical miles from 5 to 6. The southern terminus of the TSB is Point 6, which according to the terms of the Declaration is the midpoint of the line delimiting the southern geographical limits of the Sound. The midpoint on the base chart between Stevns Lighthouse and Falsterbo Point is not Point 6: again the datum discrepancies between the base chart and the Declaration chart.

SUMMARY The northern and southern limits of the TSB are based on the equidistance principle, that is, the segment from the northern terminus to Lous Flak, and the portion joining 4 -5-6. Points 5 and 6 are equidistant points. The remainder of the TSB was established through negotiation apparently with little concern with the coastal configuration. The TSB from the northern terminus to Lous Flak is an example where the presence of an offshore island (Ven) was ignored and the equidistant line was delimited between the respective mainlands.
