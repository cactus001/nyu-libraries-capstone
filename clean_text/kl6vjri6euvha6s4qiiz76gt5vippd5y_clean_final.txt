74 BUSINESSinUTAH 2009 74 BUSINNENESS in UTAH 2H 20090099A DRIVE THROUGH the Uintah Ba- sin, under the watch of King’s Peak, across the maize-colored, antelope speckled plains, through the alfalfa ﬁ elds and the red cliffs to the ﬁ sh-ﬁ lled waters of Flaming Gorge, to the lights of the oil rigs twinkling on the horizon, reveals that the lifestyle and economy of the Uintah Basin is grounded in natural resources. It’s a region of roots, veins and bones, of range cattle, oil wells and dinosaurs. Duchesne, Daggett and Uintah counties each bring unique boun-ties and challenges and most impor-tantly, opportunities for business. BREAKING THE BOOM AND BUST Gary McClellan is a saddle maker from Maeser, a small town just outside Vernal. For 18 years he has worked for Dry Fork Saddle, a company his brother, Brad, started in 1972. The company builds about 900 saddles a year and sell them worldwide for some $2,735 each. “We can’t keep up,” he says, but enjoys the work as much as the suc-cess. “I like seeing the ﬁ nished prod- uct. It is satisfying to watch progress every day, to see the end result.” They are so popular Discovery Channel is doing a “How it’s Made” special on the company. McClellan can sum up life in Uin-tah County as well as any economic developer or county ofﬁ cial. “I have a three-minute commute to work, the people are friendly, I don’t lock my doors at night, and you’re 30 to 40 minutes away from anything you want to do, horseback riding, whitewater rafting, the Green River, ﬁ shing…I enjoy the recreation.” Mark Raymond, County Commis-sioner says the area is growing fast. “Things are happening here,” he says. “The traditional boom-and-bust cycle of the Uintah Basin is past history.” He is talking about oil, of course, the grease of the county’s economic cogs for decades. But that grease, combined with a tradition of tourism and agriculture, has opened opportunities in other industries. Especially exciting are develop-ments in higher education, on the Utah State University Uintah Basin Regional Campus. Recently, Utah entrepreneur Marc Bingham and his wife, Debbie, donated $15 million to the campus to build the Entre-preneurship and Energy Research COUNTIES: Daggett, Duchesne, Uintah MAJOR CITIES: Vernal (8,403) Duchesne (1,553)Roosevelt (4,852)Manila (298) REGIONAL CIVILIAN LABOR FORCE: 25,472 AVERAGE WAGE: $30,031 (Daggett) $39,606 (Duchesne)$42,381 (Uintah) MAJOR EMPLOYERS: Duchesne County School DistrictUintah Basin Medical CenterHalliburton Energy ServicesColletts Recreation ServicesCash Meat MarketAnadarko Petroleum Corp.Ashley Valley Medical CenterJacob Fields Service N.A.National Forest ServiceUINTAH BASIN THIS LAND IS OUR LANDFAST FACTS FLAMING GORGECenter. Slated to open in 2009, the building will be a state-of-the-art, high-tech educational facility to train students in engineering, water man-agement, natural resources and en-vironmental policy, to name a few. In July, the Anadarko Foundation, a nonproﬁ t organization of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, announced a $1.5 million joint gift to the univer-sity and the Uintah Basin Applied T echnology College. The gift will fund construction of the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Industrial T echnology Building, which will offer programs critical to the natural gas and oil industry, but it will also edu-cate locals so that they are able to live and work where they grew up. “We will have state-of-the-art facili-ties, equipment and programs in in-dustrial engineering, chemistry and geology,” Raymond says. “We can get our young people to ﬁ ll the jobs we need.” Which leads to another so-called problem: more jobs than workers and a lack of housing for the work-ers already in place. “We have too many high paying jobs that we can’t ﬁ ll,” says Michael McKee, chairman of the Uintah County Commission. “Now that is an exciting problem!” According to the Utah Department of By Pamela Ostermiller DINOSAUR NATIONAL MONUMENT

Services related to mining, such as welding, trucking and commercial construction, are feeding off of oil and gas, yet there is growth in other areas as well, such as tourism. Ho tels are booked all sum- mer as are the area’s seven resorts, ranches and ﬁ shing destinations. In Myton, chic restaurant Hollow Moon is serving up fresh baby greens and gelato to locals and travelers alike. While “oil and gas may be our bread and butter, agriculture is our backbone,” Hansen says. Duchesne County ranks in the top ﬁ ve producers of cattle, hay and corn. Hansen, part economic developer, part cheerleader, part fundraiser, is especially excited to see county residents getting their piece of the pie. “When outside companies come into the county, that’s wonderful,” she says. “But when a local sees an opportunity and seizes it and ex-pands, that is even better!” County residents are better able to capitalize when they have local leaders rooting for them. For example, Duch-esne is the second largest user of the Enterprise Zone T ax Credit Program, created in 1988 for job creation and new investment in counties with less than 50,000 residents. Businesses that qualify receive helpful tax credits and in Duchesne, “it has helped a lot,” says Hansen. “It has been extremely well utilized.” A new program from the Gover-nor’s Ofﬁ ce of Economic Develop-ment has given one company in Bal-lard a huge boost. McMullin Heating & Cooling was recently awarded $50,000 from the Rural Fast Track (RFT) program, which provides incen-tives to help companies in small towns grow and offer additional high-er paying jobs. Amber McMullin, sec-retary for the company, says they will use the money for a new building for inventory and ofﬁ ce space, and hire more employees. In the past, “we have had to turn business away,” she says, but not anymore. McMullin is a company that has grown with the oil billion barrels of recoverable oil. The PEIS identiﬁ es the most promising shale areas in Utah, Colorado and Wyoming that will be open to appli-cations for commercial leasing. BLM Director Jim Caswell said in a press release, “The goal of the BLM’s oil shale program is to promote eco-nomically viable and environmen-tally sound production of oil shale on Western lands, where we estimate deposits hold…enough to meet U.S. demand for imported oil at current levels for 110 years.” For McKee, this is an unfathom-able opportunity for the people of Uin-tah County and beyond. “We could solve the nation’s energy needs. Utah is going to play a major role.” DUCHESNE: DIG IN Flanked by the Ashley National Forest and covered with a patchwork of farmland, Duchesne County is quiet and rural, but underneath the verdant hills hums an economic engine. The combination of bountiful natural resources and an energetic leadership that uses every tool in the box have kept the county on a growth pattern for years and most sectors show no sign of a slow down. All signs point to encourage growth and development. The strongest sector continues to be the oil and gas industry. Duch-esne is Utah’s largest producer of crude oil at 39 percent of the State’s output. “The durable nature of the industry encourages supportive new businesses which are starting up at breakneck speed,” says Irene Hans-“The goal of the BLM’s oil shale program is to promote economically viable and environmen-tally sound production of oil shale on Western lands, where we estimate deposits hold…enough to meet U.S. demand for imported oil at current levels for 110 years.” Jim Caswell DIRECTOR, BLM Workforce Services, unemployment is 2.6 percent. “We are very upbeat. We have a great county,” says Mc-Kee. “But we have shortages.” Some solutions are in motion. In July, the county approved an 80-acre development complex in Vernal for re-tail, entertainment and hotels, accord-ing to the Uintah Basin Standard. At least three hotels are planned, includ-ing Hawthorne Suites, La Quinta and Hyatt’s Summerﬁ eld Suites and, ac-cording to a developer quoted in the Standard, “Industry representatives from Halliburton and Anadarko have agreed to guarantee 60 percent occu-pancy of any hotel built on the site for the next three years.” While Uintah County is support-ing an ever-diversifying economy, McKee says the oil and gas sec-tors remain the strongest and most likely to grow. “They are driving our economy. Of the natural gas pro-duced in Utah, 57 percent comes out of Uintah County,” at a value of $1,160,209,692. McKee underscores the importance of the basin’s natu-ral resources. “Only 15 percent of the county is privately held, which means we have low property taxes. Seventeen percent is tribal. Our pub-lic lands are extremely important for recreation, agriculture and oil.” Big news came to the Basin in 2008, when the Bureau of Land Management released its Final Pro-grammatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for the Green River Formation, the largest oil shale de-posit in the world estimated at 800 UINTAH BASIN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ENERGY RESEARCH CENTER

But the company would not have qualiﬁ ed for the RFT award if it wasn’t for help from local ofﬁ cials. “We really appreciate Irene,” says McMullin. “She is on the ball. She made me realize that the RFT is for rural businesses and will help the community.”are second homes, enjoyed for one week, two weeks, or months at a time by Daggett part-timers. “Recreation is why a lot of people are here,” he says, “including full-time locals.” Because the majority of Dag-gett’s land is owned by the govern-ment, most residents work for the government in some capacity−in the ﬁ eld, the school district or local gov-ernment positions−or work in tourism and travel. This predicament, or opportunity, means that leaders must get creative and use the county’s natural beauty every way they can. While Daggett showed huge job growth in early 2008, it was due to pipeline construction and some expansion in the travel and tourism industry. The latter is the key to the region’s sustainable economy. According to the Economic De-velopment Corporation of Utah, Dag-gett County is working to update the County General Plan including the Dutch John area. The Report says that the County “is working with Aspen Rivers, LLC, a team of specialized planners, to evaluate existing plans and improve the implementation ability and create a clearer path to develop a sustainable economy.” Dutch John is just one region of many that offers potential growth for tourism. Over the years, economic devel-opers have created festivals, events and races—anything to attract new visitors to its outdoor playground. In August the county held the fourth T ower Rock 10K Run, an event cre-ated to generate revenue which has been a big success; this year there were 71 runners and 200 attendants to the post-run pasta bash. The First Annual Fall Festival at the Daggett County Park in Manila, featuring entertainment, a dinner, horseshoes and a beneﬁ t auction has kicked off a new tradition for the county. If the community is lacking in any-thing, says Hansen, it is more hotels and retail and, as in Uintah County, housing. “There is opportunity here. We are losing 75 percent of our retail money to other towns. Wal-Mart serves a region, but if they are not in your com-munity, you lose.” Hansen adds that the downtown is full, creating a need for infrastructure. “When you have fast growth, you have to adapt. But we are meeting the challenge.” DESTINATION: DAGGETT Tucked in Utah’s eastern-most cor-ner with endless opportunities for recreation, less than 1,000 residents and yet not one stoplight, Daggett County is the place to get away. “In the wintertime we are in our own little world,” says Brian Raymond, County Commission Assistant and Director of Economic Development. Of the 1,186 residences in the area, Raymond estimates that 70 percent NINE MILE PANEL
