May 9, 2007 Murtha: Elrama Sewerage Project Receives $1 million Grant For Immediate Release May 9, 2007 Murtha: Elrama Sewerage Project Receives $1 million Grant Washington D.C. - Congressman John P. Murtha, Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, announced today that the Elrama Sewerage Project, Washington County, has received a $1 million grant through the Army Corps of Engineers to expand sewer service to 240 dwellings in Union Township. The Elrama project will eliminate raw sewage that is being discharged into the Monongahela River and will eliminate pollution around the Pennsylvania American Water Company treatment facility, which furnishes potable water to several residents in the southern section of the City of Pittsburgh. "The Elrama Sewerage Project is a priority of Washington County, and I am pleased that with this funding the project will move forward to construction phase," said Murtha. "This project will eliminate the current malfunctioning on-lot systems, resulting in a healthier community and an economic tool for the residents and businesses of Washington County." The project consists of the construction of approximately 27,000 linear feet of sanitary sewers, manholes and appurtenances; a pumping station and a force main. Treatment will be provided at the existing sewerage treatment plant of the West Elizabeth Sanitary Authority. The funding received through Congressman Murtha will help to reduce the monthly user charge to local residents. The total cost of the project is expected to be over $5,100,000.
