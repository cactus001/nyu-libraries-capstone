See Furfuryl Alcohol from Thailand; Final Results of the Second Sunset Review of the Antidumping Duty Order and Revocation of the Order , 72 FR 9729 (March 5, 2007).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Background On July 26, 2007, the Department of Commerce ( ‘‘the Department ’’) published a preliminary notice of intent to rescind the antidumping duty new shipper review of certain frozen warm water shrimp from the People ’s Republic of China ( ‘‘PRC’’) with respect to Maoming Changxing Foods Co., Ltd. (‘‘Maoming Changxing ’’), covering the period February 1, 2006, through July 31, 2007. See Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from the People ’s Republic of China: Preliminary Notice of Intent to Rescind Antidumping Duty New Shipper Review , 72 FR 41058 (July 26, 2007). Extension of Time Limit of Final Results The final results for this new shipper review are currently due on October 17, 2007. Consistent with section 751(a)(2)(B)(iv) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended ( ‘‘Act’’) and 19 CFR 214(i)(2), the Department is extending the time limit for the completion of the final results of this new shipper review by 60 days because the case is extraordinarily complicated. This new shipper review involves complicated ownership and affiliation issues which will require the Department to consider arguments by interested parties regarding the actual owners and the source of founding capital with respect to Maoming Changxing. In addition, the Department requires additional time to consider domestic producers ’ arguments regarding the antidumping duty rate to apply to Maoming Changxing. Because of the complexity of issues in this case, and in accordance with section 751(a)(2)(B)(iv) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.214(i)(2), we are extending the time period for issuing the final results of the new shipper review of Maoming Changxing by 60 days. Since a 60-day extension would result in the deadline for the final results falling on December 16, 2007, which is Sunday, the new deadline for the final results will be the next business day, December 17, 2007. See Notice of Clarification: Application of ‘‘Next Business Day ’’ Rule for Administrative Determination Deadlines Pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930, As Amended , 70 FR 24533 (May 10, 2005). This notice is published pursuant to sections 751(a)(2)(B)(iv) and 777(i)(1) of the Act and section 351.214(i)(2) of the Department ’s regulations. Dated: October 4, 2007. Stephen J.

SUMMARY : On August 2, 2007, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on furfuryl alcohol from Thailand. The period of review is July 1, 2005, through May 3, 2006. The final results do not differ from the preliminary results of this review, in which we found that sales of the subject merchandise have not been made below normal value. EFFECTIVE DATE : October 12, 2007. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Damian Felton or Brandon Farlander, AD/CVD Operations, Office 1, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482 –0133 and (202) 482–0182, respectively. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Background On July 25, 1995, the Department published an antidumping duty order on furfuryl alcohol from Thailand. See Furfuryl Alcohol from Thailand: Notice of Amended Final Antidumping Duty Determination and Order , 60 FR 38035 (July 25, 1995). On August 30, 2006, the Department published a notice of initiation for this administrative review. See Notice of Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews , 71 FR 51573 (August 30, 2006). On August 2, 2007, the Department published in the Federal Register its preliminary results of the administrative review of this order. See Furfuryl Alcohol from Thailand; Preliminary Results of 2005 –2006 Antidumping Duty Administrative Review , 72 FR 42390 (August 2, 2007) ( ‘‘Preliminary Results ’’). In the Preliminary Results , the Department invited interested parties to submit briefs and request a hearing. No briefs were received and the Department did not conduct a hearing because none was requested. Scope of the Order The merchandise covered by this order is furfuryl alcohol (C4H3OCH2OH). Furfuryl alcohol is a primary alcohol, and is colorless or pale yellow in appearance. It is used in the manufacture of resins and as a wetting agent and solvent for coating resins, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, and other soluble dyes. The product subject to this order is classifiable under subheading 2932.13.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. Period of Review The period of review ( ‘‘POR’’) is July 1, 2005, through May 3, 2006. 1 Final Results of Review As noted above, the Department received no comments concerning the Preliminary Results. Consistent with the Preliminary Results, we find that a de minimis (i.e. , less than 0.50 percent) dumping margin exists for Indorama Chemicals (Thailand) Ltd. during the POR. Because no party submitted comments on the Preliminary Results and the Department has not made any changes to the Preliminary Results , we have not prepared a Decision Memorandum for these final results. For further details of our findings, see the Preliminary Results . Exporter/manufacturer Weighted–average margin percentage Indorama Chemicals (Thailand) Ltd. ........... 0.39* *This is a de minimis rate.

58057 Federal Register / Vol. 72, No. 197 / Friday, October 12, 2007 / Notices to issue assessment instructions to CBP 15 days after the publication date of these final results. Because the respondent did not report the entered value of its U.S. sales, pursuant to 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1), we have calculated importer –specific per –unit duty assessment rates by aggregating the total amount of antidumping duties calculated for the examined sales and dividing this amount by the total quantity of those sales. To determine whether the duty assessment rates are de minimis , in accordance with the requirement set forth in 19 CFR 351.106(c)(2), we calculated importer (or customer)-specific ad valorem ratios based on the estimated entered value. Where an importer (or customer)- specific ad valorem rate is zero or de minimis , we will instruct CBP to liquidate appropriate entries without regard to antidumping duties. The Department clarified its ‘‘automatic assessment ’’ regulation on May 6, 2003 (68 FR 23954). This clarification will apply to entries of subject merchandise during the period of review produced by reviewed companies for which these companies did not know their merchandise was destined for the United States. In such instances, we will instruct CBP to liquidate unreviewed entries at the all – others rate if there is no rate for the intermediate company(ies) involved in the transaction. For a full discussion of this clarification, see Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings: Assessment of Antidumping Duties , 68 FR 23954 (May 6, 2003). Cash Deposit Rates On March 5, 2007, pursuant to section 751(d)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended ( ‘‘the Act ’’), and 19 CFR 222(i)(1)(ii), the Department revoked the antidumping duty order on furfuryl alcohol from Thailand ( see Furfuryl Alcohol from Thailand; Final Results of the Second Sunset Review of the Antidumping Duty Order and Revocation of the Order , 72 FR 9729 (March 5, 2007)). The effective date of the revocation is May 4, 2006. As a result of this action, the Department does not intend to issue cash deposit instructions. Notification to Importers This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary ’s presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of doubled antidumping duties. Notification Regarding Administrative Protective Orders This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to Administrative Protective Order ( ‘‘APO ’’) of their responsibility concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 351.305. Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and terms of an APO is a violation which is subject to sanctions. We are issuing and publishing these results and this notice in accordance with sections 751(a)(1) and 777(i)(1) of the Act. Dated: October 14, 2007. David M. Spooner, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc.
