Rep. Blumenauer Statement on President Obama’s Afghanistan Speech Wednesday, 02 December 2009 04:41 Washington, D.C. – Congressman Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore) issued the following statement in response to President Obama’s remarks on the Administration strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan: I appreciate President Obama and his administration taking the necessary time to reevaluate America’s strategy in Afghanistan. It is imperative to think through the implications of sending more troops abroad, to engage our allies around the globe, and establish benchmarks as well as an exit strategy. Had this happened before the United States invaded Iraq, the world would be a different place today. I agree with everything President Obama has done to assess our role in Afghanistan, but I am unable to embrace his conclusion. It is unclear that 30,000 more troops will resolve the conflict, or at least allow us to leave in eighteen months. It may actually weaken our ability to deal with larger security and economic threats at home and abroad - from terrorist recruiting and nuclear weapons to unemployment and our budget deficit. The President argued that it will be more costly to muddle through in Afghanistan. Our experience to date in this troubled country and other flash points around the world does not suggest 30,000 more troops is going to make his other initiatives more effective. 1 / 1
