iii Decem ber 2 009 Director’s Message As the new year approaches, I’d like to reemphasize our commit­ ment to presenting our statistics in plain language and easy-to­ read formats as well as in more technical presentations. We’ve also tried to make it easier for our customers to access and down­ load our statistics inter actively. The SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS , both the tradit ional printed publication and the online version, has been a big part of our efforts. Over the past 12 months, we’ve made some improvements to the S URVEY . We’ve taken steps toward integrating our interactive data featur es with our traditio nal data pr esent ations. We’ve en­ hanced our online S URVEY search engine. We’ve made our articles more Web friendly. And we’ve continued to publish BEA Brief­ ings and Research Spotlights that explain important services and research in a less technical fashion. We look forward to the new year. There are many initiatives underway that will result in new prod ucts and servic es from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. As alwa ys, the SURVEY will be a prime tool in communicating these developments to our users. We apprec iate your comments and questions. J. Steven Landefeld Director, Bureau of Economic Analysis
