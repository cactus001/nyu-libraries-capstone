Form 6252 (2008) Page2 General Instructions Purpose of Form Generally, use Form 6252 to report income from casual sales during this tax year of real or personal property (other than inventory) if you will receive any payments in a tax year after the year of sale. For years after the year of an installment sale, see Which Parts To Complete below. Do not file Form 6252 to report sales during the tax year of stock or securities traded on an established securities market. Instead, treat all payments as received during this tax year. Do not file Form 6252 if you elect not to report the sale on the installment method. To elect out, report the full amount of the gain on a timely filed return (including extensions) on Form 4797 or the Schedule D for your tax return, whichever applies. If you filed your original return on time without making the election, you can make the election on an amended return filed no later than 6 months after the due date of your tax return, excluding extensions. Write “Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2” at the top of the amended return. Which Parts To Complete Year of Sale Complete lines 1 through 4, Part I, and Part II. If you sold property to a related party during the year, also complete Part III. Special Rules If any part of an installment payment you received is for interest or original issue discount, report that income on the appropriate form or schedule. Do not report interest received, carrying charges received, or unstated interest on Form See Pub. 537, Installment Sales, for details on unstated interest. A special rule applies to a first disposition (sale or exchange) of property under the installment method to a related party who then makes a second disposition (sale, exchange, gift, or cancellation of installment note) before making all payments on the first disposition. For this purpose, a related party includes your spouse, child, grandchild, parent, brother, sister, or a related corporation, S corporation, partnership, estate, or trust. See section 453(f)(1) for more details. Under this rule, treat part or all of the amount the related party realized (or the fair market value (FMV) if the disposed property is not sold or exchanged) from the second disposition as if you received it from the first disposition at the time of the second disposition. Figure the gain, if any, on lines 30 through 37. This rule does not apply if any of the conditions listed on line 29 are met. For certain dispositions under the installment method, if an installment obligation is pledged as security on a debt, the net proceeds of the secured debt are treated as payment on the installment obligation. However, the amount treated as payment cannot be more than the excess of the total installment contract price over any payments received under the contract before the secured debt was obtained. An installment obligation is pledged as security on a debt to the extent that payment of principal and interest on the debt is directly secured by an interest in the installment obligation. For sales after December 16, 1999, payment on a debt is treated as directly secured by an interest in an installment obligation to the extent an arrangement allows you to satisfy all or part of the debt with the installment obligation. The pledge rule applies to any installment sale after 1988 with a sales price of over $150,000 except: cPersonal use property disposed of by an individual, cTimeshares and residential lots. However, the pledge rule does not apply to pledges made after December 17, 1987, if the debt is incurred to refinance the principal amount of a debt that was outstanding on December 17, 1987, and was secured by nondealer real property installment obligations on that date and at all times after that date until the refinancing. This exception does not apply to the extent that the principal amount of the debt resulting from the refinancing exceeds the principal amount of the refinanced debt immediately before the refinancing. Also, the pledge rule does not affect refinancing due to the calling of a debt by the creditor if the debt is then refinanced by a person other than this creditor or someone related to the creditor. Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted. Do not file Form 6252 for sales that do not result in a gain, even if you will receive a payment in a tax year after the year of sale. Instead, report the entire sale on Form 4797, Sales of Business Property, or the Schedule D for your tax return, whichever applies. Later Years Complete lines 1 through 4 and Part II for any year in which you receive a payment from an installment sale. Interest Installment Sales to Related Party Sale of Depreciable Property to Related Person Pledge Rule If you sold property other than a marketable security to a related party after May 14, 1980, complete Form 6252 for the year of sale and for 2 years after the year of sale, even if you did not receive a payment. Complete lines 1 through 4. Complete Part II for any year during this 2-year period in which you receive a payment from the sale. Complete Part III for the 2 years after the year of sale unless you received the final payment during the tax year. If you sold a marketable security to a related party after May 14, 1980, and before January 1, 1987, complete Form 6252 for each year of the installment agreement, even if you did not receive a payment. Complete lines 1 through 4. Complete Part II for any year in which you receive a payment from the sale. Complete Part III unless you received the final payment during the tax year. Generally, if you sell depreciable property to a related person (as defined in section 453(g)(3)), you cannot report the sale using the installment method. For this purpose, depreciable property is any property that can be depreciated by a person or entity to whom you transfer it. However, you can use the installment method if you can show to the satisfaction of the IRS that avoidance of federal income taxes was not one of the principal purposes of the sale (for example, no significant tax deferral benefits will result from the sale). If the installment method does not apply, report the sale on Schedule D or Form 4797, whichever applies. Treat all payments you will receive as if they were received in the year of sale. Use FMV for any payment that is contingent as to amount. If the FMV cannot be readily determined, basis is recovered ratably. cFarm property, and After December 31, 1986, the installment method is not available for the sale of marketable securities. Generally, you must pay interest on the deferred tax related to any obligation that arises during a tax year from the disposition of property under the installment method if: cThe property had a sales price over $150,000, and Interest on Deferred Tax
