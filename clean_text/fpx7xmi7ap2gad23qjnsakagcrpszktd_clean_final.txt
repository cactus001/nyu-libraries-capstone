It’s Cool to Be Safe Printed on Recycled Paper Forest Service FY 2010 Guidance fo r Use of Incident Job Codes Attachment A – August, 2009 The following direction and procedur es will be used to establis h and charge to wildland fire, severity and support job codes in FY 2010: Incident job codes will have the region/unit override of the incide nt host unit. Incidents that qualify for a unique incident job code are as foll ows and will be established in the FireCode system:  Wildfire incidents 300 acres or more  Type 1 or Type 2 IMT is ordered  Type 3 organization is used P codes will be established only for direct suppression expenditure s through the FireCode system. Base salary will be charged to w ildland fire suppression (WFSU) for all employees assigned to fire incidents. Each land based unit will have one code for ABCD fires. These codes will be the same as in 2009, and will be reestablished by ASC for 2010. (see spreadsheet at http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/ibp/co st_accounting/cost_accounting.html ) All ABCD codes will be used with the region/unit override. The ABCD code format will be P#XXXX (where # is the region number and XXXX is created by the FireCode system). The ABCD codes will be used for the following:  Initial response to wildfires.  False alarms (including FS re sponse to DOI false alarms)  Extended response to wildfires under 300 acres (except as noted above) Each land based unit will have one code for fire support. These codes will be used for salary and other project support charges by dispatch cente rs, local caches, and unit employees providing general fire support that have tr aditionally been charged to ABCD Misc. Support codes will be used when an employee is working on multiple fires with different P codes and time cannot reasonably be separated out. If personnel ar e working on actual support to ongoing ABCD fires, they should charge to the ABCD code. Thes e codes will be the same as 2009 and will be reestablished by ASC for 2010. P-codes generated from the National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC) will use “W” as the second digit in the code. The following non-land based units will have a support code for all salary charges: The ASC, National Caches, GACCs, NICC, NIFC, ROs and the WO. When converting from WFPR work to WFSU fire support, salary charges will be ma de to this support code. Employees at these

Regional Foresters, Station Direct ors, Area Director, ITTF Director, Deputy Chiefs and WO Directors units will charge to a P or F code when they ar e specifically assigned to an incident or supporting only one incident and can identify time in mi nimum four hours blocks . WFSU fire support codes for non-land based units will change in 20 10 from a “WFSU” code to a pre-established code generated from Firecode with a WG pref ix (WG#### where # is th e generated Firecode). Each Region will have one P code for staging and/or transporting unassigned resources. The code of the requesting Region will be used on re source orders. Use of this code will be short term in nature and be limited to times when res ources are being ordered for active fire incidents, but the location of the resource as signment is not known. These code s will be pre-established and will use the region/unit override in the followi ng format: P#XXXX, where the XXXX is created by the FireCode system. Units are asked to limit the number of additional codes created in the FireCode system. While it is understood there are situations where the established codes are not adequate for specific needs, units should adequately describe the purpos e of the code in the FireCode name field. The following information is provided to update th e appropriate use of in cident and severity codes for the FY 2010 season. P-codes: Costs for responses for all size cla ss A, B, C, and D wildfi res for each forest will be collected under one P-code per Forest, except as noted below. Format is P#XXXX (where # is region and XXXX is created by the FireCode system), region/unit override will be used. Establ ished codes will be posted to the Forest Service Incident Business website: http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/ibp/co st_accounting/cost_accounting.html . Do not issue a unique P-code for wild fires under 300 acres unless you are certain it meets at least one of the following criteria:  Human caused  Trespass  Expected reimbursement  Cost share  Type 1, 2, or 3 Incident Management Team assigned Charge to the ABCD code until such time as you have determined one of the above criteria exists. All wild fires that are size class E , F, or G will be issued a unique P-code with the region/unit override. P-codes for DOI Fires: All Department of Interior (DOI) fi re codes will be issued by dispatch personnel or a DOI representative through the FireCode system. Fire codes will pass to the FS Financial system only if the fire code is flagged in the FireCode system with a value of “Y” for FS Assist . FS Assist should not be checked unless there is certainty that there will be Forest Service resources responding. These codes allow FS resources to charge to a FireC ode in support of DOI fires and will be assigned the appropriate lett er (D=BLM, A=BIA, P=NPS, R=FWS) after the P. An override of 1502 will be used for all DOI fires.

Regional Foresters, Station Direct ors, Area Director, ITTF Director, Deputy Chiefs and WO Directors H-codes: Use H-codes for approved BAER proj ects. One H-code will be established for each Region to track assessment expenditures for BAER teams. The H-codes will be established in the format: H#BAER (where # is the Region number). A Regional override will be used. These unique codes will enhance the abil ity of each Region to monitor annual assessment costs and simplify the process of establishing codes in time-critical situations. It also provides for the tran saction code (in accordance with Public Law 106-558) to be used for overtime rate equal to one and one-half times the hourly rate, which is appropriate for indi viduals involved in the preparation of a BAER plan. The overtime provisions appl y only until the initial BAER plan is submitted for approval. (See FSM 2523.) Each unit is responsible for cont acting the ASC Incident Finance at asc_ipc@fs.fed.us to request H-codes for BAER plan implementation, once the plan is approved. The H-code should mirror the P-code, including the region/unit override. If the P-code was a non FS juri sdictional incident and reflected a region/unit override of 1502, the H-code w ill reflect the region/unit override of the requesting unit. AD Support: A WFSUAD code for AD (Casual) tr aining and Work Capac ity Test will be issued for each Region. These codes are to be used for allowable expenditures for suppression funds. A Regiona l override will be used . Exclusive Use Aviation Contracts: Each region will be assigned a code for Exclusive Use contract availability as designated in the FY 2010 Program Direction. These codes will be pre- established code generated from Firecode with a WA prefix (WA#### where # is the generated Firecode) w ith Region/Unit override. National aviation contracts wi ll also be assigned a unique code for availability payments. S-codes: Each Forest will have two S-codes for severity. One code for Washington Office approved severity and a second code for Regional Office approved severity. National severity codes will be esta blished in the format: S#9999 and the Regional codes in the format: S#1111. Region/Unit overrides will be used. Please note that OMB is cl osely monitoring FS use of se verity and funding levels are being controlled through the apportionment process. Regions should insure that severity funds have been approved prior to charging to severity job codes.

Regional Foresters, Station Direct ors, Area Director, ITTF Director, Deputy Chiefs and WO Directors S-codes for DOI Severity: Assistance to Department of the In terior severity authorizations will be tracked separately. S-codes will be established to be used by individuals assisting a DOI Bureau under a severity request. Use the following S-codes on all related timesheets and travel vouchers. Do not use the individual severity codes established by DOI in the FireCode system as they will not be compatible with our systems. Job Code Override Agency S70001 1502 Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) – Severity assistance. S70002 1502 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) – Severity assistance. S70003 1502 Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) – Severity assistance. S70004 1502 National Park Service (NPS) – Severity assistance. FS Support of Non-Federal Fires: States will not be utilizing the FireC ode system to establish codes for non-federal fires. When federal resources respond and provide support to non-federal fires, the FS or DOI will create a fire code. The agency that receives the request initially, and fills an order, is responsib le for generating the fire code. These codes will be established with PN as the first two characters and the remaining four characters/digits will be generated by the FireCode system. These codes will have an override of 1502. Non-Wildland Federal Fire Departments/ Agencies: Non-wildland Federal fire departme nts and agencies, including but not limited to DOD and Tennessee Valley Authority, will not be utilizing the FireCode system to establish codes for their federal fire s. When federal resources respond and provide support to Federal non-wildland fire departments or agencies, the FS or DOI will retrieve a fire code. The agency that receives the request initially, and fills an order, is responsible for generating the fire code. These codes will be established with PF as the first two characters and the remaining four characters/digits will be generated by the FireCode system. Use override 1502. F-codes for FEMA Activations: Non-Fire FEMA Incident : A unique F-code will be established for each Mission Assignment received from FEMA for E SF4 non-fire activation. ASC-IF will not pre-establish these codes in FFIS, however a protocol has been provided in the attached spreadsheet for use on non-fire FEMA responses. FEMA codes will use

Regional Foresters, Station Direct ors, Area Director, ITTF Director, Deputy Chiefs and WO Directors the region/unit override in the following format: F#0000 where # is the Region in which the response is taking place. AS C-Incident Finance shall be notified by the Region or National Office, as soon as a j ob code has been assigned so that it can be established for use in FFIS. ASC-IF must also be provided a copy of the Mission Assignment (MA). Fire ESF4 Incident: Utilize FireCode for ESF4 wild land fire activations. ESF4 Fire Mission Assignments are the only MAs where multiple job codes can be assigned. The majority of FEMA ESF4 fires will start out with a PN**** or P#**** Firecode. When the fire is assigned to ESF4, the P code will change to a F#**** where # is the Region number, and **** is the same Firecode as the P code. For example PNLMNO would change to F#LMNO. In situations where the fire did not start out as a state PN code, assign a Fireco de with a prefix of F#. This will provide consistency with the current job code process for wildfire and will maintain the integrity of the fire costs for the specific fire. Each fire covered by the MA will have a unique F code. AS C-IF will be notified, as soon as a job code has been assigned or converted from a P# so that it can be established for use in FFIS. ASC-IF must also be provided a copy of the Mission Assignment. Base salary of all employees on assignment to a declared emergency will be paid from the Emergency Operations (WFSU) account. Non-Fire Emergency Job Codes: Upon execution of an interagency reimbursable agreement the Unit should request a unique reimbursable job code with the appropriate reimbursable program and fund. Contact ASC-Incident Finance to create the code prio r to incurring any expenses. Do not create a fire code in the FireCode system for non fire emergencies. Fire codes are processed into FFIS as they are created in the FireCode system. The job code cycles in FFIS do not run on Friday and Saturday night. Therefore, incident job codes passed to FFIS on Friday and Saturday nights will not be av ailable for use (in Paycheck and other systems) until after processing on Sunday night.
