Fireworks Safety Since 1994, fireworks-related injuries have decreased by about one-third. In 1998, the estimated number of people treated in U.S. hospital emergency roomsfor these injuries was 8,500, according to a recent study by staff at the U.S.Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). 1This is in contrast to an estimated 12,500 fireworks-related injuries in 1994. Special Study Each year, in addition to its year-round injury data collection, CPSC staff con-ducts a special study of fireworks injuries that occur around the Fourth of Julyholiday. About 60% to 75% of fireworks-related injuries occur during this period. The special fireworks study focuses more closely on the kinds of injuries associated with fireworks and the types of fireworks involved. For the 1998 study, CPSC staff examined fireworks-related injuries treated in NEISS hospital emergency rooms between June 23 and July 23, 1998. 2Victims were asked to identify the fireworks type from illustrations shown to them at theemergency room. Injury Data According to the data collected in the special study, children suffered a signifi-cant number of fireworks-related injuries. In 1998, about 40% of the fireworks-related injuries in the special study occurred to children under age 15. This issimilar to the data in CPSC’s 1997 special study, where children sustained about38% of these injuries. In 1998, according to the special study, those 15 to 24 years old incurred about 35% of fireworks-related injuries. The year before, this age group sufferedabout 26% of these injuries. Males incurred a significantly higher percentage of fireworks-related injuries than females. In 1998, males suffered about 75% of the injuries. This was thesame as reported in 1997. According to the 1998 special study, the highest percentage of fireworks-relat- ed injuries occurred to people’s hands, followed by eye injuries and head andface injuries. In 1998, hand injuries accounted for 35% of the total fireworks-re-lated injuries; eye injuries for 20%; and head and face injuries for 20%. In 1997,hand injuries comprised 35% of the fireworks-related injuries; head injuries for22%; and eye injuries for 18%. Over half of the injuries in 1998 involved burns. Eye injuries, however, typi- cally involved contusions or lacerations. This is similar to the pattern of injuriesin 1997.

2The type of firework involved in injuries in 1998 also was similar to 1997. Firecrackers were the leading causeof injury, followed by rockets and sparklers. About 15%of the injuries were related to illegal fireworks. Fireworks Regulations CPSC enforces a number of fireworks regulations.These include fuse burn time limits, a 50-milligram pow-der limit on firecrackers, requirements to preventtipover and blowout of devices, and requirements forspecific cautionary labeling. Other regulations affectcertain reloadable tube aerial shell fireworks and stabili-ty requirements for multiple tube devices. Millennium Celebration To highlight the importance of fireworks safety, CPSChas spearheaded a national public awareness campaignto promote fireworks safety during the millennium cele-brations and is an official partner of the White HouseMillennium Council. CPSC is working cooperativelywith a broad range of national, state, and local organiza-tions to disseminate information about fireworks safety.(See Millennium Fireworks Tips. ) The campaign will run from July 4, 1999 through New Year’s Day 2001. — Michael A.

That’s why CPSC and its nationaland state partners strongly recommend that youleave fireworks to the professionals. But if fireworks are legal where you live and you de- cide to set them off on your own, be sure to followthese important safety tips: nNever allow children to play with or ignite fire- works. nRead and follow all warnings and instructions. nBe sure other people are out of range before lighting fireworks. nOnly light fireworks on a smooth, flat surface away from the house, dry leaves, and flammablematerials. nNever try to relight fireworks that have not fully functioned. nKeep a bucket of water handy in case of a mal- function or fire.

Consumer Product Safety Review Spring 1999 3CPSC staff recently conducted a national study that identified potential safety hazards at child care settingsacross the country. The staff found at least one of thetargeted safety hazards at two-thirds of the 220 licensedchild care settings visited. 1 CPSC staff looked at eight product areas with poten- tial safety hazards. These included: cribs, soft bedding,playground surfacing, playground surfacing mainte-nance, child safety gates, window blind cords, draw-strings in children’s clothing, and recalled children’sproducts. These potential hazard areas were chosen because they are a source of injury to children in and aroundtheir homes and could be equally hazardous in childcare settings. Some of the targeted hazards were more obvious ones, like problems with used cribs or playground sur-facing. For example, more babies (about 40 to 50 eachyear) die in incidents involving cribs than any otherpiece of nursery equipment. Since 1990, at least ninechildren have died in crib-related incidents in child caresettings. 2 For young children, playground-related injuries ac- count for more visits to U.S. hospital emergency roomsthan any other child care-related injury. For example, in1997, about 60,000 children under 5 were treated inhospital emergency rooms for all playground-related in-juries. About 8,000 of these injuries occurred in childcare/school settings. 3Other potential hazards, like soft bedding or window blind cords, were selected because caregivers might notbe aware of potential dangers. CPSC recently issued newguidelines on soft bedding in cribs, urging that all softbedding be removed from cribs when babies are putdown to sleep. (See Soft Bedding, page 5.) About one child a month strangles in window cover- ing cords. These deaths have occurred both at homeand in child care settings. Background Data CPSC has reports of at least 56 children who have diedin child care settings since 1990. At least 28 of these chil-dren died from suffocation and/or asphyxia related tonursery equipment or soft bedding. About 31,000 children, 4 years old and younger, were treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms for injuries atchild care/school settings in 1997. The playground-re-lated injuries (8,000 in 1997) were the largest singlecause. There are 21 million children under age 6 in this country; almost 13 million of them are placed in non-parental child care during some portion of the day.About 29% of these children are in center-based care,including child care centers, Head Start programs, andnursery schools. The other 71% of these children are innon-center-based care, including family child care, in-home care, and care by a relative. ECOSA Conference For the first time, CPSC will co-sponsor theInternational Conference on Product Safety Researchwith the European Consumer Safety Association(ECOSA). This seventh annual international conferencewill be held on September 30 and October 1, 1999 nearWashington, DC in Bethesda, MD. The 1999 conference will focus on such topics as new consumer product safety issues; benefits of protectivesafety equipment; fire hazards and effective interventionstrategies; children’s hazards; and costs and benefits ofproduct safety improvements. The conference is especially designed for those from consumer safety agencies and injury control organiza-tions, consumer groups, national and international stan-dardization bodies, testing laboratories, consumer prod- uct manufacturers and designers, the research commu-nity, and trade associations. Last year, the ECOSA-sponsored conference was held in Amsterdam. ECOSA is a non-profit organization con-cerned with the safe design of consumer products.

Consumer Product Safety Review Spring 1999 4There are about 99,000 licensed child care centers in the U.S. In addition, there are about 283,000 regulatedor licensed family child care providers. In CPSC’s staffreview of state licensing requirements for child care,however, most of the hazards included in this child carestudy were not addressed. For example, although cribs are covered by both fed- eral regulations and voluntary safety standards, manystates did not require child care centers to use cribs thatmet all of these standards. Although virtually all childcare settings use nursery equipment, like high chairsand strollers, none of the states reviewed had require-ments for addressing recalled nursery equipment. Description of Study To conduct the study, CPSC staff visited four differenttypes of child care settings. These included: 23Government Services Administration (GSA)-managedchild care centers (sponsored by Cabinet-level and inde-pendent federal government agencies); 77 non-profitcenters; 68 in-home settings; and 52 for-profit centers. These child care settings were spread across the country. These included 73 child care settings in theeast, 76 in the west, and 71 in the central part of thecountry. Within each region, about 10% of the childcare settings were GSA-sponsored; 40% were non-profit;30% were in-home; and 20% were for-profit. Where possible, participating child care settings were selected randomly from regional or national lists of li-censed child care providers. When such lists were notavailable, selections were made from a variety of othersources, including Internet sites and local yellow pages. CPSC staff used a prepared checklist to observe con- ditions related to the eight product areas. Informationfrom the checklists was entered into a database for fur-ther analysis.Results of the Study Many child care settings provide safe environments foryoung children. Yet CPSC staff found the following re-sults at the child care settings included in this study. n8% of the child care settings had cribs that did not meet current safety standards. n19% of the child care settings had cribs that contained soft bedding. n24% of the child care settings did not have safe play- ground surfacing. n27% of the child care settings did not keep the play- ground surfacing well-maintained. n13% of the child care settings did not use child safety gates where necessary. n26% of the child care settings had loops on the win- dow blind cords. n38% of the child care settings had children wearing clothing with drawstrings at the neck. n5% of the child care settings had products that had been recalled by CPSC. Preventing Injuries CPSC staff found that most (two-thirds) of the child caresettings in the study had at least one safety hazard,putting children in these settings at risk of possible in-jury or death. CPSC staff’s review of state licensing re-quirements indicated that most of the hazards includedin the study were not adequately addressed in these re-quirements. To help prevent deaths and injuries at child care set- tings, CPSC released a Child Care Safety Checklist for par- ents and child care providers. (See page 6.) This checklist is intended to help adults easily identi- fy potential safety hazards both at child care settings andat home. CPSC staff is sending the checklist to nationalchild care groups, state licensing authorities, and otherchild care providers and organizations. Many of thesegroups are reprinting and distributing the checklist. — Carol Cave, Directorate for Field Operations, and Debra Sweet, Directorate for Epidemiology and Health SciencesChild Care Safety: First Lady Speaks Out First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined CPSC Chairman Ann Brown to kick off a national cam-paign to alert parents and caregivers to safety haz-ards in child care settings. On April 12, 1999, at achild care center in downtown Washington, DC, theFirst Lady and Chairman Brown announced the re-sults of the CPSC staff’s study and the availability ofthe CPSC child care safety checklist.

Consumer Product Safety Review Spring 1999 5Soft Bedding Dr. N.J. Scheers, Project Manager of the Infant Suffocation Project, discusses the new recommenda-tions for soft bedding in cribs and the association ofsoft bedding with sudden infant death syndrome(SIDS). What’s new about how babies should be placed to sleep?We’re recommending that when you put a baby down to sleep, be sure all soft bedding — like comforters,quilts, pillows, sheepskins, and pillow-like toys — is re-moved from the crib. How is this new recommendation on soft bedding different from the old one? For years, we recommended that soft bedding not be placed underneath babies. That’s because babies, in-cluding those correctly placed to sleep on their backs,can roll over, and the bedding can become moldedaround the infant’s face, nose, and mouth. Based onfurther research, we’re now recommending, in addi-tion, that no comforters or heavy quilts be used tocover the baby. One critical recommendation that remains un- changed is that babies should be put down to sleepon their backs, on a firm, tight-fitting mattress, in acrib that meets all current safety standards. What research findings led to this new recommendation on soft bedding? Research found that babies are at increased risk for SIDS if they get their heads covered by soft beddingwhile sleeping. The research showed that this can oc-cur even when they’re sleeping on their backs orsides. How is soft bedding related to SIDS? Since the Back-to-Sleep campaign, deaths from SIDS have dropped dramatically, by over 2,000 a year.However, about 3,000 babies still die of SIDS eachyear, and past studies suggest that some may have suf-focated when placed to sleep on top of soft bedding.If comforters or quilts are not recommended to keep babies warm, what can be used? Consider putting the baby in a sleeper. If you must use a blanket, use a thinone. Place the baby withhis or her feet at the footof the crib. Then tuckthe blanket around thecrib mattress, extendingthe blanket only as far asthe baby’s chest. (Seepicture at left.) For what ages do these rec- ommendations apply? We recommend that all soft bedding be removedfrom cribs of childrenunder 12 months. Is it safe to put babies down to sleep in places other than cribs? We recommend that babies not be placed to sleep on soft surfaces like waterbeds, sofas, soft mattresses, andpillows. There’s always the possibility of suffocation ifthe soft surface molds around the baby’s face. Do pediatricians agree with these new recommendations on soft bedding? The American Academy of Pediatrics, along with the National Institute of Child Health and HumanDevelopment, joined CPSC in issuing a recent safetyalert that warned against placing babies to sleep in anenvironment with soft bedding.

6Consumer Product Safety Review Spring 1999 Here are some safety tips for parents and child care providers to use at child care settings. For a completeversion of the checklist (in English or Spanish), visitCPSC’s website at www.cpsc.gov or send a postcard to: Child Care Safety Checklist CPSCWashington, DC 20207 lCRIBS Make sure cribs meet current national safety stan-dards and are in good condition. Look for a certifica-tion safety seal. Older cribs may not meet currentstandards. Crib slats should be no more than 2 3/8”apart, and mattresses should fit snugly. lSOFT BEDDING Be sure that no pillows, soft bedding, or comfortersare used when you put babies to sleep. Babies shouldbe put to sleep on their backs in a crib with a firm,flat mattress. lPLAYGROUND SURFACING Look for safe surfacing on outdoor playgrounds — atleast 12 inches of wood chips, mulch, sand or peagravel, or mats made of safety-tested rubber or rub-ber-like materials.

11Consumer Product Safety Review Spring 1999 NHTSA Recalls The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is the gov- ernment agency responsible for improving safety on our Nation’s highways.As part of its efforts to achieve this goal, NHTSA is authorized to ordermanufacturers to recall and repair vehicles or items of motor vehicle equip-ment (including air bags, tires, and child safety seats). The following safety recall campaigns are being conducted in coopera- tion with NHTSA. For more information about NHTSA recall activities,you can access NHTSA on the Internet at http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov or bycalling the NHTSA Auto Safety Hotline at 1-888-DASH-2-DOT (1-888-327-4236). AmTran Corporation AmTran is recalling 8,217 1993-1999 Genesis, FE, 1996-1999 RE, 1997-1999 Conventional, and 1993-1997 Volunteer school buses equipped with flip seats at the emergency exits. The seat cushionhinge on the combination flip seat is located in such a manner thatit is within easy reach of the passenger sitting in the seat located be-hind the combo flip seat. The hinges on the combo flip seat canpinch or sever fingers, resulting in personal injury. [NHTSA RecallNo. 99V061/ AmTran Recall No. 99-303] Bayerische Motoren Werke BMW is recalling 32,500 1999 BMW 323i and 328i vehicles built with a side air bag system consisting of door-mounted thorax airbags (rear door air bags are optional), a Head Protection System(HPS) for front occupants, a central electronic sensor and diagnos-tic system, left and right satellite impact sensors, and associatedwiring, manufactured from June 1998 through March 1999. Thissystem is unduly sensitive to certain non-crash impacts, such as con-tacting large potholes or curbs at substantial speed. This couldcause the side air bag and HPS to deploy without an actual sidecrash. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a reason-able time should contact BMW at 1-800-831-1117. [NHTSA RecallNo. 99V063] DaimlerChrysler Chrysler is recalling 263,000 1995-1997 Dodge Ram van and wagon model vehicles manufactured from August 1994 through August1997. If water/road salt gets on the interior floor of the vehicle inthe proximity of the air bag electronic control module (AECM),the AECM can corrode. The resulting corrosion can cause the dri-ver side air bag to deploy inadvertently. Deployment of the air bagwithout warning could cause a driver to lose vehicle control, in-creasing the risk of a crash and personal injury. Owners who donot receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should con-tact Chrysler at 1-800-992-1997. [NHTSA Recall No.99V023/Chrysler Recall No. 815] Ford Motor Company Ford is recalling 757,000 1992-1997 Ford Aerostar Mini Vans man- ufactured from August 1991 through August 1997. These vehicleswere produced with a higher than specified electrical load throughthe accessory power feed circuit that connects to the A2 (accesso-ry) terminal within the ignition switch. As a result, during startup,electrical arcing of the A2 terminal to the terminal bridge couldpotentially cause pitting of the bridge. This condition, over time,could create a short circuit and allow current to flow through theground wiring, causing overheating and the potential for a vehiclefire. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a reason-able time should contact Ford at 1-800-392-3673. [NHTSA RecallNo. 99V029/Ford Recall No. 99S02] Ford will also recall 895,000 certain 1997-1999 RHD Explorer equipped with 4.0L OHV/SOHC engines and speed control builtfrom May 29, 1996 through March 4, 1999; 1998-1999 Explorer/Mountaineers equipped with 4.0L OHV/SOHC or 5.0L engines or 1998-1999 Rangers equipped with 2.5L, 3.0L FFV/EFI or 4.0L engines and speed control built from January 5, 1998through March 4, 1999; 1998-1999 Mustangs equipped with 3.8L, 6L 2-valve or 4-valve engines and speed control built from March2, 1998 through March 4, 1999; 1999 F250/F350/F450/F550 (over 8,500 lbs.) trucks equipped with 5.4L or 6.8L engines and speedcontrol built from March 2, 1998 through March 4, 1999; and1999 F-53 stripped chassis equipped with 5.4L or 6.8L engines and speed control built from March 2, 1998 through March 4, 1999.The speed control cable can interfere with the speed control servopulley and not allow the throttle to return to idle when disengag-ing the speed control. If the speed control is used and this condi-tion is present, a stuck throttle could result, increasing thepotential for a crash. Owners who do not receive the free remedywithin a reasonable time should contact Ford at 1-800-392-3673.[NHTSA Recall No. 99V062/Ford Recall No. 99S09] Harley-Davidson Motor Company Harley-Davidson is recalling 14,211 1999 FLHT, FLHTC, FL- HTCUI, FLHTCI, FLHTPI, FLTR, FLTRI, FLHR, FLHPI,FLHP, FLHRCI, FXDL, FXDWG, FXDS CONV, FXD, and FXDXmotorcycles manufactured from February 1998 through January1999. The engine cam bolt can lose its clamp load and/or break.This condition can cause the engine to quit running with or withoutprior warning. In some instances, the engine could run erraticallybefore quitting. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within areasonable time should contact Harley-Davidson at 1-414-342-4680.[NHTSA Recall No. 99V003/Harley-Davidson Recall No. 095] General Motors Corporation GM is recalling 2,090 1996-1998 Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari minivans equipped with integrated child seats and manufactured from May 1996 through September 1997. Some of these vehiclesmay be missing a seat belt retractor clutch spring and/or pawlspring in the child seat. If the clutch spring was missing, the seatbelt would lock in the retracted position and could not be used. Ifthe pawl spring was missing, the seat belt restraint would continu-ally play out and not lock. These conditions could increase the oc-cupant’s risk of injury in the event of a vehicle crash. Dealers willinspect the seat belts on the child seats, and if necessary, replacethe child seat. Owners who do not receive the free remedy withina reasonable time should contact Chevrolet at 1-800-222-1020 orGMC at 1-800-462-8782. [NHTSA Recall No. 99V009/GM RecallNo. 98071]GM is also recalling 988,587 1994 Chevrolet C10, C20, C30, C3500, Suburban, GMC C15, C25, C35, C3500, and Suburban ve-hicles manufactured from March 1993 through September 1994. These vehicles were built with the polarity of the wiring for thebrake switch reversed from what was specified on the switch draw-ing. With the reversed polarity, the contacts in the brake switchcan wear out prematurely. The brake switch will perform normal-ly until the brake switch contacts wear out, resulting in loss of thebrake lamps without any warning to the driver. This would fail towarn a following driver that the vehicle is braking and could leadto a crash. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within areasonable time should contact Chevrolet at 1-800-222-1020 orGMC at 1-800-462-8782. [NHTSA Recall No. 99V025/GM RecallNo. 98065]
