New York State Department of Labor Technology Projects Alchemy Calais Open Source Natural Language Processing A proof of concept (PoC) was completed using ope n-source natural language processing technology to parse resumes, job opening descriptions (OSOS databa se), and training opportunity descriptions (ETP database) and match, based on tagged metadata, an i ndividual’s resume with potential job and training opportunities. This PoC proved to be successful with approximat ely 70-80% accuracy on matching. We believe by cleaning the data we query against in our databases, and exploring alternative data repositories (using information from web sites like Monster.com for jo b listings and exploring additional training providers), we can get the accuracy percentage much higher. We ’d also like to increase the robustness of the application by adding mapping/geo-coding technology to allow for searching within a specified geographic area. (For example, available opportunities within 20 miles of a specified zip code). Current Status Report: 8/20/2010 Continued analysis of data sources to provide the most relevant search results for training and job opportunities began. Both Alchemy & Calais open-source natural language processing tools have been utilized at this po int. Currently, our data sources to run against these tools have been our own job listing and training pr ovider databases. Currently, we are exploring an external site to see if they offer a service that would allow us to sear ch a broader list of job listings. Geo- mapping technology is being explored to provide sear ch results for training or employment opportunities within a specific (e.g. 10, 25 or 50) mile radius from a specified zip code. Apprenticeship Training Program Database The Apprenticeship Training Program currently has 2 separate Microsoft Access databases and paper files to manage the Apprenticeship Training Programs and Apprentices. This project would create one all inclusive secure, web-based, user-friendly, transactional, tracking and monitoring database.

Project Impediments Impacting Progress and Actions to Mitigate: None to repor Asset Center Upgrade This project is proposed to enhance the Department of Labor’s Asset Management system in order to gain new functionality that will bette r meet users’ requirements an d to obtain previously included functionality that was lost in an earlier upgrade. There are additional reasons to enhance the Asset Management system: the inventory system has never ac hieved its promised efficiencies; redundant data entry wastes valuable Department of Labor resources; the current system does not allow for edits to a request once submitted; there is no standardized desc ription field, making it impossible to sort and track by item description; and the asset catalog nee ds to be updated and made more extensive. Current Status Report: 05/25/10 Responses were received from the Bid. They are being scored and will then be returned to Purchase for review. Building 12 Server Room Upgrade The New York State Department of Labor Technical Services group (NYSDOL TS) is working with the New York State Department of Labor Property Office (NYSDOL PO) to determine whether to keep the Building 12 server room in Basement Room #4 (BD-4) or move to Basement Room #6 (BD-6, Northwest corner of the building). Basement Room 15 was an option but was removed from consideration when NYSDOL PO informed the team that there is periodic water damage in the room. The goal is to refresh the physical plant resource s supporting the development computing environment. It is necessary to provide a more robust and secure si te that allows flexibility for fu ture growth. Once this is in place the project can be closed out. Thereafter work w ill be tracked in the Keep projects within Technical Services.

Current Status Report: 08/20/10 First phase of project is marked as complete. OGS has accepted the project and assigned the engineer. DOL property has re ceived first cut of estimate and is reviewing Change Management for IT Service Management (ITSM) This project was created to develop and implement a Change Management ITSM process which will ensure that standardized methods and procedures ar e used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes. Current Status Report: 06/24/2010 WE met with the Release Management Team to gather their requirements for Change Management workflow. The team will need to meet again once the project resource returns from vacation. Project is further delayed because we are unable to migrate to the needed version of Footprints. While Footprints can run on the server and operating syst em levels in the environment, it cannot be deployed using the current and probably unsupported SQLServe r 2000 environment. We cannot go forward with any Footprints deployments until the Database Ad ministration team can create a SQLServer 2008 environment for us. Workflows and their status: Workflow Status WSRR EPAS added additional requirements to their workflow, and additional data items. Project Request Received list of authoriz ed requestor list from BACS; configuring workflows. Advised that the workfl ow is changing for UI requests; sent current workflow to Eric Goldberg and Pat LaPlante for their requirements changes. Database Met with Database representa tives to document their workflow Deployments/Release Management Met with architects to discuss their requirements LDAP requests Part of new User maintenance project User Maintenance Skeleton built in user maintenance/IRR project for security reasons. VPN requests Need to create Visio diag ram for the various type of VPN requested Contact Center Implementation The New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) is a leader in providing integrated customer service to jobseekers, workers and employers in the highly competitive workforce of the 21st century. The Department fulfills its mission thro ugh a wide variety of activities that revolve arou nd the needs of employers and workers. The Department:  Administers the Unemployment Insurance Progra m, which provides temporary financial support for those who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own.  Provides employment-related informatio n and job search assistance services.  Provides training programs and retraining programs for workers displaced by technology change or foreign competition.  Enforces regulations designed to minimize hazards in the workplace.  Works with the private sector to create job opport unities for the labor force and to meet employer needs for qualified workers.  Enforces the State Labor Law to prevent the exploitation of workers, including minors and immigrant workers.  Protects the safety of the pub lic on ski tows, amusement rides and in places of public assembly.

--- Page 3 ---
 Regulates the handling of asbestos to protect both workers and the general public.  Provide accurate and timely data on present and future economic trends affecting the people of the state.  Works as a cooperating agency in the Federal/S tate labor market information statistical programs. Much of the information regarding the above services and regulations is not easily accessible to New Yorkers. To facilitate the prov ision of services and enforcement of regulations, the Department has initiated an effort to create a centralized customer Contact Center. The purpose of the new Contact Center is to communicate information regarding prog ram opportunities, instructions concerning NYSDOL regulations, and general statistical informati on with regard to Department programs. The communication channels that will be administered are:  Telephone  Email  Web Chat  Online Ticketing Current Status Report : 8/20/2010 Customer update meeting was co nducted by status report and scrum.  Staffing: The Training department continues to wo rk on their strategic approach for the training curriculum and for the learning env ironment approach. Approvals for staffing are still with Civil Service.  Facilities: The room availability is still estimated at the end of August.  Equipment: We know that we will need headphones but not telephones. We may need chairs, supplies, and other start up items. We will review the hardware. We know we will have to scrub the current computers and re-image them to the Contact Center requirements.  Telephony: The budget requests have been submitt ed and are awaiting processing. The work for setting up the call management process will commence following the analysis completion on 9/15.  Software: this remains the same from last week due to vacations with the business analyst.  Analysis: Interviews for the analysis continue. Target date for the completion of the analysis is September 15th. COOP Emergency Notification System The Continuity of Operations Plans (COOP) for the Department of Labor and its Divisions require an emergency notification system that will allow the D epartment to promptly contact affected employees during or outside of work hours in the event of an emergency which may impact on their job location. The COOPs also require rosters of employees on em ergency management teams with updated contact information. The Department currently does not have employee home contact information available electronically. The Department plans to ut ilize NY-Alert system for emergency notific ation to its employees. NY- Alert is operated by the NYS Emergency Management Office ( SEMO) at no cost to NYS agencies. Under NY- Alert, DOL personnel authorized by management will hav e the capability to send emergency messages to employees which will be sent immediately and simultaneo usly to employees at each mode of contact that employees have provided. An MOU between DOL and SEMO is in process. This project will set up a process internally to co llect the information and pr ocess any updates. This information can then be provided electronically to NY-Ale rt for integration into that system. The employee data will only be utilized for sending emergency mess ages by DOL management and NY-Alert when that system is operative.

--- Page 4 ---
Current Status Report: 8/26/10 We sent a follow-up email to the vendor to see when the data will be loaded from the spreadsheet that we sent. They ar e validating the data and will let us know when they plan to load it into the application. The order form for NY-Alert is being reviewed and we will follow up with Counsel's office for final sign o ff. Instructions are being written up for the staff who will be notifiers in NY-Alert. Two test groups have been set up in NY-Alert and emergency management staff are familiarizing themselves with the system. A st atus meeting was held wi th the customer. Customer Verification Service with Department of Motor Vehicles Currently the Department of Labor (DOL) has an Oracle database stored procedures solution to query the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) when claimant s apply for Unemployment Insurance benefits. The current solution was architected in 1997 when the DOL opened the Telephone Claim Centers. The solution is running on old technology (hardware and software) and we have experienced several infrastructure failures at the DMV data center ov er the last 6 months. These failures have caused disruption to the DOL UI Claims taking operations . DOL and DMV would like to refactor the current solution to a web-services solution that can be reused with multiple applications and customers who may need to consume/share this service. DOL specifically is interested in modernizing the solution to improve the performance and reliability of the technical inte rface to the DMV information thus improving the workflow and processing of UI Claims that require DMV information for customer identity verification. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 The MOU is in the mail. It needs to be sent to DMV and then back to DOL with the correct signatures. The staging envir onment is having a firewall issue. A request was made to OFT to open the port on the firewall. Data Sharing Assessment Project The purpose of this project is to develop an analysis report for data sharing with other New York State governmental entities, and to implement data sharing begi nning with the New York State Insurance Fund. The New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) is responsible for a variety of programs, including Worker Protection, Unemployment Insurance, Em ployment Services, and Workforce Development. Information from these programs is collected and ma intained by various divisions in the department. Many other governmental entities may find this informat ion useful in that it c ould serve to decrease costs and improve service by simplifying their operations a nd improving data quality. NYSDOL information may assist other governmental entities to verify the existence, location a nd status of employers, employees and other program participants. This information could be used to facilitate eligibility determination for various other New York State programs, licenses and permits. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 There has been little progress on MOU. DOL counsel office has sent query on use of Data. NYSIF have to respond back. Counse l office is still waiting to hear the use of data. Counsel's office suggested that the technical team should not start sharing the data unless the MOU is signed. Team is working on getting a MOU in place between NYSIF and DOL. Data Warehouse: Federal Reporting The Data Warehouse Federa l Reporting project will ensure that the Unemployment Insurance Federal reports, the Employment & Training Administration (ETA) Series, are produced from the Data Warehouse instead of being produced from multiple data sources. It will also ensu re that the reports are accurate since the report data items will be calcul ated using the single source of data. Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 This week, activities focused on Employment and Training Administration (ETA) Federal report ETA 5159. We have completed the coding of the work share report segment and have updated EUC report segment with t he new employer numbers. Next week we expect

--- Page 5 ---
to publish new report values for validation and to comp lete the business requirements for the work share report segment. Disaster Recovery There currently is no implemented Di saster Recovery (DR) plan or env ironment in place at New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL). A DR plan has been created in December of 2008 for the purposes of implementation but has not been exec uted. Audits have been performed that have found NYSDOL to be non-compliant with ensuring the appropria te back up of existing servers and applications. There are two paths being followed on this project in parallel: NYSDOL is working with the New York State Depa rtment of Labor Property Office (NYSDOL PO) to determine the cost and terms associated with placin g the DR site in the Glendale building #7 facility located outside of Binghamton, NY. One of the IBM Power6 595s purchased through the UNIX project will be used for the Development/Testing/DR environment in BD-4. It w ill initially be set up to prototype what the DR environment will look like. A decision will be made late r in the process to see if the configured P6 595 will be moved down to Glendale or if a new server will be purchased. The goal is to set up the DR facility with the appr opriate network, HVAC, Power, Data Circuits and Network Security Devices; as well as procure the hardware (Servers, Voice Cards, PBX) to ensure the continued operation of the UI Benefits Claims, SOA, and select Legacy systems. The project will be closed once these are in place. Thereafter work w ill be tracked in the Keep projects within Technical Services. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 A project Review was held for this project and it was decided that this project will be put on hold until Technical Services is able to hire someone who has done disaster recovery implementations. This resource will become the project manager. The PTP is at OFT. Work will not wait until OFT DR site is identified and available. It will resume upon hiring of the technical expert. Document and Correspondence Management For a very long time, DOL’s business has been very paper and image-based. As time progresses and we move towards communicating with our customer via multiple channels (web, email, snail mail/paper) the need to identify a solution for management of a complex document/correspondence environment becomes very important. Document and Correspondence Management is a project to identify all the different types of content that DOL uses today (many produced from disparate prod ucts/sources). Additionally, we need to categorize all content. These content categories would be woul d be: mass-printed letters (1-way communication to DOL customer); one-off letters (printed one at a time; 1-way communication); forms (applications for certain licenses or programs that we need to pres ent both electronically & in paper formats; 1-way communication from a customer to DOL); questionnaire s (questionnaires sent to employers & claimants during the adjudication process; 2-way communication between DOL and a customer). One way communication to a DOL customer (one-off or mass printed) should use our existing xPression solution, and the standards around how to do this must be adhered to. The overall Document/Correspondence Standards will be part of th is project. (although there are currently existing usage documentation for xPression, which should be used and will be incorporated into this standard when it is produced for this project) For 2-way communication between DOL & a customer (forms & questionnaires), the solution will be identified and implemented as part of this project.

Current Status Report: 08/13/10 The project team and the EPAS functional manager met on 8/9 to discuss project requirements and scope. The lead analyst produced a list of requirements pulled from a UISIM document. They were reviewed in an 8/12 meeting and the team chose the ones that were applicable to the project. EA Foundational Services In a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), small com puter programs called services are orchestrated into composite applications that provide many different functions to end users. These services can be categorized many ways and provide many different ty pes of capabilities. At Labor we often look at our services in four basic layers. The first layer is Foundational Services, which deals with things like workflow, error-message-handling, logging, routing, caching, and notifications. It is expected that New York State’s SOA based modernization effort will be gr eatly accelerated so it is now essential that the foundational services be completed based on industry and Labor specific standard s, best practices and patterns. Four foundational services in particular will be addr essed. Workflow, GUI Framework, Correspondence Management and Document Management will be the focus of this project, based on their criticality and the amount of work remaining to complete them. Tasks involved in this project would include:  Final design for each foundational service. The primary high level design documents have been completed. The first goal of the project team w ill be to complete deeper level design so that the development sprints may be initiated. This ma y require additional requirements gathering from the CAD teams that will be consuming these services  Develop each foundational service. Development w ill be carried out in an agile, iterative fashion. Sufficient design will have been conducted to devel op each service, and the CAD teams will have the opportunity to review deliverables regularly , and requirements and design will be adjusted as needed.  Testing of each foundational service. Testing at the end of each delivery cycle will ensure that the development teams are meeting the requirements of the Composite Application Development (CAD) teams. Testing will include unit testing, to demonstrate that each module produces the expected outputs. Integrat ed tests will make certain that each service behaves as expected when interacting with all pieces of a composite applic ation. Finally, performance testing will assess the service’s capacity to perform at acceptable leve ls under the duress of high levels of concurrent transactions.  Deployment. Once the testing of each foundatio nal service is complete, the service will be promoted to the Production environment. Current Status Report: 8/20/10 The Customer meeting was conducted this week. Workflow Deliverable - the Trust Association Interceptor (TAI) license has passed from Finance and has gone to the vendor. Final testing in the DEV environment should be completed next week. ECM for Worker's Comp This project will take existing documentation that is currently maintained in hard copy and store it electronically within the ECM reposito ry. Users will be given the means to import new data as it arrives. Users will use a web interface to ac cess stored data. Initial use will be limited to the personnel unit but moving forward access could be afforded to authorized users for access to predefined views; a claimant to view their case file, for instance. Additionally, this project will look to utilize the workflow capabilities of ECM in an attempt to streamline the Workers Compensation process. The implementation of this project will provide increas ed security of sensitive per sonnel documentation as data will now be password protected. Access will be lim ited to specific users with predefined rights. In

--- Page 7 ---
addition, there is an expectation of improvement in both accuracy and ex pediency as the risk for human error is greatly reduced. Electronic files are far le ss susceptible to loss, damage or misplacement then the current hard copy system. ECM can alert users when a document has lingered longer than what is considered acceptable thereby greatly reducing t he chances for accidental oversights. Finally, implementation will significantly limit the amount of paper required to accommodate the unit’s tasks. Effectively reducing paper, printer and toner costs as electronic versions of documentation are available for use and reuse. Current Status Report: 08/13/2010 (COTS Package Install and Configuration) Sprint Name: Sprint 1 - Design, Timeline Status : Behind Schedule (Ahead of Schedule, On Schedule, Behind Schedule, Blocked, On-Hold) Sprint 1 Overview: Define Item types and ACL's Deliverable Status: Status Summary: We have discovered that the looks ups we deem necessary to make the product useful to the user are not supported by the front end (webi) that has been provided. We have to gather more information at this point both from IBM and our own research to determine whether our assumptions of the front end are incorrect or if not do we need to expand the project and create our own front end - which would require additional resources. Sprint Accomplishments this Week: Discovered that wh ile we can connect to the necessary tables and the API's exist to retrieve this data the supplied front end does not seem capable to receive the data. Project Impediments Impacting Progress and Actions to Mitigate: None to Report Eligible Training Provider List Rewrite The New York State Eligible Training Provider List (NYS-ETPL) was established in compliance with Title 1, Section 122 of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998. The purpose of the ETPL is to re-write the existing application to present a broad and diverse se lection of training choices to support employment goals of individuals. The following revisions, upgrades and additions to the current ETPL website must be made:  The site needs to be given the ability to rapidly identify and categorize priority training offerings at the State, Regional and Local levels. The method for doing this should also identify the sector the training relates to and identify which are consider ed “Priority Sectors” at the State, Regional and Local levels.  The current search function does not produce complete/correct results and must be updated and corrected.  An upgrade in the ability to report on performance information is necessary.  Connectivity between the site and the One Stop Operating System (OSOS) needs to be established.  A crosswalk created between the Classification of Instructional Program (CIP) codes with SOC codes should be created.  The site needs to provide NYSDOL Administrative Access. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 (Agile Development Project) Project Status: The goal of the project is to sunset the existing ETP online application, that was created in ASP with a SQL server backend, and replace it wi th an updated web based app lication with an Oracle backend. The new application can be broken down into 4 modules; Training Provider (TP), Workforce Investment Board Administration (WIB A), NYS DOL Ad min (NYS DOL A), and Job Seeker Search (JS).

The following overview details the progression through the sprints with anticipated timeframes:  Training Provider Sprints - 4 months (August 2009 through December 2009 - Done)  WIB Admin Sprints - 4 months (January 2010 through May 2010 - In Progress*)  NYS DOL Admin Sprints - 2 months (May 2010 through June 2010)  Job Seeker Sprint - 1 month (July 2010)  Production/Go-Live (August/September 2010) *The WIB Admin sprint was pushed out by a mont h. Sprint 4 accounted for the New Provider Registration, New Offerings, Manage Local List, and Crit ical Changes services. Sprint 5 will account for the Notification, Outside Offerings, Comment Histor y, and WIB Work Queue for Pending Edits Approvals. Sprint 6 will account for the Subsequent Eligibility work. Sprint Name: Data Migration; Timeline (4 week s), Started: 8/16/2010, Planned End Date: 9/10/10, Timeline Status: On Schedule, (Ahead of Schedule, On Schedule, Behind Schedule, Blocked, On-Hold) Sprint Accomplishments this Week:  Completed changes to Contact service.  Completed changes of adding Course type field on Course details page.  Completed set up for Application Logging.  Work in Progress on Data migration.  Testing and bug fixes.  Scrum sessions daily.  Conducted Customer Representative status meeting. Project impediments impacting progress and actions to mitigate: 1. We need OFT LDAP web service URL to associate Role to Training provider users. Emergency Unemployment Compensation Expansion The project will plan for and implement the ex pansion of Emergency Unem ployment Compensation (EUC), the implementation of Ex tended Benefits (EB), and the implem entation of Federal Additional Compensation (FAC - $25 weekly UI supplement). Current Status Report: 08/20/10 Changes for the cu toff of Tier IV eligibility were tested and implemented Thursday night. Changes were also installed to allow Shared Work EUC payments to continue. Our weekly meeting wi th UID was held on Thursday. Enterprise Release Management The Enterprise Release Management Project will encompasses the current Change Management environment which consists of Rational Clear Case and Clear Quest, new SOA application/services build and release disciplines and SOA applicati on/services deployment preparation. The current Rational environment needs to be modified in order to align with an enterprise build and release strategy. The build and release strategy will consist of creating a set of best practices using various tools to create an automated build and rele ase process for all the current environment’s Information Technology projects to use. This needs to be done because of the many SOA projects going on at one time. This creates a need to organize the build and release disciplines, rather than have 10 -15 or more SOA projects performing their own build and releases, which is causing wasted time and confusion among all projects.

--- Page 9 ---
Current Status Report: 08/20/10 Team completed development of ClearCase process document. Rational team reviewed document second time for the changes it suggested. Team also met with build team to explain the project objective. Federal Tax Offset This project will provide the means for the State of New York to co llect benefit over payments through participation in the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). Participation in TOP is expected to assist in collecting over $169 million in benefit overpayment s from 134,600 open benefit collection cases. Leverage the existing Statewide Offset Program (SWOP) coding and process to the greatest degree possible. Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 Program Management Project Schedule: Start Date: 4/23/2010 Planned End Date: 12/24/2010 Timeline Status: On Schedule Project Description: Develop a data warehouse extr act as the source data for sending claimant records to a mailing vendor to print UC TOP Claimant letters, mail UC TOP letters to Claimants, establish agreements with and develop initial data file and updat e process with the US Treasury, build back-end tracking and update process at NYS DOL. Status Summary: Envelopes for the Claimant mailings were received and samples were forwarded to the vendor for alignment set up and testing. UID resources are resetting the type 6 records in legacy so they will be picked up and refreshed in the data warehouse. UID intends to complete the reset by close-of- business on Wednesday to enable the data to be picked up on the extract for the warehouse. The final warehouse extract run is planned for Friday August 27th; one business day earlier than planned to allow for reruns if required. A meeting was held betw een Legacy, Database and the UI Customer to discuss a proposed solution for establishing the TOP flag in the legacy system. The suggested approach is being implemented and a test file was generated and forwarded to the legacy technical resource. The customer status meeting was held. Sprint Accomplishments This Week:  Claimant envelops were received and a sample was forwarded to the vendor.  Consensus was reached on the mainframe flag se tting approach. Changes to the system were started.  UID started the reset of the type 6 records. Project Impediments Impacting Progress and/or Risks to Mitigate: None to report. Forms Review and Revision All computer generated forms will be reviewed and re vised to the extent possible to eliminate the possibility of information security breaches. The unnecessary printing of PPSI (personal, private and sensitive in formation) on the forms will be eliminated. Particular attention will be given to PPSI on duplexed and multi-page forms. Where use of the social security number cannot be eliminated, consid eration will be given to using only the last four digits. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 No activity - still awaiting UI D's review of the sample of LO 443's mailed for one day. HR Personnel-LATS

--- Page 10 ---
The HR Personnel-LATS project is an effort to reengineer, develop and implement a modern Human Resource/Personnel and Time and Attendance syst em for the NYS Department of Labor. The new system will function as a single integrated Huma n Resource Management ( HRM) system (Personnel, Time and Attendance). It will interface directly with systems at the various control agencies so that centralized data entry can be avoided. The new system will provide a user interface that is easy to use and understand. It will offer built in capability for user defined ad hoc reports to enhance the management capabilities offered by the system. T he new system will be well established and tested by other agencies. The current HR systems in use today are mainframe based systems that have been expanded and enhanced many times ov er the years to address functionality issues as well as requirements placed on us by the NYS Office of the St ate Comptroller, NYS Department of Civil Service, and the NYS Division of the Budget. As a result of this steady stream of enhancements and new requirements, these systems are in need of an overh aul. The resulting system should meet all the needs of the control agencies as well as provide the NYS Department of Labor with a more cohesive and user friendly system for the staff in the Administrative Finance Bureau and Human Resources, as well as the employees throughout the agency that use these systems routinely. The first phase of this project is to do data gat hering regarding the current HRM systems. The NYS Department of Labor is identifying the connection points between its legacy HRM systems and other applications. A description of the data that is sent into the HRM system and what is retrieved is being documented to be used to complete the Fit-Gap with an inter-agency hosted "commercial off the shelf" solution. Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 Interfaces - The unexpected results of our interface testing were sent to the vendor. The vendor requested copies of t he files that were generated by the web services. The files from both tests were sent. The developer continues to make changes to programs that use leave codes so that they will work properly when we sw itch to the new application. An inquiry was made about a couple of reports to see if t hey are still being used. A (mainframe) software install to allow us to utilize a more secure file transfer process is schedul ed for 8/20. Technical Services will notify us when we can begin testing, hopefully the first week of September. Customer Testing - Completed a review of the interf ace testing, compiled and sent information to the vendor about the unexpected results. A status meeting was not held, but a written update was sent to the group. The heads of HR and the Administrative Finance Bureau were sent a copy of the status report. Identity Management New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) will develop standardized identity management services. The design, development and implementation of these serv ices and service strategy will take into account the various hardware platforms and software systems currently in use at NYSDOL. The services will provide a single point of reference for collection of the user identification informati on (initial registration), assignment of access keys (ID, password), user ro les and access authorization. The services will be designed for use by all NYSDOL users, both internal and external. We will partner with the Office for Technology (OFT) and other state agencies to impl ement the solution in such a way that it may be extended and reused by all New York State agencies. This enterprise approach will improve the user experience, improve information security, and increa se the effectiveness and efficiency of both person and systems resource utilization. Current Status Report: 8/20/2010 The Customer week ly meeting was conducted. Internal Workers: The development work continues. The timing is being extended for development due to unforseen complexities.

Common Authentication for Employers: Regression testing is being completed. Implementation planning continues. Training and procedure development is un derway. Current test co de was elevated to the production environment on August 17th. Statewide Effort: A proposal continues for approving Labor's process of authenticating a claimant for benefits as a trust level 2 authentication processes is being drafted. This will first need to be approved by UID and Office of Counsel before being submitted to the Statewide IdM Governance Board. External work force: Work on the architectura l recommendation is underway and should be completed next week. This will be presented in the Senior Management Meeting for review and discussion. Implement Integrated AIX TWS with zOS TWS Implement an integrated Tivoli Workload Scheduling (TWS) system that will allow DOL to manage and coordinate open system server based batch jobs from a centralized location. As data is migrated from mainframe based solutions (software and data struct ures) to server (AIX, MS Windows and other) based solutions, it is increasingly import to manage the c oordination of batch executed server processes (batch jobs) in a coordinated fashion. It is also important that we be able to setup and execute a sequence of defined processes with both regular (daily, weekly , monthly) and irregular frequency (on demand) and also to stop the execution of proc esses in the event of batch failure s and to send error notification for immediate action and/or result reporting and automated notifications . These features of batch scheduling and management are well established on the z/OS TWS system and we need to implement a similar scheduler for open systems based processes. A propos ed solution would be one that leveraged the z/OS TWS system to manage the sequencing and coordination of the server jobs (since we already have an established Production Control environment and relationshi p with OFT for support). To do this we believe we need an AIX based TWS node implemented to integrate the z/OS TWS environment. Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 Requirements gathering is un derway. A consolidated list of current batch processes is being created. Team sent the requirem ent for purchase of the tool to tech services. Information Classificati on Implementation An Information Classification effort w ill establish levels of classification fo r all information assets within the New York State Department of Labor and orderly and sy stematically assign each asset to an appropriate level of security control. Pursuant to the Federal Information Security Manage ment Act (FISMA), New York State Department of Labor must comply with Information Classification requirements as specified by Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) publication 199. Current Status Report: 8/20/10 Database staff continue pe rforming data discovery operations. The process of data discovery allows the classification tools to read the metadata of available data sources. To that metadata we will add fields for classification. InfoSphere Implementation In order to help speed the analysis, cleansing and mo vement of data from legacy systems to modernized systems, we purchased the InfoSphere Su ite of Tools. In order to realize the functionality available in this set of tools, we need to create a strategy for the implementation and continuous use of these products. Current Status Report: 8/20/2010 Some space issues have come up within the product and the team is investigating why this is happening. At the momen t, the address normalization service is not deployed

--- Page 12 ---
and is a block for another project trying to integrate it into one of our legacy applications. The team will continue to work to resolve these issues and does no t foresee a detrimental block for any one team. Job Zone OSOS Connectivity Job Zone OSOS Connectivity is a project intended to create a data bridge between the two applications which will allow real time or near real time data sharing. Customers registered in OSOS would have accounts created in Job Zone and New York Stat e customers creating Job Zone accounts would be registered in OSOS. The data common to both syst ems would move between them. When customers complete certain activities in Job Zone those activi ties would be automatically recorded in OSOS. This project is needed to address the growing number of customers seeking services from the One-Stop system at a time when resources ava ilable to provide those services are shrinking. The services currently available through Job Zone are not coordinated with se rvices that are available or provided through the One-Stop System resulting in duplicate effort bot h on the part of the customer and One-Stop staffs. Current Status Report : 08/20/10 NaviSite sent scoping questions. Staff met with DEWS to develop responses. Licensing (formerly DOSH Occupational Certificates) Recent legislation signed by Governor Paterson ma ndates that the NYS Department of Labor (DOL), Division of Safety and Health (DOSH) begin certifying pyrotechnicians, effective October, 2009. DOSH would like to use this opportunity to not only create a system to meet their immediate needs of issuing pyrotechnician certificates, but to replace their current paper, mainfr ame, and Access database systems used for processing similar types of occupational certificates (cra ne operators, blasters, and laser operators) as well. The system will allow license candidates to submit certificate applications and supplemental documentation, pay application fees, and ch eck the status of their applications, all on-line. An internal component would allow DOSH staff to complete these same tasks plus additional case management tasks of viewing, processing, and appr oving applications, scheduling competency exams, generating correspondence, running reports, recording inspection data, and recording the outcome of appeals. Finally, the system will produce a data file to be sent to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to support the printing and mailing of photo cert ificate identification cards. The scope of this project was increased to include all licenses, certific ates and permits issued by the NYS DOL and provide a full eCommerce solution designed to be easily utilized by other licensing entities. Short Term Solution: End users are entering applicat ion data in the system via the MS Access DB. Production files are being sent to the NYS DMV to generate the IDs. Long Term Solution: Focus is being revised to account for all licensing applications within the agency. The services and documentation created will be made available to other agencies for potential consumption. Current Status Report : 8/20/2010 Project Status: The team is focusing on consum able user interfaces for the numerous licenses, certifications and permits that are issued by DOL. We are also working toward optimizing the business processes to accommodate the various requirements each of these have. It is intended that the framework and documentat ion created will have the potential to be consumed by other agencies. Weekly Customer Meeting: Met with customer repr esentatives on 8/19/2010 to update them on the status of the project and progress made since the previous weekly meeting. Sprint Accomplishments this Week:

--- Page 13 ---
 Daily scrum sessions.  Continued analyzing the fram ework for the larger licenses within NYS DOL.  Functional team continued to meet with users to review /revise business process models and spent time observing the business process for specific license types.  Functional team continued to work on staff process model.  Functional team continued the identification of business process optimization points.  Development team continued adding functionality to components of the user interface.  Development team focused on changes from business analyst and customer review of screens.  Developers continued work on screen look and feel.  Development team looked into a validation approach, met with other development team and EPAS to discuss a specific approach.  Team worked on backlog items.  Continued meetings to determine areas for business process optimization. Remaining sprints for the Pyrotechnics project will include:  Sprint 7 - Continue work on GUI, Continue Bu siness Process Optimization effort, Service Candidate identification.  Sprint 8 - TBD  Sprint 9 - TBD  Sprint 10 - TBD Notification Service in WAS The Notification Service would be a generic utilit y service deployed within our WAS (Websphere Application Server) environment t hat would be consumable by all other services, and Websphere Process Server and Message Broker . This service will allow for a cons umer to pass an XML message to the Notification Service to request an email notific ation be sent out to an individual or a group. Current Status Report: Effective on or before 10/9/09, t he WAS (WebSphere Application Server) Notification service was deployed and is now fu nctional in the development environment. Now all consumers of the existing Message Broker service need to test their processes to assure the new notification service is functioning as expected. This will be a good demonstration of service transparency in our SOA environment. The WSDL in WSRR was updated to reflect the new service's endpoint and Consumers will make no changes to their code. No test consumer has been identified. NYC DYCD OSOS Data Conversion New York City (NYC) Division of Youth & Communi ty Development (DYCD) has been working with NYC Small Business Services (SBS) to develop the business requi rements and process to convert legacy data from their proprietary system into the One Stop Oper ating System (OSOS). They must develop a process to upload real time data on a regular basis (daily or weekly). They have provided a timeline and cross- walk files (available upon request). Recent info rmation from the United States Department of Labor (USDOL) indicates that reporting requirements fo r Workforce Investment Streamlined Performance Reporting (WISPR) will be implemented on 7/1/09, which means New York State will be out of compliance if the NYC youth data is not in OSOS. The NYC youth data constitute s the majority of youth data for the state. Also, the federal software for the WISPR will not provide for the inclusion of a Workforce Investment Act Standardized Record Data (WIASRD) file from NYC, which is presently used for reporting. Current Status Report: This project has been on hold since 7/10/09.

Office 2007 Upgrade This project is to upgrade the Microsoft Office product from the 2003 suite to the 2007 suite for the Department of Labor. This upgrade will enable all divisi ons to take advantage of additional functionalities and fixes. This will also simplify the task of supporting this application internally. This version will also be more stable than previous versions. Current Status Report: 07/19/10 Holding off on the push for at least three weeks. Working on the organization of OU's. Developing three different pushes of software packages to users depending on access of ABS, Letter Generator and/or fax viewer. OMH/DOL One Stop Operating System (OSOS) Partnership The NYS Office of Mental Health (OMH) has been aw arded a Medicaid Infrastructure Grant (MIG) that focuses on assisting people with disabilities of obtai n and maintain competitive jobs. The funding is made available to them by the federal Centers for Medica re and Medicaid Services and will be administered in partnership with 13 state agencies (the Office of Mental Health; the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities; Department of Health; State Office for the Aging; Education Department; Office of Alcoholism and Su bstance Abuse Services; Division of Housing and Community Renewal; Department of Transportation; O ffice of Children and Family Services; Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance; Division of Vete rans Affairs; NYS Department of Labor (NYSDOL); and the Commission on Quality of Care and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities). A partnership called the Most Integrated Settings Coordinating Council (M ISCC), containing staff from the above agencies is responsible for implementing the grant and establis hing a partnership that will assist people with disabilities to find employment. The MISCC determined that they needed a common case management system that could be used by all partners to track employment relat ed services provided to this popul ation. OMH had experience through a DOL contract with OSOS. OMH a pproached the department to disc uss the possibility of OSOS being used for this initiative. In discussions with OMH, we have tentatively planned to develop this partnership during 2010 and implement in 2011. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 Hardware sizing details are being worked out. The project scope document was created and given to OMH for sign off. OMH provided its comments. DOL Counsel office raised some significant issues with respect to UI C onfidentiality. The issues are being worked out at DOL senior management. Team is set to meet next week to discuss the requirements further. OSOS Consortium Upgrades This project will provide application enhancements requested by the One Stop O perating System (OSOS) Consortium states which include:  Additional edits and reporting changes to accommodate Stimulus Funds  Ability to change job bank job orders to ‘suspend’ status in mediated  Changes to how Inactivated Staff Administrator and office accounts are handled  Adding employer origination method The New York OSOS production application will be upgraded to v5.2 which will include these change control requests and several corrected application errors.

--- Page 15 ---
Current Status Report: 8/20/10 The Consortium states continue to work on completing user acceptance testing for v5.1. Version 5.2 was released to the demo site and made available for states to take into their test sites. The developers began work on deliver ing Federal Guidance Clarification for ARRA report changes and a low effort change to Display of SSN in Self Service Site, in a v5.2.01 patch. Business requirements for the ARRA report changes were co mpleted and sent for approval. Developers have begun working on business requirements for v5.3 . Scope Committee resolved issue for OSOS-152: Telephone Extension fields. Staff held the weekly Scope call with all participating states and the weekly status meeting with t he contracted developers. PBX Replacement - NYC The PBX equipment at 4 locations in New York City is currently functioning, but needs to be replaced. The equipment is more than 10 years old and is no longer manufactured. Spare parts and knowledgeable technicians will be increasingly difficult to find. Locations involved are 138-60 Barclay Street, Flushing; 75 Varick Street, NYC; 9 Bond Street, NYC; and 149th Street, NYC We plan to develop specifications for a system that would be appropriate for all 4 locations. If the same equipment is in place at all locations, administration will be more efficient, training easier, interconnection possible (if that becomes a requirement) and spare parts can be shared. However, we will start with the installation of only one system where it is needed most, in Flushing Queens. Once that installation has been completed, we will evaluate the equipment an d vendor prior to moving forward with another installation. Specifications will be developed bas ed on current user needs as well as potential future needs such as call center, IP and telecommuting capabilities. Current Status Report: 8/20/2010 The disapproved request for funding is being discussed at the executive level. We are evaluating other sites fo r possible system replacement. A request for 400 Oak Street is still pending, but has not progressed in several weeks. PeopleSoft Travel Software Implementation This project will allow the NYS Department of Labor (DOL) to implement/pilot Oracle/Peoplesoft Travel software purchased by the New York Financial Man agement System (NYFMS) for an on-line paperless travel system. Currently, DOL employ ees who travel must submit a paper travel voucher to receive travel reimbursement. This travel so ftware will eventually be rolled out to all state agencies. Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 Team members from Finance and Planning & Technology have reviewed a high level design and will review the docu ment for a final sign off. We had no meeting this week due to vacation schedules. Primavera Upgrade to v7.0 The Primavera P6 Enterprise Project Portfolio M anagement application needs to be upgraded to v7.0 from v6.0 to allow users and administrators to ta ke advantage of the enhancem ents and fixes that have been included. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 A Primavera technician contacted our technical services department but the Progress Reporter application has not been in stalled successfully on the development server. Safety and Loss Prevention Incentive Program

--- Page 16 ---
Chapter 6, Section 33 of the Labor Laws of 2007, titled the 2007 New York Workers' Compensation Law Reform, amended Article 7, Section 134(6-10) of the Workers' Compensation Law has charged the Commissioner of Labor with developing a workplace sa fety and loss prevention incentive program which encourages eligible employers to voluntarily implem ent a Safety Incentive Program, a Drug and Alcohol Prevention Program, and/or a Return to Work Progr am in exchange for a reduction in workers' compensation insurance premiums, or a reduction in security deposits in the case of self-insured employers. The Commissioner was given the re sponsibility for monitoring all incentive plans implemented by the employer and for establishing rules for the certification of safety and loss management specialists who perform such services. This project will assist the Division of Safety and He alth in successfully implementing this program by providing a means by which employers can view prog ram information and instructions, access samples of model incentive programs, and apply for one or more of the three incentive programs. It will also enable individuals to apply for specialist certificates in any of the three incentive areas so that they may assist employers with the development of their safety and loss prevention program. Internal DOL staff will be able to review and approve applications and monito r the on-going implementation of employers' programs. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 Project team completed three services: RetrieveInsuranceCarrierList RetrieveAllWorkerCompensations and RetrieveWorker CompensationDetails. This last service was integrated with the GUI. The employer service wa s further modified so we can add the Workers' Compensation carrier's address. Some of the static pages needed for the customer demo were completed. The BA continued working on test cases. T he customer was not available to attend the status meeting. Service Center Procedures This project includes the installation of the inter nal and external Knowledge Base modules of the Service Center Application, which utilizes Numara FootPrints version 8.1. It also includes the development of additional reports created within the FootPrints struct ure. If FootPrints is un able to provide the required reports, other tools will be considered such as Crysta l Reports or Cognos software. In addition, desk-to- desk procedures with the Office for Technology's Help Desk will be documented. New York State Department of Labor already owns the product and has an adequate number of licenses to complete these enhancements. Current Status Report: 8/13/10 The original project basically had been completed, but we are retooling the Service Center Application (A -Info). The entire project is be ing reviewed for changes to meet managements latest concerns in additional to changes that we see would be beneficial to our organization. Much of the primary Service Center Ap plication is completed; we are currently working on the escalation processes and blending in the change management application into the main project. Impediment: We are having difficulties finding time to work on our projects and still run the day to day business including incident management. Software Tracking Establish a process to track the location and use of all purchased DOL software licenses. This is needed to ensure we know where our licensed software is locat ed, who it is assigned to, and that it is actually being used. In addition this will provide a means to accu rately account for all the software and to verify it is used in compliance with the terms of each license. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 The regularly scheduled import of all System Center Configuration Management (SCCM) files occurred. One additional As set Manager client was deployed on a Unix server last week, and two clients were deployed on laptop co mputers. There were no new clients installed on

--- Page 17 ---
Windows servers. Followed up with the Office For Te chnology (OFT) on deploying Asset Manager clients on hosted servers and alternat ives to deploying it to desktop comput ers. OFT is still investigating. Installed the new Inventory Manager software on a serv er. Working with the vendor to resolve access issues. State Financial System OSC Bulkload Certification This project is to modify the NYSDOL’s accounting sy stem (FARS) so that DOL can continue to interface with the Office of the State Controller (OSC ) using OSC’s new State Financial System. Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 The project team performed the following tasks this reporting period:  Conducted weekly meeting to report progress of project.  Held daily scrums.  Turned over testing of NY71 vendor screen pr ogramming UPDATE and ADD testing to users.  Install of mainframe Uncombine changes completed.  WIA Uncombine testing to start next week.  Continued work on IN43 screen changes.  Continued work on PC22 screen changes.  Reviewed the CA5MEALS job.  Created a 2nd version of the Changes to FARS do cument that eliminates items that were crossed out and to update dates.  M161 reports sent to users for review. Corrections made based on feedback  Continued to investigate problems with data not transmitting properly.  Attended SFS Bulkload Q&A session. Telephone Call Center Collaboration Assessment The purpose of this project is to investigate opportuni ties for call center collaboration with other New York State governmental entities and to implement call cent er collaboration beginning with the New York State Insurance Fund. The New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) has an established and mature call center operation with resources that could possibly be shared at an overall savings to the State. The NYSDOL telephony infrastructure currently suppor ts over 300 call center agents in three agency locations; Albany, NY, Glendale, NY, and Troy, NY. NYSDOL’s potentially sharable assets include:  Call Center Infrastructure – Telephony hardware and software, i.e., trunks, servers, switches, Computer Telephony Integration (C TI), Interactive Voice Response, (IVR), outbound dialing, etc., as well as applications to be installed by t he end of State Fiscal Year 2009-2010 which will manage call prioritization, on-hold scheduled call back, and web chat.  Call Center Agent Human Resources – trained staff are available to accept and direct calls, and perform real-time inquires and updates on behalf of callers. Any or all of the above assets have the potential to be shared. NYSDOL might collaborate with another governmental entity by sharing Call Center Agents. Voice ports, CTI, IVR, outbound dialing, on-hold scheduled call back or web chat might be sh ared individually or in any combination. Current Status Report: 8/20/2010 The Customer weekly meeting was postponed due to vacation. The policy and procedure document draft is complete. The document is being vetted. Comments are being reviewed and the document adjusted. Trade Act MIS

--- Page 18 ---
The NYS Department of Labor (DOL) has applied for a grant for improvements to technology related to data collection for the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program. Eighty percent of this grant money will be set aside to implement a new TAA Case Managem ent System. Work is in the early stages of analysis and documentation of the current work proc ess and data flow. The Workforce Development & Training division intends to continue their current acti vities through to the development and release of a new system. Once the system is released, the need for their services will be drastically reduced. The planned TAA Management System will replace and in tegrate multiple stand- alone data systems used to administer and report on the TAA program Current Status Report: 8/20/10 Project Status: The new petition, petition notes, claimant, application, document creation, claimant determination, and part s of the waiver modules have been deployed to the test site. The TAA project completed development fo r Waiver, except for incorporating changes for the common human task service. The LDAP entitle ments have been created by the NYS Office for Technology (OFT), the project team is working on in tegrating the Identity Management Service into the code for the Petition Module. The team continued to work with the xPression group to finalize document templates. The team continues to plan for PeopleSo ft integration for the financial sections; the project began developing funding screens and designing fund request process in relation to the Job Search/Relocation Allowance and Training modules. T he project team held the weekly status meeting with the customer. Project Impediment: The project team is awaiting de ployment of a generic human task service to the development environment. The team cannot complete the waiver module or the fund request modules until the human task service is completed.

--- Page 19 ---
Sprint Status: Project team began work on tec hnical design for the training fund request. Sprint Accomplishments: The database tables were created in the test environment. The service model was created and process m odels have been started. Sprint Impediments: None Transfer of NYS Job Bank from AJE to JobCentral NLX Replace the current NYS Job Exchange hosted by AJE to a new site to be hosted by JobCentral National Labor Exchange (NLX). We have had escalating problems with AJE due to ongoing changes being made to make the site self-supporting and/or profitable. Thes e changes include the charging of fees for service to both job seekers and employers, advertising, move of the customer support services to India, and expanding partnerships with other fee-charging job sites allowing more listings that are suspect. There is little to no notice of significant changes being made to the site and insufficient firewall protections between the NYS hosted site and the national public site. In addition, AJE has taken the position that they 'own' the employer job order data from employer regist ered with the NYS site. This is in conflict with the state's understanding when the hosting arrangement was made. Note that New Jersey has already severed their relation with AJE for this reason an d we understand that Kentucky is moving in that direction as well. At the same time we have seen major improvements to the JobCentral NLX site. Since inception the JobCentral site has grown significant ly and now has the participation of as many more states than AJB had prior to termination (while AJE has comparatively few states participating at this point). Through the JobCentral as sociation with NASWA, the needs of the public labor exchange and the State's participation on the JobCentral operatio ns committee have direct input into changes and enhancements made to the site. JobCentral limits the sour ces of jobs coming into the NLX, thus providing the states with more protection against the types of problems seen with AJE. In addition, JobCentral staff is much more responsive to requests from states and offer many other advantages thru their association with NASWA and their employer membership. This change has been approved by executive level staff. In addition, Counsel's office has agreed that this chan ge is within the terms of the current contracts that NYSDOL has with both Navisite/AJE and DEA/JobCentral NLX, so no additional procurement process steps are needed. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 The weekly customer status meeting was held on Wednesday at 12:30 pm. Data Exchange Out from OSOS was changed to JC on 7/29 and are conducting post-project clean-up. JobCentral assigned their own origination method codes to jobs that send to OSOS. Since all of the JobCentral jobs in OSOS changed, it took more than a day to load the file. UI Additional Claims on Web The purpose of this project is to add functionality to the UI Benefits Web application for additional claims. Current Status Report : 08/13/10 The development team, analysts and functional managers have agreed upon the high level requirements and approach for the project. The technical lead is working on a shell prototype. UI Address Normalization Project The purpose of this proposal is to initiate a projec t to add functionality to the UI Benefits Web application for address normalization. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 Address Normalization serv ice design was discussed with the appropriate architecture resources. It was decided to forgo building in an extra level of abstraction for the service and stick with the architect ed solution from the Proof of Concept.

--- Page 20 ---
The address files that support the Address Normalizati on service are only valid for a short period of time. In trying to resurrect the Proof of Concept, it was discovered that these addres s files have both expired and need to updated. Since the department has not yet purchased these address files, we need to continue to receive 'evaluation' copies from the vendor. Until such time as the purchase is completed, this will be a continuing problem. Database is aware of this issue and is working towards a resolution. UI Appeal Board Replacement The purpose of this project is to create a UI Appeals Board system and proc esses which will improve NYSDOL's ability to provide quality and flexible services to Claimants and Employers. The new system will replace the current Cúram-based system with a m odernized, service oriented application. It will also provide desired improvem ents and enhancements. The completed app lication will provide DOL staff the ability to work more effectively and efficiently by aut omating business activity to reduce redundancy and errors, create electronic files and forms and automate the implementation of hearing decisions to reduce cycle time. It will also create an Appeals Board system t hat will provides a self-s ervice portal for various customer needs, such as: protest monetary and non- monetary determinations; provide customers with status updates; provide the functionality to withdraw a hearing or an appeal, as well as functionality for effected parties to read hearing and appeal decisions and request an appeal of those decisions. This project will also provide a mechanism for an employer to proceed to an Informal Conference for a hearing request based on an audit det ermination. This project will also pr ovide NYSDOL users with electronic hearing files, eliminating the manual routing of paper hearing cases. Current Status Report 8/20/10 Project Status: The Project Team is working thr ough the tasks of Sprint One, which includes the development of the screens for the Claimant portion of the New York Use Case: Complete a Hearing Request and the preparation of the Use Case Specification Documents for the Employer portion of the Use Case. The Project Manager and the Business Analys ts are working with Customer Representatives from the Appeal Board, Unemployment Insurance an d the Adjudication Services Office to finalize the additions and adjustments needed to satisfy New York’s requirements. The Executive Secretary for the Appeal Board, the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the Project Manager, the Staff Supervisor and the Business Analysts completed the review of the Cl aimant screens to Complete a Hearing Request. The Chief Administrative Law Judge agreed to provide th e team with additional information concerning the mandated languages for Web Page translations, l egal documents and Appeal Board communications. The Executive Secretary plans to schedule a m eeting with Appeal Board personnel and members of Planning and Technology to discuss plans to coordinate the efforts of the Appeal Board, the Re-Write Project Team and the Legacy Maintenance Team to provide assistance to improve efficiency for case processing. The Weekly Customer meeting was held as scheduled. Sprint Name: Sprint One: Appeal Board ReWrite Development - NYUseCase1027 Comp lete a Hearing Request (Claimant) Preparation. Sprint Timeline (6 weeks). Starts: 7/28/2010 Plann ed End Date: 9/8/2010 Timeline Status: On Schedule (Ahead of Schedule, On Schedule, Behind Schedule, Blocked, On-Hold) Sprint Status: The Project Team resolved an issue related to the implementation of the GUI validation framework, collaborated with the User Representati ves to finalize the Use Case requirements for the Claimant and conducted an initial review of the em ployer screens. Daily scrums are being held. Sprint Accomplishments this week: The Developers worked with the Enterprise Architect who developed the GUI Framework Validation to resolve an issue with the implementation in the Appeal Board project. The Developers began to incorporate Exception Ha ndling standards into the implementation of the screens. The Project Manager and the Developers participated in Scrum Master training with the Consultant who has been performing that function for several of the Modernization Developer Teams. The Business Analyst incorporated the feedback from the Unemployment Insurance and the Adjudication Services Office User representatives concerning the initial review of the Employer screens for Completing

a Hearing request. The Team participated in daily scrums and team meetings for further guidance and coordination. Project Impediments Impacting Progress and Actions to Mitigate: None at this time UI Audit and Investigation Case Management System The purpose of this project is to re-design the Case Management System (CMS) currently used by UI Tax Enforcement Staff. The project in cludes automating the se lection of audits and investigations, manual requests for investigations, routing the assignmen ts to the correct enforcement staff, transferring assignments between offices an d staff, facilitate the scheduling of field staff appointments, allowing enforcement supervisors to manage assignments, and providing workfl ow for supervisory and Quality Assurance review of comple ted assignments. The Case Management System is a mainframe base d system that contains cases that have been automatically selected for follow-up work enforcement work. There are a number of reasons why a case might be selected. Examples are for Failure to File (FTF) a wage report, or for a delinquent wage report. Not all cases are selected automatically. Some ar e manually generated, such as Miscellaneous cases and Liability cases, and must be keyed in by the Central Assignment and Collection unit (CACS) staff. The follow up work in the Case Management System mi ght be work performed in the Central Assignment and Collection unit, (a UI Tax Enforcement unit) or an assignment to be handled in the field by UI Tax Services. The Case Management System was not co mpleted when it was originally built. It does not include Benefit Claims Investigations and Collection A ssignments. Bank Levies are also not in the Case Management System. Bank Levies are handled exter nal to CMS in a Microsoft Access Bank Levy application. The Bank Levy System records pertinent information about employers bank accounts, warrants placed against employers, and levies sent to banks to collect against employers’ accounts, and the status of those levies. This project will also develop a portable computer syst em to facilitate field work done by UI Tax Auditors and Tax Compliance Agents, and replace the current Tax Services Database Management System (TSDBMS). This includes data gathering via keyboard input and file import, calculations of amounts due, estimation of amounts due, collection of amounts due, penalty and interest calculations, report generation, data upload and download with primary UI syst em, forms generation, daily activities reporting, electronic signature capture, and calendar synchronization. The current Tax Services Database Management Syst em was developed using Microsoft Access. It is deployed on laptops that UI Tax Auditors and Tax Compliance Agents bring into the field to record the results of their assignments. The UI Tax Audito rs and Tax Compliance Agent s receive their assignments as paper printouts sent from the Central Assignm ent and Collection Services unit (CACS). The data enter the assignment information into TSDBMS. Manual input of employer information wastes Field Staff and employer time, and is subject to keying errors. The results of each field assignment are printed. Investigation assignments ar e mailed to the District Supervisor, who reviews each assignment. Afterw ard, the District Super visor sends the reviewed assignment paperwork to the central office for Qualit y Assurance unit review. Audit assignments are sent directly to the CACS. The need to print and mail co mpleted assignment paperwork wastes paper, time, and postage. Some information is uploaded from the field staffs’ TSDBMS to a server, where it is downloaded into to the Microsoft Access based system called the Assignment Register. The Assignment Register maintains a history of field assignments and is used for Federal and NYS reporting. Current Status Report: 8/20/10 (Agile Development Project) Project Status: Phase two includes enhancements to the query system (ledger details, address [physical and mailing] synchronization, incorp orating addresses in searches), required changes identified during the pilot of release one and development of the assignm ent workflow system. Sprints four through eight

are now complete. Sprint four accomplishments incl ude: system requirements s pecification (SRS), user interface specification and business rules, technica l artifacts (system context model, component model, architectural overview diagram, GUI prototype, service model, architectural decision document) and service specifications. The business calendar and ID generator utility components were completed. A proof of concept (POC) was done for forms digitization (five forms). Sprint five was an abbreviated three week effort that concentrated on modifications and enhancements to release one (name search refinements, address search, quarterly reporting history from ledger, flags on employer profile) while we worked with EPAS to finalize some design decisions need ed to move forward with the project. Sprint six included a new search using NAICS code, incorporating some additional business rules for the quarterly reporting history from ledger screen and preparation of test scenarios and test scripts for UAT. Sprint seven included A&I v1.1 implementation and the star t of core functional foundation development based on the PA assets. Sprint eight focused on redesi gning the core components for Case Management (liable employer, claim and audit case) and Interested Party Management (employer, worker and TPA) to service enable them. A weekly meeting is held wi th the customer to discuss the project status. The team is working on building core foundation pieces (core case management, core workflow, core interested party management, etc.) for the modernized system using the PA assets. Development of the assignment workflow system will follow and will build on these. Sprint Name: Sprint Nine: Core Functional Foundation Development - Case Management and Interested Party Management Service Delivery. Sprint Time line (6 weeks). Starts: 7/19/2010 Planned End Date: 8/27/2010 Timeline Status: On Schedule (Ahead of Sc hedule, On Schedule, Behind Schedule, Blocked, On-Hold) Sprint Status: The team's efforts have shifted to build core functional foundation pieces (core case management, core workflow, core interested party management, etc.) for the modernized system using the PA assets. These will be used by the A&I system and others. The goal for this sprint is to deliver Case Management (CMS) and Interested Party Management (IPM) uses cases with respect to employer registration, claimant registration and profile management. Development continued with Release 2 versions of IPM Create Employer, Get Employer, Update Employer, Search Employer, Create Worker, Get Worker, Update Worker, Search Worker, Cr eate TPA, Get TPA, Update TPA and Search TPA, Create Predecessor/Successor Association, Create Owner Officer, Search Owner Officer and Get Owner Officer now completed. Development is also comp lete for Release 2 CMS search cases (by Case ID, Worker IP ID, Worker Last Name and SSN, Claimant IP ID, Audit Case and Liable Employer Case). Code review, refactoring, integration with the new UCMS DBA3 schema and unit testing are in progress. The team is creating NY versions of the PA use cases for CMS and IPM. The team is also finishing up working with the database group to maintain additions and changes to the physical and mailing addresses in the enterprise database. Additionally the core team has created a service specification for the Address Verification service and is working with the UI Address Normalizati on project to create the service(s) required. Daily scrums are being held. Sprint Accomplishments this week: Monitoring of the latest A&I release (v1.1) and work on maintaining daily additions and changes to the addresses in the enterprise database. With the latest hardware update, the A&I application has been successfully prom oted to the first level of the new environment and is now being upgraded to WAS 7.0. The A&I Us er Manual (v2.1) update has been finalized and distributed to field staff. Work on utilizing the core functional foundation pieces for the PA assets continued for Case Management and Interested Party Management. Use cases were completed for Create Employer Record, Create TPA Record, Create Worker Record, Create Association, Update Association and Create Pr edecessor/Successor Association. Completed development and testing of Create Owner Officer, Get Owner Officer and Search Owner Officer. Project Impediments Impacting Progress and Actions to Mitigate: None at this time UI Benefit Adjudication

--- Page 23 ---
This project will redesign processes related to the ad judication of non-monetary issues. At the present time, claim issues are identified automatically bas ed upon information supplied when the claimant files the claim through the Internet or the phone, once the cl aimant has completed the claim, the information is submitted to one of the Mainframe applications ca lled Unemployment Benefits Wage Reporting system (UBWR). Every morning the Telephone Claims Center s (TCCs) download claims with issues from the UBWR system into a Microsoft Access system whic h is referred to as Case Management. Once the UBWR data is in Case Management, the adjudication units sort and query the information based on their assignment needs. For example, the Adjudication Unit s will sort the Case Management data by the last 4 digits of the Social Security Number and assign them to adjudicators within specific ranges (e.g., from 0000 to 1054). Adjudications Units will also sort t he Case Management data into Spanish claims (Local Office 809, 839, 889), or all the claims with a given effective date. Assignments are given to adjudicators via the Ca ses Management System. The adjudicators accept cases, and annotate results in the Microsoft Access Case Management System. To adjudicate claims issues, adjudicators frequently contact claimants and employers to gather information needed to make eligibility determinations. They may call either part y, or send forms or questionnaires to obtain information. When adjudicators take statements via telephone, they transcribe the statement into forms that exist in the Letter Generator System. Thos e forms are automatically imaged and saved with the claimant’s imaged file. When adjudicators request wr itten information, they later look for written responses from claimants by manually searching the File Access Facility (FAF), to see if correspondence or questionnaires were returned and imaged. Adjudicators view UBWR mainframe inquiry screens, and run COGNOS reports to research information that was reported when claimants filed their Original Claim. This is done to compare it to statements made to the adjudicators. In instances where there are discrepancies, the adjudicators send the COGNOS re ports to be imaged by UI Division Central Support to be added to the claimants image file. The current automated method of supporting claims adjudication is inefficient. Much time is lost in adjudicating claims, and information is not fully captur ed or used to automatically drive the process. Information is stored in disparate nonintegrated sy stems, and is frequently captured only in image form, rather than as data. Information needed by adjudi cators is spread across the FAF system, UBWR system, Case Management System, and Voice/W eb system (accessed via COGNOS). Many applications in use are no longer supported. Current Status Report: 8/20/2010 (Agile Development Project) Project Status: The adjudication team held a conference call with the state of New Jersey to discuss their upcoming implementation of the f ederal Separation Information Database System (SIDES). We also continued analysis of adjudication systems require ments, assessed and validated Pennsylvania non- monetary use cases, worked on creation of Pennsylvani a-style 'smart forms', collaborated with the user interface development team and continued discussion with the multi-state consortium. We are consolidating the lessons learned from the SIDES c onference and the discussions with New Jersey and with the third party agent company. Goals, activities and deliverables for the next sprint are being planned. Business customers were updated with project status and progress. Sprint Name: between sprints. Sprint Timeline ( ) Start Date: Planned End Date: Timeline Status: (Ahead of Schedule, On Schedule, Behind Schedule, Blocked, On-Hold) Between-Sprint Status: Technical staff continued system and data analysis. Business analysts continued use case review, fit gap analysis and issue resolution. Sprint Accomplishments this Week:  Continued PA asset use case and interface review and analysis.  Analyzed adjudication systems and data flow.  Held discussions with New Jersey to learn about their impending SIDES implementation. Project Impediments Impacting Progress and Actions to Mitigate: None.

UI Benefit Ledger Replacement This project will replace the current Claimant Benefit Ledger with a newer, and easier to use ledger. The current ledger was written several decades ago and is no longer able to efficiently handle today’s UI Benefits business. Pr ogramming maintenance is ri sky because code has been pi eced together over many years. Also, a great deal of informat ion currently stored on the ledger is not financial information. This project will separate information currently stored on th e claimant ledger into the financial transaction information and the employer charging information. Beca use this data is interrelated, a relationship must be created to provide the ability to view employer charges associated with a payment and view payments associated with an employer’s charges. Currently, few adjustments to the ledger are automated. Most require UI staff to calculate the adjustment amounts and enter the transactions into a batch update process. There are limited edits on the entries; therefore, transactions are frequent ly rejected during the batch run because the transactions do not balance. Adjustment transactions will be calculated and posted to the ledger automatically in as many cases as possible. UI staff will be able to post transa ctions on-line that cannot be posted automatically. Other processes that use the ledger information may require interface capabilities, such as the overpayment system, jump keys that access the led ger, and the master file build. In addition, OTDA also accesses this information. Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 Agile Development Schedule: POC Sprint: June 21, 2010 until Sept 30, 2010: In Progress Status Summary: The team identified the Post Rece ivables to Ledger and the Pay Benefits Use Cases to be modeled and presented to UID customer. The proj ect EPAS resource has exec uted code for the Post Receivable to Ledger. Additional questions were generated and documented for the PA Architect. A spreadsheet was started that will document what methods are calling other components. The team is close to understanding the ledger update proces s. The customer status meeting was held. Accomplishments: Two transaction types for presentation to the custom er were identified. Modeling of the Employer and Benefit s Use Cases and transactions continued. UI Benefits Certification This project is intended to re-design of all of the pr ocesses associated with weekly certification for regular UI benefits. It also includes the re-des ign of all of the processes associated with weekly certification for UI special programs including shared wo rk, TRA, DUA and SEP. This proj ect will leverage the existing voice web platform to implement the enhancements designed by UISIM for the processe s associated with UI weekly certifications. It includes modifying the existing platform to allow self-servi ce web certifications for shared work claimants/empl oyers, TRA claimants, SEP claimants and DUA claimants currently accepted in paper form only. This project will add the necessa ry front end screens/rules/logic and backend logic to process certifications on-line for all of the special programs clai mants. The special programs certification functionality includes an on-line application for shared work employers to submit weekly certifications on behalf of their shared work employees. The design allo ws the employer to complete one certification for all of the employees at once. Today, the shared work employer is required to complete the bottom portion the paper certification separately for each employ ee. It also includes the enhancements to the certification application to collect last employer information for additional claims. This project will also upgrade the weekly certificatio n application on the voice web platform to allow for missed certification weeks on the web. Currently, when a claimant forgets to certify for a given week and then calls to certify the next week they need to speak wi th a TCC representative to submit the certification

--- Page 25 ---
for the missed week. Once the ski p week functionality is implemen ted, the system will accept the certification for the missed (skip) week without human intervention. Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 (Agile Development Project) Backlog Item: File Continued Claim Internet (R3USE790) Sprint 8: File a Clean Certification: Timeline (TBD) Started: 8/12/2010, Planned End Date: 9/30/2010, Timeline Status: On Schedule (Ahead of Schedule, On Schedule, Behind Schedule, Blocked, On-Hold) Sprint 8 Overview: File a Clean Certification: Deliverables: Update Use Case R3USE790 to reflect processes for filing a single week clean certificat ion, documented screen validations, updated business rules in iLog, analysis to determine first alternate path to be developed in the next sprint, Technical Specifications (Service Architecture, Domain Model , Data Model, Service Specification), prototypes modified to reflect updated Use Case, data model mapped to business object model. Sprint Status: Primavera scheduling for Sprint 8 wa s completed this week. The Business Analysts have started updating the Use Case documentation and docu menting the screen validations. Some progress was impacted this week due a 3 day absence of the lead Business Analyst who was attending a conference. Service analysis and design continued this week for development of the Service Model. A cross reference of business objec ts to the data model was develop ed. This cross reference will be validated and updated according to a new PA code drop anticipated to be delivered in late August. The customer status meeting was held. Sprint Accomplishments this Week:  Service design was started.  Primavera activity scheduling for Sprint 8 was completed.  Updates to R3USE790 Use Case were started. Project Impediments Impacting Progress and Actions to Mitigate: None UI Benefits Intake The Unemployment Insurance Benefits Intake (UI Ben In take) project is one of many projects in the larger Unemployment Insurance System Impr ovement (UISIM) initiative. This project is intended to take an agile approach to the enhancement, or re-design, of the processes associated with intake for regular UI benefits including the Remote Initial Claims (RIC) application. Some of the existing procedures fo r processing claims are paper driv en, manual processes. Other existing systems were built with technology that is no longer supported. This poses a potential risk of not being able to fully recover from a system failure. The migration of targeted mainframe programs and database structures is essential to continue to pr ovide claimants with the ability to submit an original claim. The first major deliverable of this project will be Shared Work. It will be conducted as a sub-project of the overall Benefit Intake project. It will produce 3 major deliverables: 1) Implement the Shared Work question on the Web Original Claim system to enable Shared Work Claimants to submit self service Unemployment Insurance claims 2) Enable upload of employers' Shared Work Plans 3) Enable the UI Division to add and maintain the employers' Shared Work Plans. Current Status Report: 8/20/2010 (Agile Development Project) Project Status for UI Benefits Intake: Work cont inues to get the Shared Work application and related components working on the Staging servers. Perfor mance testing was conducted and the results are being reviewed. The Claimant Profile and Preference Management team has reviewed the GUI with the

--- Page 26 ---
analysts and a business customer review is scheduled for next week. The Initial Claim-Employment History team has identified the initial claim databa se and is working to identify the accuracy and completeness of the schema. Sprint Name: Intake-SW2-9 -Develop next release of the Shared Work Application for Shared Work Unit Sprint Timeline: Planned End Date: 6/4/2010, Timeline Status: Open Sprint Status: The Shared Work Team is working with Technical Services, Release Management and Enterprise Architect Staff to properly configure se rvers for the Shared Work web application and related components on the Staging servers. The Performanc e Testing Team is compiling the testing results and will schedule discussion with the entire team. The Dat abase Team is assisting in troubleshooting an issue with the SW scheduler that is needed to delete bo okmarked plans that have never been submitted. Impediments Impacting Progress and Actions to Mitigate:  The employer role user acceptance testi ng cannot be scheduled until the Common Authentication is available.  The siteminder logout process has been found to be not working according to the required behavior. The team architect is working with the OFT resource to change it to the required behavior. This will impact other web applications.  There is a 4 hour active session timeout limit. This is not acceptable to the user community. This is a policy decision under discussion by upper management. A decision is expected on this next week. Sprint Name: Intake - Claimant Profile & Preference Management - Sprint 1 - Complete Claimant Profile and Preference Management. Sprint Timeline: (6 weeks) Start Date: 7/20/2010 Planned End Date: 8/30/2010, Timeline Status: Open Sprint Status: The Business Analysts met with the customers on Tuesday and provided them with a demo of the Profile and Preferences GUI. The analysts are now in the process of creating a screenshot flow for a final review for the users. In addition, the PA use cases are being updated to reflect the NY business. EPAS has complet ed the review of the technical spec ification document and have made some suggestions that are still pending within their group. They will next review the wsdl/xsds. The service developers are coding and are working on integrating with the interested party service developed by the core team. Some delays have been encountered for the profile team as a result of coding/environment issues with the core team. The solution architect is working on a collective effort with the other teams to standardize the transformation of the wsdl/xsds. The GUI developers are continuing to work on validations and incorporating changes requested by the analysts. All code is still residing locally on developer desktops. Impediments Impacting Progress and Actions to Mitigate:  The Clearcase stream is not yet available fo rcing both the 2 GUI developers and the 2 Service developers to work directly from their desktops and manually sync up their code. Scrum Master has reported the problem to management and the te am architect is requesting a date from the Clearcase group. In the mean time, developers ar e syncing up their code at the end of each business day.  The instability of the code from the core team and having a proper deployment in dev. The profile team is stubbing out the sections as necessary to move forward during this sprint. The core team has relayed that their issues should be resolved by COB Monday, August 23. Sprint Name: Intake - Initial Claim-Employment Hist ory Sprint 0 - Military and Federal Employment History Sprint Timeline: Start Date: 8/3/2010 Planne d End Date: 8/31/2010, Timeline Status: Open

--- Page 27 ---
Sprint Status: The technical specifications docu ment for the Federal Employment (UCFE), Military Employment (UCFX) are complete and have been revi ewed by the team. It has been discovered that the Search Federal Employer will be reused by many of the Benefits sub domains. Technical analysis to identify the ICON interface specifications and requ irements to send and receive messages has begun. Analysis of the Employment History related domain a ttributes to map to the database attributes and user interface prototype attributes has begun. The Employment History service operations as well as Core operations have been identified. This will be used to create the service specifications needed to begin service development. The PA user interface prototypes for the Employment History use cases have been converted to NY prototypes. Impediments Impacting Progress and Actions to Mitigate: none UI Benefits Web Chat The purpose of this proposal is to initiate a projec t to add Web Chat functionality to the UI Benefits Web application for claimants. Current Status Report: 8/20/2010 The Customer meeting was postponed due to vacations. We are tracking the progress for IC upgrade which needs to be completed prior to Web Chat going live. A demonstration to the Unemployment Insurance division is scheduled for next week. UI eFile Core Application & Address Change This is a joint agency project where the NYS Depart ment of Labor (Labor) and the NYS Department of Taxation and Finance (DTF) are collaborating to deliver an Internet application for the electronic filing of the NYS-45, Quarterly Combined Withholding, Wage Re porting and Unemployment Insurance return, in compliance with the US Department of Labor grant proposal which will partially fund the project. The application will give a population of 500,000 employers and 20,000 tax preparers the option to: complete and file the NYS-45 quarterly return through a w eb application, make electronic payments, upload employee wage information and report a change of address via a separate web application. Current Status Report: 8/20/2010 The application continues to perform well without any major issues encountered. Volumes continue to increase at varying rates each filing period. UI Employer Home Page - Consolidated Accts Receivable The Scope of this project is to expand the functiona lity of the Employer Home Page application, which is a live application used by NYS empl oyers seeking information rega rding their account with the Department of Labor. The current application displays profile and rate information. The UI division has identified the first enhancements they would like to add to the Employer Home Page. They are: the addition of benefit charge information, to tal accounts receivable and list of NYS45's that are delinquent. The addition of this information will reduce the bur den of L&D and EAAS staff responding to employer inquiries. Benefit Charges: The application will display charge amount, credit charges, last 4 digits of SSN of claimant, charge date, LO400 and IA96 form date. Th e application will allow a search, sort ability. Accounts Receivable: The applicati on will display the total amount owed by the employer including quarterly return amounts, penalties, interest to date an d rate at which interest is accruing. In addition, directions on how to pay along with payment documen ts and the list of NYS45's that are delinquent will be added to the screen.

--- Page 28 ---
Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 (Agile Development Project) Project Status: The project will allow employers to view their accounts rece ivable status and benefit charge information on the employer home page once they have authenticated th emselves through Labor Online Services (Common Authentication). The team has completed the development and testing of the Accounts Receivable display functionality and will im plement it two weeks after the Labor On-Line Services (Common Authentication Project) is in produ ction and stable (currently estimated for the end of June). The team has completed development of the app lication and the application functionality has been accepted by the users. However, none of the new functionality ca n be implemented until employers can authenticate who they are through Labor On-line Se rvices. The project will remain open until the application is successfully deployed to production, and some minor operational activities still need to occur but no new sprints will be started. A Customer Meeting was held this week to update them on the status of the project. Sprint Name: Complete development of the application code to display Benefit Charge information, record protest flags and retrieve IA-96 forms stored in OnDemand and put the code through User Acceptance testing. Sprint Timeline N/A days, Started: N/A, Planned E nd Date: N/A, Timeline Status: The sprint ended on 3/31. Sprint Status: The sprint ended without being abl e to implement the code in production. Activities completed this Week: Corrected add ress caching problem that was found during ad-hoc testing. The corrected code was promoted to Production and validated. Project Impediments Impacting Progress and Actions to Mitigate: None UI Employer Maintain Profile Information This project will leverage the Pennsy lvania assets (to the extent possibl e) and existing UISIM artifacts to capture Employer registration and profile information, and maintain it in the new Employer data model. The new data model will be built based on the PA. data model. Wire frame screens will be developed from the PA assets and presented to the users to va lidate the PA use cases and other analysis artifacts. The validated artifacts will then be used along with the existing code to develop the Registration and Profile maintenance services for N YSDOL. The project will also inco rporate the deliverables from the proposed project named UI Employer Employer Account Adjustment Section (EAAS) Transfer Experience. Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 (Agile Development Project) Project Status: The project will deliver the processes related to an employer registering with DOL first as a customer, second as a Unemployment Insurance empl oyer, and third to maintain the employer's account (name, address, agents, prefer ences etc.) while they are a business in NYS. Sprint Goals: Complete Validations and Error messages for the Agricultural employer screens. Develop screens for Business and Domestic employers. Cr eate Staging tables. Develop requirements for an Employer landing page and storing evidence. Customer Meeting - A Customer Meeting was held this week to update them on the status of the project.

Sprint Timeline six weeks, Started: 8/19/2010, Plan ned End Date: 9/01/2010, Timeline Status: Currently on schedule. Sprint Status: We are currently one week into the sp rint and currently scheduled to complete on time. Sprint Accomplishments this Week:  Worked on coding the screen validations fo r the Agricultural employer screens.  Worked on developing Staging tables from the Pennsylvania data m odel for storing the intermediate Registration data.  Worked on finalizing the User Interface specif ications for the Agricultural employers.  Worked on developing the User Interface sp ecifications for the Business and Domestic employers.  Worked on developing the Business and Household Liability screens, the Business Location and Confirmation screens, and the Te chnical Difficulties screen.  Worked on developing the process model for us e case 6 and use case 7 from Pennsylvania. Project Impediments Impacting Progress and Actions to Mitigate: None UI Employer Registration This project will encompass the m odernization of the UI employer registration process. The scope includes core processing for new registrations from all employer types, providing new interfaces for the various sources of registration, and employer profile maintenance. Core processing will include an automated search of the Department of Labor and the Department of Taxation and Finance (DTF) databases to determine if the employer already exists. It also includes automated rules to determine if the sy stem can register the employer, rules for the system to determine liability and check for reimbursable type employers, and system creat ion and management of workflow when human tasks are required. The to-be processes will be modeled using the IBM Business Process Modeler. After refinement in conjunction with the architect group, the developers and integration team will import the models into their development tools to complete the business process development. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 (Agile Development Project) Project Status: UI Employer Registration Compos ite Application has been deployed to the Production Environment and is currently accepting Employer Regist rations from the Governor's Office of Regulatory Reform (GORR). Sprint Name: UI Employer Registration Go-Live; Timeline (5 weeks), Started: 6/07/2010, Planned End Date: 07/14/10, Timeline Status: Behind Schedule, (Ahead of Schedule, On Schedule, Behind Schedule, Blocked, On-Hold) Sprint Accomplishments this Week:  Continued to process and monitor all GORR XMLs in the new Registration Automated system.  Fixed the Scheduler Service; it was making duplic ate calls to the servic e, causing the duplicate records in the database.  Emergency Request for deployment was sent. (Issue is resolved)  Bugs Fixed: o Unable to determine liability bug.

 Email Sent to all the EREG users for their acce ss to EREG System Going live this week. (Two users are having issues)  Working on Automation Tally Emails for Accession & Updates. Project impediments impacting progress and actions to mitigate: None at this time. The tentative date to begin accepting Em ployer Registrations from our DOL Internet web site is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, August 25, 2010. UI Employer Tax Ledger Replacement This project will replace the current employer ledger with a newer, and easier to use ledger. The current ledger was written several decades ago and is no lo nger able to efficiently handle today’s UI tax business. Currently the ledger is not capable of ac counting for two penalty liabilities. These liabilities must be maintained on a separate Penalty System. Maintenance of employer accounts is largely a manual process that requires extensive training for st aff to become productive in the required tasks. Currently, few adjustments to the ledger are automated. This project would also separate the financial information from that other non-financial informati on that is stored in the same file structure. The scope of this project will include the ability to process remittance adjustments, post returns, payments, and voluntary payments to an Employer Account, create employer payments online, perform daily remittance balancing, and interface with NYS Department of Taxation and Finance late filer information and Failure to file data. It will also include the ability to generate an on-demand co unt of the number of employers that would be considered delinquent at the given point in time that the query is execut ed, produce a daily pre- delinquency count and store the information for revi ew, select employers to receive a pre-delinquency notice (NYS45G) and generate a sample of the data to be printed on the NYS45G. Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 Agile Development Schedule: POC Sprint: June 21, 2010 until Sept 30, 2010: In Progress Status Summary: The team identified the Post Rece ivables to Ledger and the Pay Benefits Use Cases to be modeled and presented to UID customer. The proj ect EPAS resource has exec uted code for the Post Receivable to Ledger. Additional questions were generated and documented for the PA Architect. A spreadsheet was started that will document what methods are calling other components. The team is close to understanding the ledger update proces s. The customer status meeting was held. Accomplishments:  Two transaction types for presentati on to the customer were identified.  Modeling of the Employer and Benefits Us e Cases and transactions continued. UI Systems Improvement Project The purpose of the Unemployment Insurance Systems Improvement (UISIM) Initiative is to design, develop, test and implement a new comprehensive system design for a new Unemployment Insurance System. The base computer software system s that run the nearly $3.5 billi on New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) program today were originally written more than 30 years ago, using languages and file structures that are not easily maintainable or eas ily adaptable to current technologies, such as self- service applications via the Internet. Modification s and enhancements have been made to these systems over the years; however, these existing systems cann ot effectively and efficiently support the demands

--- Page 31 ---
being placed on the Unemployment Insurance Divisi on (UID). The total system to be developed will be tailored to meet or exceed New York State UID needs. The goal is to replace the existing capabilities with a new system(s) that will be able to sup port the UI program into the future. Current Status Report : 08/20/2010 Projects Currently In-Progr ess - see individual project reports for status details. Status: UISIm activities continued for Core Fou ndational, Employer, Benefits and Appeals domains using the PA analysis, design and development assets. We c ontinue to maintain a utility metric spreadsheet on the completeness of the development of use case func tionality for UISIm. We held a customer meeting with UI Divsion directors and st akeholders this week. Our next customer meeting is scheduled for Thursday, September 2nd.

Analyz e this data and design the multi-year BCA (Benefit Charge Adjustment) of the UI Employer Tax rating proc ess. Building on the original UI Tax Rate Project base functionality, extend the single year BCA tax ra ting processes to allow multi-year BCA tax rating processes to be performed.

--- Page 32 ---
The approach that will be used to complete this proj ect begins with the UI Tax Rating Core Project team scoping out bodies of work to be passed off to agile teams. The agile teams consisting of developers and analysts will be formed for the duration required to co mplete each body of work. The bodies of work will be scoped out so that they can be completed in 20 da y time frames. Each body of work (iteration) will consist of a complete deliverable. The first bodies of work to be assigned to the agile teams are: migrate Cúram tax rating system data from the mainframe to the enterprise data model; migrate Rating Workbooks data from the mainframe to the enterpr ise data model; analyze the migrated data for use in supporting multi-year BCA processes; design the multi-year BCA tax rating processes. There will also be a core team of developers and analys ts formed for the duration of the entire project. The core team will be responsible for overseeing and coordinating the work done by each of the agile teams and delivering the final complete product. Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 (Agile Development Project) Project Status: The project will allow users to perfor m prior/multiple year tax rating operations in a production WebSphere Application Server (WAS) environment, and is scheduled to complete in December of 2010. The team met with the product owner this week to update them on the status of the project. Sprint Goals: Convert Total Transfer and Void To tal Transfer transactions from Curam into the new Enterprise database, Develop Determination of Liab ility process, and develop prior year simple Total Transfer and Void Total Transfer of experience process. Sprint Timeline six weeks, Started: N/A, Planned End Date: N/A, Timeline Status: N/A. Sprint Status: The sprint completed on 8/13. Planning is underway for the next sprint. Sprint Accomplishments this Week:  Worked on correcting the Experience Rating subjec t date for employers that are the successor in a Partial Transfer of experience.  Completed the conversion of Curam transaction (about 9,000 records) into the Test environment and worked with the Analysts to validat e the converted transactions.  Completed the loading of 2007 - 2009 Voluntar y Contribution Negative Balance Adjustment transactions into the Development environment.  Worked on analyzing the workbook data from 2007 - 2010 loaded into Oracle Staging tables.  Worked on Developer testing of the Determinations of Liability and Subject Date Change code.  Worked on analyzing how to handle the end/beginni ng of year application locks.  Completed the second round of formal testing t he prior year Total Transfer and prior year Void total transfer processes in the Test environment.  Corrected the defects that were identifie d and deployed the corrected code to the Test environment. Impediments Impacting Progress and Actions to Mitigate: None UI Virtual Call Queuing Callback Manager Project The Unemployment Insurance Division (UID) has moved from a local office model for claims intake, to a self-service model. As such, the primary means of receiving Unemployment Insurance claims is through the Internet and through Interactive Voice Response (IVR). Many claims that are submitted through the IVR are incomplete. Claimants complete their applications by calling the Department of Labor and verbally completing the application with the help of a Telephone Call Center (TCC) Agent. TCC Agents input the remaining claim information into the Unempl oyment Insurance computer system as they speak with the claimants. There are two TCCs in the D epartment of Labor. One is in Glendale, NY and the

--- Page 33 ---
other is in Troy, NY. The two call centers are in a Virtual Call Center (VCC) configuration. There are approximately 250 total TCC Agents. Calls are routed to one of the two centers wh ere the application is completed with the assistance of an Agent. Many requests for information and claim status are also received in the TCCs. The volume of calls received in the Telephone Call Centers varies. Monday sees the highest volume. Mass layoffs and poor economic conditions also creat e a high volume of calls to the TCCs. During those peak volume periods, claimants may wait an excessive amount of time before connecting to an Agent. This causes unnecessary 800 line costs and disgru ntled claimants due to perceived poor customer service. The Unemployment Insurance Division has investigated Virtual Call Queuing Management software to alleviate issues created by variable peaks in TCC call volumes. Virtual Call Queuing Management software is capable of allowing a claimant to disconnect and yet maintain their place in the incoming call queue. When an Agent becomes available, the syst em calls the claimant and makes the connection to the Agent. Software that has been investigated thus far also has the option of allowing claimants to schedule a call back at a date and time t hat is convenient for the claimant. The purpose of this project is to: Develop a set of business and technical requirements needed to determine the hardware, software and associated cost estimates for a Virtual Call Queuing Management system for the Unemployment Insurance Division's Telephone Call Centers. Procure software and hardware necessary for implem enting a Virtual Call Queuing Management system for the Unemployment Insurance Division. Install, configure and test Virtual Call Queuing Management products. Implement the Virtual Call Queuing Management system by training the UI Division administrators and staff, preparing for ongoing Planning and Technology s upport, and transitioning th e products into the production environment. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 A meeting was conducted to disc uss results of the assessment of the call queuing software. Several options were present ed to improve performance. No decision has been made yet on what will be the next step. A design me eting was held to review in more detail the steps involved in the software upgrade part of this proj ect. There are several outstanding items that more information is needed on but so far we have not ident ified any major issues. We have decided that the vendors can have VPN access to the servers for loading the software and doing the configuration and custom coding work. The paper work to enable this to happen is quickly going through the system. Port assignment and network firewall requirements for the va rious servers are being finalized. Next week we will provide the vendor a test of the current system so that they can see how the screen pops and agent workstation currently works. Unix Servers Admin We are proposing to purchase two Power6 595’s. One of the P6 595 will be used for our Production/Staging environment to provide readily avail able hardware resources for our SOA initiative. A third P6 595 will be used for Development/Testing/Di saster Recovery environment. We are also requesting to upgrade our P5 -570’s with additional memory and storage. In addition, the Building 12 server room is in need of improvements to address issues with inadequate cooling capacity, security, replacement of floor t iles and re-cabling. We propose moving the current server room from BD – 4 to BD-15, as this space would require less investment to bring up to date to meet our current needs. The NYS Department of Labor (NYS DOL) relies heavily on the AIX server environment to support the development of J2EE applications that run on WebSphere Application Serv er. With the implementation of a service oriented architecture and the advent of UISIM these systems are at capacity and require

--- Page 34 ---
additional hardware. The current systems will not be able to support expected growth in development and operation of modernized applications and/or services. The B-12 server room in BD-4 is in need of moder nization and the space is very limited in terms of allowing for future growth. Current Status Report: 8/20/20 The CTIP database server has move from P690 to P650. The paperwork to decommission the P690 has been submitted. Installation of monitoring software continues. Videoconferencing Phase 2 To expand on our initial implementation of video confer encing we need to add additional capabilities to facilitate ease of meetings between DOL sta ff in geographically dispersed locations. Current Status Report: 08/20/10 A weekly meeting was held to discuss implementation and locations. We have identified which units should be inclu ded in the next phase of implementation the asset management request is being completed.. VMware View User Mobility 2010 The purpose of this project is to provide a technica l infrastructure to enable Department of Labor (DOL) staff to access and use DOL resources from home or alternate work locations. By providing a virtual desktop computing environment accessible world wide via secure socket layer (SSL) virtual private network (VPN), DOL staff will have portable envi ronments capable of working from any location where Internet network connectivity is available. A us er will be able to access their desktop and files from any location provided they have an Internet connection. All data will reside on Department of Labor owne d storage devices. All vi rtual desktops could be downloaded or accessed by staff using a variety of hardware in a secure environment. This virtual solution is capable of being interfaced with disaster re covery solutions, with minimal effort as compared to other options. Current Status Report: 08/20/2010 All of the project hardwar e and software purchase requests have been created. Requests have got the budget approvals. Team started work on Solution Architecture. Team is waiting for goods to arrive. Voice Web Server Replacement The purpose of this project is to test possibilities for the replacemen t of the Virtual Call Center (VCC) Servers and replace them. The current VCC servers are over 6 years old and in need of replacement. The specific cards that allow the voice communication with the end user are not supported on modern operating systems and need to be replaced. An initial investigation has also identif ied that the Websphere Voice Server (WVS) is at end of life and will no longer be supported by the vendor . A replacement to WVS needs to be identified. Current Status Report: 8/20/2010 The customer meeting was postponed this week due to vacations. The technical team continues establishing the test se rver by transferring the so ftware from the server. Once the server is established we will test the software. It is anticipated that this testing will occur next week.

WIA Financial Management Develop a system that will allow the Local Workforce Investment Areas (LWIAs) to request the drawdown of cash to operate their programs on a month-to-month basis and for the LWIAs to report on their monthly expenditures. The New York State Department of Labor is required by Workforce Investment Act (WIA) regulations to operate a fiscal and management accountability inform ation system as one of the Statewide Workforce Investment Activities. The system must record and report on financial activities involving the Local Workforce Investment Areas (LWIAs). The component of the system that reco rds and monitors the daily LWIA cash drawdown requests has been completed; however, the cash side of the system has not been made available to LWIAs pending completion of t he expenditure side. The Local Area Expenditure Reporting component of the system needs to be co mpleted pending a few modifications to be fully functional for reporting purposes. The expenditure re porting function of the system will allow the thirty- three LWIAs to report their required monthly expenditu res and obligations online. This system will contain standard reporting formats with appropriate edits, checks and balances to produce the cumulative expenditure and obligation information needed to a ccurately complete the required federal financial reports. The expenditure information that is report ed electronically will also be exported to the Financial Accounting and Reporting System (FARS) to be prop erly accounted for in the Department of Labor's official designated accounting system. Current Status Report: This project has been on hold since 7/18/2008 due to resource conflicts. WIA Incentive Grant - Updates to JobZone NYSDOL and NYSED co-authored an application and were awarded a WIA Incentiv e Grant supporting the NYSED Literacy Zone initiative.

xPression Implementation This project is to implement the Document Corr espondence software xPression in our open systems environment. The first program area to use this so ftware is Unemployment Insurance - Employer. It will replace their mainframe based correspondence letter writ ing system. The new system will also interface with the NYS Department of Labor's Electronic Docu ment Management system fo r storing/archiving of document images. Current Status Report: 08/06/10 08/20/10 We are still working on content errors and prioritizing the enhancement requests for the future. We have set up we ekly meetings to review priority and progress. As soon as our users all have Windows 2007, we will turn over the maintenance of content errors to the groups that own the docum ents. Our next effort will be to test and implement the code that allows the user to maintain the user access and document maintenance.
