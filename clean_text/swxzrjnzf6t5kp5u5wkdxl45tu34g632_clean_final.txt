Earthquake in Haiti "The people of Haiti have been permanently impacted by the major earthquake that hit the island this week. Furious rescue efforts are occurring across the country and specialized teams of search and rescue volunteers are being dispatched to the island by the hour. No time can be wasted in getting aid, supplies and rescuers to the people of Haiti as there is a continued effort to search for survivors in the rubble. Any donation or contribution, whether big or small, is imperative to this rescue effort and I would encourage those who are able to assist our fellow man in their time of massive crisis. I want to offer the assistance of my office to my constituents who have any questions or concerns relating to this tragedy and will provide the information necessary to keep concerned constituents informed and able to help." -Congressman Mike Arcuri Haiti Earthquake Resources The thoughts and prayers of the entire Congress are with the people of Haiti.

Haitian Earthquake Relief Fraud Alert The FBI has issued a fraud alert, reminding Internet users who receive appeals to donate money in the aftermath of Tuesday's earthquake in Haiti to apply a critical eye and do their due diligence before responding to those requests. Past tragedies and natural disasters have prompted individuals with criminal intent to solicit contributions purportedly for a charitable organization and/or a good cause. Therefore, before making a donation of any kind, consumers should adhere to certain guidelines, to include the following: - Do not respond to any unsolicited (spam) incoming e-mails, including clicking links contained within those messages. - Be skeptical of individuals representing themselves as surviving victims or officials asking for donations via e-mail or social networking sites. - Verify the legitimacy of nonprofit organizations by utilizing various Internet-based resources that may assist in confirming the group's existence and its nonprofit status rather than following a purported link to the site. - Be cautious of e-mails that claim to show pictures of the disaster areas in attached files because the files may contain viruses. Only open attachments from known senders. - Make contributions directly to known organizations rather than relying on others to make the donation on your behalf to ensure contributions are received and used for intended purposes. - Do not give your personal or financial information to anyone who solicits contributions: Providing such information may compromise your identity and make you vulnerable to identity theft. Anyone who has received an e-mail referencing the above information or anyone who may have been a victim of this or a similar incident should notify the Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov . 3 / 3
