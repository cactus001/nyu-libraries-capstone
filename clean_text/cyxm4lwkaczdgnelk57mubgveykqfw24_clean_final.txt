170 43 CFR Ch. II (10–1–06 Edition) § 2623.1 143), as amended by the Act of August 24, 1912 (37 Stat. 497; 43 U.S.C. 142), and all forms of Executive withdrawal rec-ognized and construed by the Depart-ment of the Interior as reservations, existent prior to January 25, 1927. § 2623.1 Effective date of grant. Grants to the States of school lands in place (the numbered sections), of the character and status subject thereto, as a rule, are effective and operate to vest title upon the date of the approval of the statute making the grant or the date of the admission of the State into the Union, as to lands then surveyed, and as to the lands thereafter surveyed upon the date of the acceptance of the survey thereof by the Director of the Bureau of Land Management. (United States v. Morrison, 240 U.S. 192, 60 L. ed. 599; United States v. Sweet, 245 U.S. 563, 62 L. ed. 473; Wyoming et al. v. United States, supra.) It is held, there-fore, that the grant made by the first paragraph of section 1 of the Act of January 25, 1927, subject to the provi-sion therein with respect to indemnity or lieu lands, to the provisions of sub-sections (b) and (c) of said section 1 and following the plain provisions of sub-section (a) thereof is effective upon the date of the approval of the Act (Janu-ary 25, 1927) as to lands then surveyed and the survey thereof accepted by the Director of the Bureau of Land Man-agement and as to the unsurveyed school sections in the State of Florida granted to that State by the Act of September 22, 1922. The grant, as to other lands thereafter surveyed, sub-ject to the same provisions is effective upon the acceptance of the survey thereof as above indicated. § 2623.2 Claims protected. (a) Valid applications, claims, or rights protected by the provisions of subsection (c) of section 1 of the Act of January 25, 1927, include applications, entries, selections, locations, permits, leases, and other forms of filing, initi-ated or held pursuant to existing laws of the United States prior to January 25, 1927, embracing known mineral school-section lands then surveyed and otherwise within the terms of the addi-tional grant, and as to lands thereafter surveyed, valid applications, claims, or rights so initiated or held prior to the date of the acceptance of the survey. The additional grant to the State will attach upon the effective date of the relinquishment or cancellation of any claim, so asserted, in the absence of any other valid existing claim for the land and if same be then surveyed. Should the validity of any such claim be questioned by the State, proceedings with respect thereto by protest, con-test, hearing, etc., will be had in the form and manner prescribed by exist-ing rules governing such cases. This procedure will be followed in the mat-ter of all protests, contests, or claims filed by individuals, associations, or corporations against the States affect-ing school-section lands. § 2623.3 States not permitted to dis- pose of lands except with reserva-tion of minerals. (a) Subsection (b) of section 1 of the Act of January 25, 1927, provides: That the additional grant made by this Act is upon the express condition that all sales, grants, deeds, or patents for any of the lands so granted shall be subject to and contain a reservation to the State of all the coal and other minerals in the lands so sold, granted, deeded, or patented, together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same. The coal and other mineral deposits in such lands shall be subject to lease by the State as the State legislature may direct, the pro-ceeds of rentals and royalties therefrom to be utilized for the support or in aid of the common or public schools: Provided, That any lands or minerals disposed of contrary to the provisions of this Act shall be forfeited to the United States by appropriate pro-ceedings instituted by the Attorney General for that purpose in the United States district court for the district in which the property or some part thereof is located. (b) The lands granted to the States by the Act of January 25, 1927, and the mineral deposits therein are to be dis-posed of by the States in the manner prescribed in subsection (b) thereof, provision being made for judicial for-feiture in case of disposal of any of the lands or minerals contrary to the pro-visions of the act. § 2623.4 Grant of mineral school sec- tions effective upon restoration of land from reservation.
