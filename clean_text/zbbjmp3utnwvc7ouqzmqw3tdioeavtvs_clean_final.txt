Hoyer Statement on December Jobs Report WASHINGTON, DC - Congressman Steny H. Hoyer (MD) released the following statement today after the Department of Labor announced unemployment numbers for the month of December: &quot;Today's job numbers are a disappointment-for Congress and, more importantly, for the millions of American families who continue to struggle with an unemployment rate of 10%. In 2007, America entered the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, and our recovery is still incomplete. &quot;Nevertheless, it's indisputable that Democratic policies have worked to soften the blow. The Recovery Act has saved or created more than one million jobs, kept six million Americans from falling into poverty, and helped spark economic growth for the first time in two years. Those results, while significant, are clearly not enough-and that is why, last month, the House passed another bill to create jobs for Americans with much-needed infrastructure projects; keep teachers, police, and firefighters on the job; and stimulate our economy by providing assistance to those still out of work. Today's employment report demonstrates the urgency of Congressional action on jobs; I urge the Senate to pass jobs legislation as soon as possible.&quot; ### 1 / 1
