The contractor shall insert i n each of his subcontracts all of the stipulations contained in these Required Provisions and such other stipulations as may be required. A breach of any of the stipulations contained in these Required Provisions may be grounds for termination of the contract. II. NONDISCRIMINATION OF EMPLOYEES AN ACT OF THE KENTUCKY GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT KRS CHAPTER 344 EFFECTIVE JUNE 16, 1972 The contract on this project, in accordance with KRS Chapter 344, provides that during the performance of this contract, the contractor agrees as follows: The contractor shall not fail or refuse to hire, or shall not discharge any individual, or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or age (between forty and seventy); or limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or age (between forty and seventy). The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause. The contractor shall not print or publish or cause to be printed or published a notice or advertisement relating to employment by such an employer or membership in or any classification or referral for employment by the employment agency, indicating any preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination, based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or age (between forty and seventy), except that such notice or advertisement may indicate a preference, limitation, or specification based on religion, or national origin when religion, or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification for employment. If the contractor is in control of apprenticeship or other training or retraining, including on-the-job training programs, he shall not discriminate against an individualbecause of his race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or age (between forty and seventy), in admission to, or employment in any program established to provide apprenticeship or other training.

The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as the administrating agency may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions, including sanctions for non-compliance. III. PAYMENT OF PREDETERMINED MINIMUM WAGES These special provisions are supplemented elsewhere in the contract by special provisions which set forth certain predetermined minimum wage rates. The contractor shall pay not less than those rates. The minimum wage determination schedule shall be posted by the contractor, in a manner prescribed by the Department of Highways, at the site of the work in prominent places where it can be easily seen by the workers. IV. STATEMENTS AND P AYROLLS All contractors and subcontractors affected by the terms of KRS 337.505 to 337.550 shall keep full and accurate payroll records covering all disbursements of wages to their employees to whom they are required to pay not less than the prevailing rate of wages.

Any person or organization aggrieved by the action taken or the findings established as a result of an informal hearing by the Division of Contract Procurement may request a formal hearing. The wages of labor shall be paid in legal tender of the United States, except that this condition will be considered satisfied if payment is made by a negotiable check, on a solvent bank, which may be cashed readily by the employee in the local community for the full amount, without discount or collection charges of any kind. Where checks are used for payments, the contractor shall make all necessary arrangements for them to be cashed and shall give information regarding such arrangements. No fee of any kind shall be asked or accepted by the contractor or any of his agents from any person as a condition of employment on the project. No laborers shall be charged for any tools used in performing their respective duties except for reasonably avoidable loss or damage thereto. Every employee on the work covered by this contract shall be permitted to lodge, board, and trade where and with whom he elects and neither the contractor nor his agents, nor his employees shall directly or indirectly require as a condition of employment that an employee shall lodge, board or trade at a particular place or with a particular person. Every employee on the project covered by this contract shall be an employee of either the prime contractor or an approved subcontractor. No charge shall be made for any transportation furnished by the contractor or his agents to any person employed on the work. No individual shall be employed as a laborer or mechanic on this contract except on a wage basis, but this shall not be construed to prohibit the rental of teams, trucks or other equipment from individuals. No Covered employee may be employed on the work except in accordance with the classification set forth in the schedule mentioned above; provided, however, that in the event additional classifications are required, application shall be made by the contractor to the Department of Highways and (1) the Department shall request appropriate classifications and rates from the proper agency, or (2) if there is urgent need for additional classification to avoid undue delay in the work, the contractor may employ such workmen at rates deemed comparable to rates established for similar classifications provided he has made written application through the Department of Highways, addressed to the proper agency, for the supplemental rates. The contractor shall retroactively adjust, upon receipt of the supplemental rates schedule, the wages of any employee paid less than the established rate and may adjust the wages of any employee overpaid. No contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work which may require or involve the employment of laborers or mechanics shall require or permit any laborer or mechanic in any work-week in which he is employed on such work, to work in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such work- week unless such laborer or mechanic receives compensation at a rate not less than one and one half times his basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such work-week. A laborer, workman or mechanic and an employer may enter into a written agreement or a collective bargaining agreement to work more than eight (8) hours a calendar day but not more than ten (10) hours a calendar day for the straight time hourly rate. This agreement shall be in writing and shall be executed prior to the employee working in excess of eight (8) hours, but not more than ten (10) hours, in any one (1) calendar day. Payments to the contractor may be suspended or withheld due to failure of the contractor to pay any laborer ormechanic employed or working on the site of the work, all or part of the wages required under the terms of the contract. The Department may suspend or withhold payments only after the contractor has been given written notice of the alleged violation and the contractor has failed to comply with the wage determination of the Department of Highways. Contractors and subcontractors shall comply with the sections of Kentucky Revised Statutes, Chapter 337 relating to contracts for Public Works.

EXECUTIVE BRANCH CODE OF ETHICS In the 1992 regular legislative session, the General Assembly passed and Governor Brereton Jones signed Senate Bill 63 (codified as KRS 11A), the Executive Branch Code of Ethics, which states, in part: KRS 11A.040 (6) p rovides: No present or former public servant shall, within six (6) months of following termination of his office or employment, accept employment, compensation or other economic benefit from any person or business that contracts or does business with the state in matters in which he was directly involved during his tenure. This provision shall not prohibit an individual from returning to the same business, firm, occupation, or profession in which he was involved prior to taking office or beginning his term of employment, provided that, for a period of six (6) months, he personally refrains from working on any matter in which he was directly involved in state government. This subsection shall not prohibit the performance of ministerial functions, including, but not limited to, filing tax returns, filing applications for permits or licenses, or filing incorporation papers. KRS 11A.040 (8) states: A former public servant shall not represent a person in a matter before a state agency in which the former public servant was directly involved, for a period of one (1) year after the latter of: a) The date of leaving office or termination of employment; or b) The date the term of office expires to which the public servant was elected. This law is intended to promote public confidence in the integrity of state government and to declare as public policy the idea that state employees should view their work as a public trust and not as a way to obtain private benefits. If you have worked for the executive branch of state government within the past six months, you may be subject to the law's prohibitions. The law's applicability may be different if you hold elected office or are contemplating representation of another before a state agency. Also, if you are affiliated with a firm which does business with the state and which employs former state executive-branch employees, you should be aware that the law may apply to them. In case of doubt, the law permits you to request an advisory opinion from the Executive Branch Ethics Commission, Room 136, Capitol Building, 700 Capitol Avenue, Frankfort, Kentucky 40601; telephone (502) 564-7954.CHRISTIAN COUNTY 024GR12R052-CB06Contract ID: 123225 of 57

The classifications are listed in alphabetical order of "identifiers" that indicate whether the particular rate is union or non -union. Union Identifiers An identifier enclosed in dotted lines beginning with characters other than "SU" denotes that the union classification and rate have found to be prevailing for that classification. Example: PLUM0198 -005 07/01/2011. The first four letters , PLUM, indicate the international union and the four -digit number, 0198, that follows indicates the local union number or district council number where applicable , i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next number, 005 in the example, is an internal number used in processing the wage determination. The date, 07/01/2011, following these characters is the effective date of the most current negotiated rate/collective bargaining agreement which would be July 1, 2011 in the above example. Union prevailing wage rates will be updated to reflect any changes in the collective bargaining agreements governing the rate. Non-Union Identifiers Classifications listed under an "SU" identifier were derived from survey data by computing average rates and are not union rates; however, the data used in computing these rates may include both union and non -union data. Example: SULA2004 -007 5/13/2010. SU indicates the rates are not union rates, LA indicates the State of Louisiana; 2004 is the year of the survey; and 007 is an internal number used in producing the wage determination. A 1993 or later date, 5/13/2010, indicates the classifications and rates under that identifier were issuedPage 12of 14 6/1/2012 http://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/davisbacon/KY127.dvbCHRISTIAN COUNTY 024GR12R052-CB06Contract ID: 123225 of 57

as a General Wage Determination on that date. Survey wage rates will remain in effect and will not change until a new survey is conducted. ---------------------------------------------------------------- WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS ) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can be: * an existing published wage determination * a survey underlying a wage determination * a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on a wage determination matter * a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.) and 3.) should be followed. With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal process described here, initial contact should be with the Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to: Branch of Construction Wage Determinations Wage and Hour Division U.S. Department of Labor 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

Write to: Wage and Hour Administrator U.S. Department of Labor 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. Washington, DC 20210 The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the interested party's position and by any information (wage payment data, project description, area practice material, etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue. ) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).
