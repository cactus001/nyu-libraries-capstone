Oneof their initial purposes was to take students from secondary school, provide them withgeneral education and introductory collegiate studies, and send them on to seniorinstitutions for the baccalaureate.

According to Medsker (1960), two-thirds ofthe students entering community colleges in the 1950s sought transfer. By the 1980s,that proportion had dropped to one-third. Around one-third of the students actuallytransferred in the 1960s. Twenty years later that proportion had dropped to under 15percent.Patterns of student attendance also reveal shifting priorities. The community collegesenroll 37 percent of all students attending higher education in America and, 48 percentof all the undergraduates. However, 65 percent of the community college studentsattend part time (Fernandez, 1987) and many already have college degrees. Somecollege district figures reflect this differentiated pattern of student attendance. Amongthe Maricopa Community College District's 60,000 students, 7,000 were formerlyenrolled in Arizona State University, whereas 8,700 Arizona State University studentswere formerly enrolled in the Maricopa colleges. Furthermore, although 45 percent ofthe high-school graduates in the Phoenix metropolitan area enter one of the localcommunity colleges, they account for only 8 percent of the district's full-time equivalentstudent enrollment (de los Santos, 1989).INFLUENCES ON TRANSFER RATESThere is no question that students enrolling in community colleges are somewhat lesslikely than four-year college students to attain baccalaureate degrees within four or fiveyears. The part-time attendance pattern certainly accounts for some of the differencebetween community college matriculants and those entering as freshmen in four-yearinstitutions. Since few community college students reside on campus or haveon-campus jobs, they tend to be less involved with their collegiate studies than theirfour-year college counterparts.The mere fact that community college matriculants must transfer from one institution toanother before obtaining the baccalaureate accounts for some of the shortfall. Manythings can happen in the process: students take jobs instead; they find that they cannotreadily leave their hometowns to go to the university; it becomes convenient to step outof education for a while and get on with other aspects of their lives.One of the widely held misconceptions about the reasons fewer students who begintheir college careers at community colleges obtain baccalaureate degrees is that the of 6 ED310832 1989-08-00 Commitment to Transfer.

ERIC Resource Center www.eric.ed.gov colleges emphasize occupational studies and courses that do not carry transfer credit.However, more students transfer from so-called career programs than from thetraditional baccalaureate directed programs. Career education does not underminetransfer from community colleges; rather, the transfer function is weakened byinstitutional policies that support the idea of the college as a passive resource availableto all who would drop in at any time during their lifetimes to take a course in whateverinterests them at the time. These policies result in a lateral curriculum, one in whichprerequisites to courses are not enforced and in which student progress towardprogram completion is not monitored.The effects of such policies are revealed not only in the low rate of program completion,but also in the high rate of student satisfaction. Although 85 percent of communitycollege students do not obtain degrees, a similar proportion say that the collegeprovided them with what they were looking for: courses for personal interest, access tothe job market, or studies basic to their becoming functionally literate. While theorganization and funding of community college instructional programs presuppose thatstudents are taking courses in order to complete an entire program, students are quitesatisfied with education short of the degree.EFFORTS TO BOLSTER THE TRANSFERFUNCTIONMany community colleges have attempted to increase their transfer rates by monitoringstudent progress, providing information on transfer opportunities, enforcing courseprerequisites, holding special group meetings for prospective transfers, and similarinterventions. Remedial studies have become so prominent recently that they nowaccount for as much as one-third of the instructional budget, and represent the thirdmajor function of the community colleges, behind only academic and occupationalstudies. The colleges provide basic literacy studies for sizable proportions of theirstudents, including non-native English speakers, as well as those leaving high schoolwithout the ability to read or write. Some of the most innovative instruction is done in theremedial area.Testing students at entry and again at the sophomore level has become prominent andboasts to have an effect on the transfer figures. Colleges in several states are eitherrequired or urged to test students at entry and place them in programs in which theyhave a chance of success. That alone would account for much of the increase inremedial work. Florida has had such a program for several years, and more recently arequirement for basic skills assessment has been introduced into Texas. Rather thanmandating testing states such as California award additional monies to colleges thatimpose matriculation tests and seek to augment their transfer-directed activities.STATEWIDE EFFORTS ED310832 1989-08-00 Commitment to Transfer.

www.eric.ed.gov ERIC Custom Transformations Team These special funds for transfer have become prominent. In 1987, eleven states weremaking special monies available to colleges to enhance transfer-directed activities.California set aside $3 million for transfer centers in 20 colleges. Colorado and Michiganmandated articulation plans between community colleges and public universities. NewJersey awarded special funds to its colleges to recruit transfer-oriented minoritystudents. Ohio awarded funds for colleges that would promote such activities (Centerfor the Study of Community Colleges, 1987). Illinois had numerous special programs toenhance minority student progress through the community colleges. These includedrecruiting and counseling high school students, providing basic skills activities for adults,and connecting the community colleges with elementary schools and intramural supportgroups (Illinois Community College Board, 1989).These types of transfer-directed activities have been summarized in many worksincluding those by Donovan and others (1987) and Richardson and Bender (1987).Most of the interventions are well intentioned and will eventually have some effect.However, some major changes must be made if the community colleges are to comeanywhere near parity in the proportion of their entering students who go on to receivethe baccalaureate. There should be statewide agreements to the effect that any studentwho completes an associate degree program is guaranteed admission to the universitywith no loss of credit. There should be special funds set aside for community collegesthat increase their percentage of transfers. Every state should have a centralizedstudent data base so that interinstitutional progress can be monitored. And there shouldbe common course numbering systems so that each student's transcript does not haveto be reviewed separately.CONCLUSIONProbably the most important single statement that can be made regarding studenttransfer is that the community college staff members must identify the potential transfersearly on and monitor their progress through the colleges, making frequent direct contactwith them until they complete their studies and enter the universities. This takes a formof dedication to student achievement that stands in contradistinction to the prevalentlaissez-faire approach to student attendance. The colleges cannot sit by and allowstudents to take a random walk through the curriculum and at the same time expeditestudent progress toward the baccalaureate.REFERENCESCenter for the Study of Community Colleges.
