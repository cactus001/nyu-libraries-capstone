29440 CFR Ch. I (7±1±99 Edition) § 60.370 where: E=emission rate of particulate matter, kg/ Mg (1b/ton) of stone feed. cs=concentration of particulate matter, g/dscm (g/dscf). Qsd=volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/hr). P=stone feed rate, Mg/hr (ton/hr).K=conversion factor, 1000 g/kg (453.6 g/lb). (2) Method 5 shall be used at nega- tive-pressure fabric filters and other types of control devices and Method 5Dshall be used as positive-pressure fabricfilters to determine the particulatematter concentration (c s) and the volu- metric flow rate (Q sd) of the effluent gas. The sampling time and sample vol-ume for each run shall be at least 60minutes and 0.90 dscm (31.8 dscf). (3) The monitoring device of §60.343(d) shall be used to determinethe stone feed rate (P) for each run. (4) Method 9 and the procedures in §60.11 shall be used to determine opac-ity. (c) During the particulate matter run, the owner or operator shall usethe monitoring devices in §60.343(c)(1)and (2) to determine the average pres-sure loss of the gas stream through thescrubber and the average scrubbing liq-uid supply pressure. [54 FR 6675, Feb. 14, 1989] Subpart KKÐStandards of Per- formance for Lead-Acid Bat-tery Manufacturing Plants SOURCE : 47 FR 16573, Apr. 16, 1982, unless otherwise noted. § 60.370 Applicability and designation of affected facility. (a) The provisions of this subpart are applicable to the affected facilities list-ed in paragraph (b) of this section atany lead-acid battery manufacturingplant that produces or has the designcapacity to produce in one day (24hours) batteries containing an amountof lead equal to or greater than 5.9 Mg(6.5 tons). (b) The provisions of this subpart are applicable to the following affected fa-cilities used in the manufacture oflead-acid storage batteries: (1) Grid casting facility.(2) Paste mixing facility.(3) Three-process operation facility.(4) Lead oxide manufacturing facil- ity. (5) Lead reclamation facility.(6) Other lead-emitting operations.(c) Any facility under paragraph (b) of this section the construction ormodification of which is commencedafter January 14, 1980, is subject to therequirements of this subpart. § 60.371 Definitions. As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaninggiven them in the Act and in subpart Aof this part. (a) Grid casting facility means the fa- cility which includes all lead meltingpots and machines used for casting thegrid used in battery manufacturing. (b) Lead-acid battery manufacturing plant means any plant that produces a storage battery using lead and leadcompounds for the plates and sulfuricacid for the electrolyte. (c) Lead oxide manufacturing facility means a facility that produces leadoxide from lead, including product re-covery. (d) Lead reclamation facility means the facility that remelts lead scrap andcasts it into lead ingots for use in thebattery manufacturing process, andwhich is not a furnace affected undersubpart L of this part. (e) Other lead-emitting operation means any lead-acid battery manufac-turing plant operation from which leademissions are collected and ducted tothe atmosphere and which is not partof a grid casting, lead oxide manufac-turing, lead reclamation, paste mixing,or three-process operation facility, or afurnace affected under subpart L ofthis part. (f) Paste mixing facility means the fa- cility including lead oxide storage,conveying, weighing, metering, andcharging operations; paste blending,handling, and cooling operations; andplate pasting, takeoff, cooling, and dry-ing operations. (g) Three-process operation facility means the facility including thoseprocesses involved with plate stacking,burning or strap casting, and assemblyof elements into the battery case.
