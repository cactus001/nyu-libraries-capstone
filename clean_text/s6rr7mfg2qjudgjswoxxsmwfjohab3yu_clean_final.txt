3UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY REGION 8 IN THE MAT TER OF: ) ) Patrick Goggins ) Vermilion Ranch Co. ) 4419 Vermilion Road ) Billings, MT 59105 ) ) ) ) Respondents. ) )FINDINGS OF VIOLATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE ORD ER FOR COMPLIANCE Docket No. CWA-08-2004-0048 I. STATUTORY AUTHORITY This Findings of Violation and Administrative Order for Compliance (“Order”) is issued pursuant to the authority vested in the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) by section 309 of the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), 33 U.S.C. § 1319. This authority has been properly dele gated to the Assistant Regional Administrator of the Office of Enforcement, Compliance and Environmental Justice, EPA Region 8. The Order is based on the findings of violation of section 301(a) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1311(a), which, among other things, prohibits the discharge of pollutants (e.g., dredged or fill material) into waters of the United States except as in compliance with section 404 of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1344. II. FINDINGS OF V IOLATION Respondent Patric k Goggins is an in dividual residing in or near Billing s, Montana. At all relevant times, Respondent Vermilion Ranch Co. was a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Montana.

--- Page 3 ---
At all relevant times, Respondents owned, controlled and or operated property loca ted near the midpoint of Section 6, Township 2 North, Range 28 East, Yellowstone County, Montana containing a portion of the Yellowstone River (the “Site”). In or around February a nd March 2003 , Respondents discharged or caused to be discharged at the Site, without prior authorization from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”), approximately 500-600 linear feet of f ill material, including but not limited to large concrete slabs and other soil and debris, into the Yellowstone River and on the Yellowstone River’s banks below and above the river’s ordinary hig h water mark (“OHWM”). The Yellowstone River is tributary to the Missouri River. The Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers are, and w ere at all relev ant times, naviga ble, interstate w aters. On April 8, 2003, personnel from the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks inspected the Site and observed the concrete slabs and other soil and debris in and on the bank of approximately 500-600 linear feet of the Yellowstone River. On May 1, 2003, the Corps sent a letter to Respondent Patrick Goggins advising Mr. Goggins that the Corps had become aware of the unauthorized discharges desc ribed in paragraph 4 of Section II of this Order and directing Mr. Gog gins to cease and desist any further unauthorized work or development at the Site. On May 14, 2003, the Corps s ent Mr. Goggin s a follow-up letter requesting that Mr. Goggins advise the Corps that he would take steps to remedy the unauthorized discharge. On June 23, 2003, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality sent a letter to Mr. Goggins advising him that the unauthorized discharges described in paragra ph 4 of Section II of

--- Page 4 ---
5this Order also constituted a violation of the Montana Water Quality Act, Section 75-5-605 and directing Mr. Goggins to take steps to remedy the violation. The activities described in paragraph 4 of Section II of this Order were performed using common earthmoving vehicles and equipment, including a front-end loader owned by Respondents, a dump truck, and a tracked hoe, all of which were operated by Respondents and/or by one or mor e individuals on beh alf of Respondent s. The Yellowstone River bank area that was filled and disturbed by the actions of Respondents described in paragraph 4 of Section II of this Order provided various functions and values, including wildlife habitat f or songbirds, ra ptors, mammals, re ptiles and amphibia ns; water quality enhancement; fl ood storage; an d food chain suppor t. Respondents are each a "person" within the meaning of section 502(5) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1362(5). The discharged fill materials described in paragraph 4 of Section I I of this Order are, and were at all relevant times, “fill material” within the meaning of 33 C.F.R. § 323.2(e) and “pollutants” within the meaning of section 502(6) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1362(6). The vehicles and equipment described in paragraph 9 of Section II of this Order are, and were at all relevant times, each a “point source” within the meaning of section 502(14) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1362(14). The Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers and the banks of the Yellowstone River at or below the OHWM ref erenced in par agraph 5 of Sec tion II of this Order are, a nd were at all relevant times, “waters of the United States” within the meaning of 33 C.F.R. § 328.3(a) and therefore “navigable waters” within the meaning of section 502(7) of the CWA,

--- Page 5 ---
633 U.S.C. § 1362(7). Pursuant to 33 C.F.R. § 328.4(c)(1), the OHWM defines the limits of the Corps’ jurisdiction over non-tidal wa ters in the absenc e of adjacent we tlands. The placement of fill material into and on the banks of the Yellowstone River at or below the OHWM constitutes the “discharge of pollutants” within the meaning of section 502(12) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1362(12). Section 301(a) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1311, prohibits, among other things, the discharge of pollutants by any person into waters of the United States except as in compliance with section 404 of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1344. Section 404 of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, sets forth a permitting system authorizing the Secretary of the Army , acting through the Chief of Engineers of the Corps, to issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters, i.e., w aters of the United States. 33 C.F.R. § 323.3(a) specifies that, unless exempted pursuant to 33 C.F.R. § 323.4, a permit issued by the Corps is required for the discharge of dre dged or fill material into waters of the United State s. Respondents are n ot and never have been authorized b y a permit iss ued pursuant to section 404 of the C WA, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, to conduct any of the activities d escribed in paragraph 4 of Section II of this Orde r. Respondents’ activities described in paragraph 4 of Section II of this Order violate section 301 of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1311. Each discharge of pollutants from a point source by Respondents into wa ters of the United States without the r equired permits is sued pursuant to section 404 of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, constitutes a violation of section 301(a) of the CWA,

--- Page 6 ---
733 U.S.C. § 1311(a) . Each day t he discharges remain in place w ithout the require d permits constitutes an additional day of violation of section 301(a). The removal of the fill material illegally discharged into wate rs of the United States at the Site and restorat ion of the impacte d waters to a cond ition that closely approximates their condition and function prior to the discharge of the fill material, can be achieved as a prac tical matter through c ommonly used m ethods of construc tion, digging, filling, reveg etation, and best management pra ctices. Activities to be carried out under this Order are remedial, not punitive, and are necessary to achieve the CWA’s objective “to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biolog ical integrity of the Nation’s waters,” as specified in section 101(a) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a) . The removal and restoration desc ribed in parag raph 21 of Section II of this Order are appropriate to alleviate actual and potential harm to water quality , aquatic habitat, and wildlife habitat c aused by Res pondents’ unperm itted activities. This Order was issued after consultation and coordination with the Corps’ Omaha District, Helena Regulatory Office. III. ORDER Based upon the foregoing FINDI NGS OF VIOLATIO N, and pursuant to the authority vested in the Administrator of the EPA pursuant to sections 308 and 309(a) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1318 and 1319(a), as properly delegated to the Assistant Regional Administrator of the Office of Enforcement, Compliance and Environmental Justice, EPA Region 8, it is hereby ORDERED:
