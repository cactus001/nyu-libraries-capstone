3 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Overview Background on the U.S.- Swiss Safe Harbor The Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) went into effect in July 1993, and important modifi cations in January 2008. The FADP would prohibit the transfer of personal data to countries that do not meet Switzerland’s “adequacy” standard for privacy protection. While the United States and Switzerland share the goal of enhancing pr ivacy protection for their citizens, the United States takes a different approach to privacy from that taken by Switzerland. The United States uses a sectoral approach that relies on a mix of legislation, regulation, and self -regulation. Switzerland, howev er, relies on comprehensive legislation that requires, among other things, the creation of an independent government data protection agency, registration of databases with this agency, and in some instances prior approval before personal data processing ma y begin. As a r esult of these differences, the comprehensive procedures set forth in Swiss law could have impacted the ability of U.S. organizations to enga ge in a range of transactions with Switzerland . In order to bridge these differences and provide a s treamlined and cost -effective means for U. S. organizations to satisfy the Act ’s “adequacy” requirement , the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the Federal Data Protecti on and Information Commissioner of Switzerland developed a "Safe Harbor " framework. This arrangement was developed in accordance with the U.S.- Swiss Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum that had been established in 2006. The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, which was approved by Switzerland in 2009, is an important way for U. S. organizations to avoid experiencing interruptions in their business dealings with Switzerland or facing prosecution by Swiss authorities under Swiss privacy law. Self -certifying to the U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Framework will ensure that Swiss organizations know that your organization provides "adequate" privacy protection, as defined by Swiss law. U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Benefits The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor program provides a number of important benefits to U.S. and Swiss organizations.

4 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Benefits for participating U.S. organizations include: • Participating organizations will be deemed to provide “ adequate” privacy protection; • Swiss requirements for prior approval of data transfers either will be waived or approval will be automatically granted; and • Claims brought by Swiss citizens against U.S. organizations will be heard, subject to limited exceptions, in the U. S.; and • Compliance requirements are streamlined and cost -effective, which should particularly benefit small and medium enterprises. A Swiss org anization can ensure that it is sending information to a U.S. organization participating in the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor program by viewing the public list of Safe Harbor organizations posted on the Safe Harbor website. This list contains the names of all U. S. organizations that have self -certified to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework. This list will be regularly updated, so that it is clear which organizations are assured of Safe Harbor benefits. How does an organization join? The decision by U.S. organi zations to enter the U.S.- Swiss Safe Harbor program is entirely voluntary. Organizations that decide to participate in the U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor program must comply with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and publicly declare that they do so. To be assured of Safe Harbor benefits, an organization must self-certify annually in writing to the Department of Commerce that it agrees to adhere to the U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor program requirements, which include elements such as notice, choice, access, and enforcement. It must also state in its published privacy policy statement that it complies with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and that it has certified its adherence to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles . The Department of Commerce maintain s a list of the organizations that file self-certification letters and make s both the list and the self -certification letters publicly available. To qualify for the U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor , an organization can either join a self -regulatory privacy program that adheres to the Safe Harbor ’s requirements or develop its own self -regulatory privacy policy that conforms to the Safe Harbor .

5 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Moreover, only those organizations subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or U.S. air carriers and ticket agents subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation (DoT) may p articipate in the Safe Harbor . Organizations generally not subject to FTC jurisdiction include c ertain financial institutions (e.g. banks, investment houses, credit unions, and savings & loan institutions), telecommunication common carriers, labor associations, non- profit organizations, agricultural co- operatives, a nd meat processing facilities. In addition, the FTC’s jurisdiction with regard to insurance activities is lim ited t o certain circumstances. If you are uncertain as to whether your organization falls under the jurisdiction of either the FTC or DoT, as certain exceptions to general ineligibility do exist, be sure to contact those agencies for more information. What do the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles require? Organizations must comply with the seven Safe Harbor Privacy Pr inciples , which require the following: Notice Organizations must notify individuals about the purposes for which they collect and use information about them. They must provide information about how individuals can contact the organization with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which they disclose the information and the choices and means the organization offers for limiting i ts use and disclosure. Choice Organizations must give individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their personal information will be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally c ollected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For sensitive information, affirmative or explicit (opt in) choice must be given if the information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the individual.

6 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Onward Transfer (Transfers to Third Parties) To disclose information to a third party, organizations must apply the notice and choice principles. Where an organization wishes to transfer informati on to a third party that is acting as an agent, it may do so if it makes sure that the third party subscribes to the Safe Harbor Privacy Pr inciples or is subject to the FADP or another adequacy finding. As an alternative, the organization can enter into a written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant principles. Access Individuals must have access to personal information about themselves that an organization holds and be able to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Security Organizations must take reasonable precautions to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Data integr ity Personal information must be relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. An organization should take reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. Enforcement In order to ensure com pliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Pr inciples, there must be (a) readily available and affordable independent recourse mechanisms so that each individual’s complaints and disputes can be investigated and resolved and damages awarded where the applicable law or private sector initiatives so provide; (b) procedures for verifying that the commitments organizations make to adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Pr inciples have been implemented; and (c) obligations to remedy problems arising out of a failure to com ply with the Safe Harbor Privacy Pr inciples .

7 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Sanctions must be sufficiently rigorous to ensure compliance by the organization. Organizations that fail to provide annual self -certification letters reaffirming their commitment to the U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and/or the U.S. -EU Safe Harbor Framework will no longer be assured of the relevant Safe Harbor benefits and may ultimately be removed from the list of participants maintained on the Safe Harbor website . The Department of Commerce has iss ued a set of frequently asked questions and answers (FAQs) that clarify and supplement the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.

8 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Helpful Hints on Self -Certifying Compliance This section contains helpful hints on self -certifying compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and serve s as a checklist that should be reviewed to evaluate an organization’s readiness to self-certify. Although this section provides succinct answers to many common questions regarding the self-certification process , this resource should be used in conjunction with the rest of the Guide, including the requirements for self -certification detailed in FAQ 6. The topics covered below include: determining whether your organization is subject to the jurisdiction of an appropriate statutory authority, developing a Safe Harbor compliant privacy policy statement, establishing a suitable independent recourse mechanism , ensuring that a suitable verification method is in place, and designating a contact within your organization reg arding Safe Harbor . Confirm that Your Organization is Subject to the Jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Transportation : Any U.S. organization that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC ) or U.S. air carriers and ticket agents subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation (DoT) may participate in the Safe Harbor . The FTC and DoT have both stated in letters to the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) (located with the Framework documents under Letters G and H) that they will take enforcement action against organizations that state that they are in compliance with the Framework, but then fail to live up to their statements. If you are uncertain as to whether your organization falls under the jurisdiction of either the FTC or DoT, then please be sure to contact those agencies for more information. Develop a Safe Harbor Compliant Privacy Policy Statement: Remember to develop a Safe Harbor complia nt privacy policy before submitting a self -certification form to the Department of Commerce. • Make Sure that Your Privacy Policy Conforms to the U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles: In order for a privacy policy to be compliant with the Framework, the privacy policy must conform to the seven Safe Harbor Privacy Principles , as well as any relevant points covered in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), which are located with the other Framework documents . In addition, the privacy policy should reflect your organization’s actual and anticipated information handling practices. It is also important to write a policy that is clear, concise, and easy to understand.

9 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce • Make Specific Reference in the Text of Your Privacy Policy to Your Organization's Saf e Harbor Compliance: FAQ 6 requires each organization that self -certifies to state in its applicable published privacy policy that it complies with the U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and that it has certified its adherence to the Safe Harbor Privacy Prin ciples . In addition, each organization should include either a hyperlink to the Safe Harbor website or the corresponding URL (e.g., http://export.gov/safeharbor). • Provide an Accurate Privacy Policy Location and Make Sure that Your Privacy Policy is Availab le to the Public: At the time of self -certification, each organization must provide an accurate location for its applicable privacy policy. In addition, each organization should verify that its privacy policy is effective prior to self -certification. If your organization decides to post your privacy policy on an Internet or Intranet site, it must provide an accurate URL. o If your organization: 1) has a public website on which it has posted a general privacy policy statement or made any other representation r egarding its privacy practices; and 2) has chosen to cover personal data (e.g., client or customer data) other than your organization’s own human resources data under its self -certification, then the posted privacy -related language must include an affirmat ive statement that your organi zation complies with the U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and has certified its adherence to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (i.e., it is not sufficient to simply upload a privacy policy to your organization’s Safe Harbor s ubmission). In addition, the posted privacy - related language must also include either a hyperlink to the Safe Harbor website or the corresponding URL (e.g., http://export.gov/safeharbor/ ). o If the information covered by your organization’s self -certification exclusively relates to your own organization’s human resources data, then the privacy policy covering such data need only be made available to your organization’s employees and as part of the Safe Harbor review process (i.e., your organization is not required to upload a copy to your organization’s Safe Harbor submission, but it is encouraged do so). If such a policy is listed as being located at corporate headquarters or on the corporate Intranet or is otherwise inaccessible to the general public via yo ur organization’s public website, then your organization must provide the Department of Commerce with a copy of the policy so that it can be reviewed. If a copy of such a policy is provided for the reason just described, your organization must clarify whet her or not it would object to having the copy uploaded to your organization’s Safe Harbor submission.

10 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Establish Your Organization's Independent Recourse Mechanism : Under the Framework’s Enforcement Principle, organizations self -certifying must establ ish an independent recourse mechanism available to investigate unresolved complaints. (See FAQ 11 for more information regarding dispute resolution under Safe Harbor ). The organization must ensure that its recourse mechanism is in place prior to self -certification. In addition, each organization should include in its privacy policy an appropriate reference to the independent recourse mechanism(s), as well as relevant contact information for said mechanism(s). In most cases, organizations self -certifying to Safe Harbor may choose to utilize private sector dispute resolution programs. While programs vary, organizations like t he Council of Better Business Bureaus (BBB) , TRUSTe , Direct Marketing Association (DMA) , the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) , the American Arbitration Association (AAA) , and JAMS have developed programs that assist in compliance with the Framework's Enforcement Principle and FAQ 11 . Alternatively, organizations may choose to cooperate and comply with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC). In doing so, an organization must follow the procedures outlined in FAQ 5 . If organization human resources data (i.e. personal information about your organization's own employees, past or present, collected in t he context of the employment relationship) is being covered in your organization's self -certification, your organizat ion must comply with the FADP with respect to such data. Additional guidance on the handling of human resources data under the Framework is provided in FAQ 9 . Ensure that Your Organization's Verification Mechanism is in Place : As discussed in FAQ 7 , organizations self -certifying to the Framework are required to have procedures in place for verifying compliance. To meet this requirement, an organization may use either a self -assessment or a third -party assessment program. For additional guidance on the Framework's verification requirement, please see FAQ 7 . Designate a Contact within Your Organization Regarding Safe Harbor : Each organization i s required to provide a contact for the handling of questions, complaints, access requests, and any other issues arising under the Safe Harbor . This contact can be either the corporate officer that is certifying your organization's compliance with the Fram ework, or another official within your organization, such as a Chief Privacy Officer.

11 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Safe Harbor Privacy Principles U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles Issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce on February 16, 2009 The privacy legislation of Switzerland (Federal Act on Data Pr otection, FADP) was adopted by the Swiss Parliament on June 19, 1992.1 It requires that transfers of personal data take place only to third countries that provide an “adequate” level of privacy protection (Art. 6 FADP). W hile the United States and Switzerland share the goal of enhancing privacy protection for their citizens, the United States takes a different approach to privacy from that taken by Switzerland. The United States uses a sectoral approach that relies on a mi x of legislation, regulation, and self regulation. Given those differences, many U.S. organizations have expressed uncertainty about the impact of the required “adequacy standard” on personal data transfers from Switzerland to the United States. To diminis h this uncertainty and provide a more predictable framework for such data transfers, the Department of Commerce is issuing this document and Frequently Asked Questions (“the Principles”) under its statutory authority to foster, promote, and develop international commerce. As the Swiss and EU legislation on data protection may be considered equivalent, the U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Principles and FAQs are modeled on the Principles and FAQs developed for the U.S. -EU Safe Harbor . They are intended for use by U.S. organizations receiving personal data from Switzerland for the purpose of qualifying for the Safe Harbor and the presumption of “adequacy” it creates. Because the Principles were solely designed to serve this specific purpose, their adoption for other pur poses may be inappropriate. Decisions by organizations to qualify for the Safe Harbor are entirely voluntary, and organizations may qualify for the Safe Harbor in different ways. Organizations that decide to adhere to the Principles must comply with the P rinciples in order to obtain and retain the benefits of the Safe Harbor and publicly declare that they do so. For example, if an organization joins a self -regulatory privacy program that adheres to the Principles, it qualifies for the Safe Harbor . Organizations may also qualify by developing their own self -regulatory privacy policies provided that they conform with the Principles. 1 The FADP entered into force on 7/1/1993

--- Page 14 ---
12 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Where in complying with the Principles, an organization relies in whole or in part on self -regulation, its failure to c omply with such self -regulation must also be actionable under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts or another law or regulation prohibiting such acts. (See the annex for the list of U.S. statutory bodies recognized by Switzerland.) In addition, organizations subject to a statutory, regulatory, administrative or other body of law (or of rules) that effectively protects personal privacy may also qualify for Safe Harbor benefits. In all instances, Safe Harbor benefits are assured from the date on which each organization wishing to qualify for the Safe Harbor self-certifies to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) its adherence to the Principles in accordance with the guidance set forth in the Frequently Asked Question on Self -Certification. Adherence to these Principles may be limited: (a) to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements; (b) by statute, government regulation, or case law that creates conflic ting obligations or explicit authorizations, provided that, in exercising any such authorization, an organization can demonstrate that its non- compliance with the Principles is limited to the extent necessary to meet the overriding legitimate interests fur thered by such authorization; or (c) if the effect of Swiss or cantonal data protection measures is to allow exceptions or derogations, provided they are applied in comparable contexts. Consistent with the goal of enhancing privacy protection, organizations should strive to implement these Principles fully and transparently, including indicating in their privacy policies where exceptions to the Principles permitted by (b) above will apply on a regular basis. For the same reason, where the option is allowabl e under the Principles and/or U.S. law, organizations are expected to opt for the higher protection where possible. Organizations may wish for practical or other reasons to apply the Principles to all their data processing operations, but they are only obl igated to apply them to data transferred after they enter the Safe Harbor . To qualify for the Safe Harbor , organizations are not obligated to apply these Principles to personal information in manually processed filing systems. Organizations wishing to benefit from the Safe Harbor for receiving information in manually processed filing systems from Switzerland must apply the Principles to any such information transferred after they enter the Safe Harbor . An organization that wishes to extend Safe Harbor benef its to human resources personal information transferred from Switzerland for use in the context of an employment relationship must indicate this when it self -certifies to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) and conform to the requirements set fort h in the Frequently Asked Question on Self -Certification.

13 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Organizations will also be able to provide the safeguards necessary under Article 6(2) FADP if they include the Principles in written agreements with parties transferring data from Switzerl and for the substantive privacy provisions, once the other provisions for such model contracts are authorized by the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (hereafter “the Commissioner”). U.S. law will apply to questions of interpretation and compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles (including the Frequently Asked Questions) and relevant privacy policies by Safe Harbor organizations, except where organizations have committed to cooperate with the Commissioner. Unless otherwise stated, all pr ovisions of the Safe Harbor Principles and Frequently Asked Questions apply where they are relevant. “Personal data” and “personal information” are data about an identified or identifiable individual that are within the scope of the FADP, received by a U.S . organization from Switzerland, and recorded in any form. Notice: An organization must inform individuals about the purposes for which it collects and uses information about them, how to contact the organization with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which it discloses the information, and the choices and means the organization offers individuals for limiting its use and disclosure. This notice must be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to the organization or as soon thereafter as is practicable, but in any event before the organization uses such information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected or processed by the transferring organization or discloses it for the first time to a third party. In observing the Notice Principle, organizations should take note of Article 4(3) FADP, which provides, “Personal data may only be processed for the purpose indicated at the time of collection, that is evident from the circumstances, or that is provided by law.” It is not necessary to provide notice when disclosure is made to a third party that is acting as an agent to perform task(s) on behalf of and under the instructions of the organization ( Art. 10a FADP). The Onward Transfer Principle, on the other hand, does apply to such disclosures. Choice: An organization must offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their personal information is (a) t o be disclosed to a third party or (b) to be used for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

14 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Individuals must be provided with clear and conspicuous, readily available, and affordable mechanisms to exercise choice. For sensitive information (i.e., personal information specifying medical or health conditions, personal sexuality, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, ideological or trade union- related views or activities , or information on social security measures or administrative or criminal proceedings and sanctions, which are treated outside pending proceedings), they must be given affirmative or explicit (opt in) choice if the information is to be disclosed to a thir d party or used for a purpose other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual through the exercise of opt in choice (Art. 4(5) FADP). In any case, an organization should treat as sensitive any information received from a third party where the third party identifies and treats it as sensitive. In observing the Choice Principle, organizations should take note of Article 4(3) FADP, which provides, “Personal data may only be processed for the purpose indicated at the time of collection, that is evident from the circumstances, or that is provided by law.” It is not necessary to provide choice when disclosure is made to a third party that is acting as an agent to perform task(s) on behalf of and under the instruc tions of the organization (Art. 10a FADP). The Onward Transfer Principle, on the other hand, does apply to such disclosures. Onward Transfer: To disclose information to a third party, organizations must apply the Notice and Choice Principles. Where an orga nization wishes to transfer information to a third party that is acting as an agent, as described in the footnotes, it may do so if it first either ascertains that the third party subscribes to the Principles or is subject to the FADP or another adequacy f inding or enters into a written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Principles. If the organization complies with these requirements, it shall n ot be held responsible (unless the organization agrees otherwise) when a third party to which it transfers such information processes it in a way contrary to any restrictions or representations, unless the organization knew or should have known the third party would process it in such a contrary way and the organization has not taken reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing.

15 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Security: Organizations creating, maintaining, using or disseminating personal information must take reasonable pr ecautions to protect it from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Data Integrity: Consistent with the Principles, personal information must be relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. An organization ma y not process personal information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, an organization should take reasonable steps to ens ure that data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. Access: Individuals must have access to personal information about them that an organization holds and be able to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Enforcement: Effective priv acy protection must include mechanisms for assuring compliance with the Principles, recourse for individuals to whom the data relate affected by non- compliance with the Principles, and consequences for the organization when the Principles are not followed. At a minimum, such mechanisms must include: a) readily available and affordable independent recourse mechanisms by which each individual’s complaints and disputes are investigated and resolved by reference to the Principles and damages awarded where the appl icable law or private sector initiatives so provide; b) follow up procedures for verifying that the attestations and assertions businesses make about their privacy practices are true and that privacy practices have been implemented as presented; and c) obligat ions to remedy problems arising out of failure to comply with the Principles by organizations announcing their adherence to them and consequences for such organizations. Sanctions must be sufficiently rigorous to ensure compliance by organizations.

18 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce I. Sensitive Data Q: Must an organization always provide explicit (opt in) choice with respect to sensitive data? A: No, such choice is not required where the processing is: (1) in the vital interests of the data subject or another person; (2) nec essary for the establishment of legal claims or defenses; (3) required to provide medical care or diagnosis; (4) carried out in the course of legitimate activities by a foundation, association or any other non- profit body with a political, philosophical, r eligious or trade- union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members of the body or to the persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the data are not disclosed to a third party without the consent of the data subjects; (5) necessary to carry out the organization’s obligations in the field of employment law; or (6) related to data that are manifestly made public by the individual. II. Journalistic Exceptions Q: Given U.S. constitutional protections for freedom of the press and the FADP’s exemption for journalistic material, do the Safe Harbor Principles apply to personal i nformation gathered, maintained or disseminated for journalistic purposes? A: Where the rights of a free press embodied in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution intersect with privacy protection interests, the First Amendment must govern the balancing of these interests with regard to the activities of U.S. persons or organizations. Personal information that is gathered for publication, broadcast, or other forms of public communication of journalistic material, whether used or not, as well as information found in previously published material disseminated from media archives, is not subject to the requirements of the Safe Harbor Principles. III. Secondary Liability Q: Are Internet service providers (ISP s), telecommunications carriers or other organizations liable under the Safe Harbor Principles when on behalf of another organization they merely transmit, route, switch or cache information that may violate their terms? A: No, as is the case with the FADP itself, the Safe Harbor does not create secondary liability.

--- Page 21 ---
19 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce To the extent that an organization is acting as a mere conduit for data transmitted by third parties and does not determine the purposes and means of processing those personal data, it would not be liable. IV. Investment Banking and A udits Q: The activities of auditors and investment bankers may involve processing personal data without the consent or know ledge of the individual. Under what circumstances is this permitted by the Notice, Choice, and Access Principles? A: Investment bankers or auditors may process information without knowledge of the individual only to the extent and for the period necessary to meet statutory or public interest requirements and in other circumstances in which the application of these Principles would prejudice the legitimate interests of the organization. These legitimate interests include the monitoring of companies’ compliance with their legal obligations and legitimate accounting activities, and the need for confidentiality connected with possible acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, or other similar transactions carried out by investment bankers or auditors. V. The Role of the Commissioner Q: How will companies that commit to cooperate with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland (the Commissioner) make those commitments and how will they be implemented? A: Under the Safe Harbor , U.S. organ izations receiving personal data from Switzerland must commit to employ effective mechanisms for assuring compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles. They must provide, as specified in the Enforcem ent Principle : (a) recourse for indiv iduals to whom the dat a relate; (b) follow -up procedures for verifying that the attestations and assertions they have made about t heir privacy practices are true; and (c) obligations to remedy problems arising out of failure to comply with the Principles and consequences for such organizations. An organization may satisfy points (a) and (c) of the Enforcement Principle if it adheres to the requirements of this FAQ for cooperating with the Commissioner. An organization may commit to cooperate with the Co mmissioner by declaring in its Safe Harbor certification to the Department of Commerce ( see FAQ 6: Self -Certification) that the organization:

--- Page 22 ---
20 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce • Elects to satisfy the requirement in points (a) and (c) of the Safe Harbor Enforcement Principle by committing to cooperate with the Commissioner; • Will cooperate with the Commissioner in the investigation and resolution of complaints brought under the Safe Harbor ; and • Will comply with any advice given by the Commissioner where the Commissioner takes the view that the organization needs to take specific action to comply with the Safe Harbor Principles, including remedial or compensatory measures for the benefit of individuals affected by any non- compliance with the Principles, and will provide the Commissioner with written confirmation that such action has been taken. The cooperation of the Commissioner will be provided in the form of information and advice in the following way: • The advice of the Commissioner can be delivered directly. • The Commissioner will provide advice to the U.S. organi zations concerned on unresolved complaints from individuals about the handling of personal information that has been transferred under the Safe Harbor . This advice will be designed to ensure that the Safe Harbor Principles are being correctly applied and w ill include any remedies for the individual(s) concerned that the Commissioner considers appropriate. • The Commissioner will provide such advice in response to referrals from the organizations concerned and/or to complaints received directly from individuals against organizations which have committed to cooperate with the Commissioner for Safe Harbor purposes, while encouraging and if necessary helping such individuals in the first instance to use the in- house complaint handling arrangements that the organi zation may offer. • Advice will be issued onl y after both sides have had a reasonable opportunity to comment and to provide any evidence they wish. The Commissioner will seek to deliver advice as quickly as this requirement for due process allows. • The Commi ssioner will make public the results of its consideration of complaints submitted to it, if it sees fit. • The delivery of advice through the Commissioner will not give rise to any liability for the Commissioner.

--- Page 23 ---
21 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce As noted above, organizations choosing thi s option must undertake to comply with the advice of the Commissioner. If an organization fails to comply with this advice and has offered no satisfactory explanation for its noncompliance, the Commissioner will give notice of its intention either to su bmit the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or other U.S. federal or state body with statutory powers to take enforcement action in cases of deception or misrepresentation, or to conclude that the agreement to cooperate has been seriously breached and must therefore be considered null and void. In the latter case, the Commissioner will inform the Department of Commerce (or its designee) so that the list of Safe Harbor participants can be duly amended. Any failure to fulfill the undertaking to cooperate with the Commissioner, as well as failures to comply with the Safe Harbor Principles, will be actionable as a deceptive practice under Section 5 of the FTC Act or other similar statute. VI. Self -Certification Q: How does an organization self -certify that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles? A: Safe Harbor benefits are assured from the date on which an organization self -certifies to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) its adherence to the Principles in accordance with the guidance set forth be low. To self -certify for the Safe Harbor , organizations can provide to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) a letter – signed by a corporate officer on behalf of the organization t hat is joining the Safe Harbor – that contains at least the followin g information: • Name of the organization, mailing address, e- mail address , telephone and fax numbers; • Description of the activities of the organization with respect to personal information received from Switzerland; and • Description of the organization’s pri vacy policy for such personal information, including:

--- Page 24 ---
22 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce o where the privacy policy is available for viewing by the public, o its effective date of implementation, o a contact office for the handling of complaints, access requests, and any other issues arising under the Safe Harbor , o the specific statutory body that has jurisdiction to hear any claims against the organization regarding possible unfair or deceptive practices and violations of laws or regulations governing privacy (and that is listed in t he annex to the Principles), o the name of any privacy programs in which the organization is a member, o the method of verification ( e.g., in-house, third party) (see FAQ 7: Verification), and o the independent recourse mechanism that is available to investigate unresolved complaints. Where the organization wishes its Safe Harbor benefits to cover human resources information transferred from Switzerland for use in the context of the employment relationship, it may do so where there is a statutory body with jur isdiction to hear claims against the organization arising out of human resources information that is listed in the annex to the Principles. In addition, the organization must indicate this in its letter and declare its commitment to cooperate with the Comm issioner or authorities concerned in conformity with FAQ 9: Human Resources and FAQ 5: the Role of the Commissioner as applicable and that it will comply with the advice given by such authorities. The Department (or its designee) will maintain a list of al l organizations that file such letters, thereby assuring the availability of Safe Harbor benefits, and will update such list on the basis of annual letters and notifi cations received pursuant to FAQ 11: Dispute Resoluti on and Enforcement . Such self - certification letters should be provided not less than annually. Otherwise the organization will be removed from the list and Safe Harbor benefits will no longer be assured. Both the list and the self -certification letters submitted by the organizations will be m ade publicly available. All organizations that self -certify for the Safe Harbor must also state in their relevant published privacy policy statements that they adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles.

--- Page 25 ---
23 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce The undertaking to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles is not time- limited in respect of data received during the period in which the organization enjoys the benefits of the Safe Harbor . Its undertaking means that it will continue to apply the Principles to such data for as long as the organization stores , uses or discloses them, even if it subsequently leaves the Safe Harbor for any reason. An organization that will cease to exist as a separate legal entity as a result of a merger or a takeover must notify the Department of Commerce (or its designee) of t his in advance. The notification should also indicate whether the acquiring entity or the entity resulting from the merger will: (1) continue to be bound by the Safe Harbor Principles by the operation of law governing the takeover or merger or (2) elect to self- certify its adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles or put in place other safeguards, such as a written agreement that will ensure adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles. W here neither (1) nor (2) apply , any data that has been acquired under the Saf e Harbor must be promptly deleted. An organization does not need to subject all personal information to the Safe Harbor Principles, but it must subject to the Safe Harbor Principles all personal data received from Switzerland after it joins the Safe Harbor . Any misrepresentation to the general public concerning an organization’s adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles may be actionable by the Federal Trade Commission or other relevant government body. Misrepresentations to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) may be actionable under the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. § 1001). VII. Verification Q: How do organizations provide follow up procedures for verifying that the attestations and assertions they make about their Safe Harbor privacy practices are true and those privacy practices have been implemented as represented and in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles? A: To meet the verification requirements of the Enforcement Principle, an organization may verify such attestations and assertions either through self -assessment or outside compliance reviews.

--- Page 26 ---
24 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Under the self -assessment approach, such verification would have to indicate that an organization’s published privacy policy regarding personal information received from Switzerland is accurate, comprehensive, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible. It would also need to indicate that its privacy policy conforms to the Safe Harbor Principles; that individuals are informed of any in-house arrangements for handling com plaints and of the independent mechanisms through which they may pursue complaints; that it has in place procedures for training employees in its implementation, and disciplining them for failure to follow it; and that it has in place internal procedures f or periodically conducting objective reviews of compliance with the above. A statement verifying the self -assessment should be signed by a corporate officer or other authorized representative of the organization at least once a year and made available upon request by individuals or in the context of an investigation or a complaint about non- compliance. Organizations should retain their records on the implementation of their Safe Harbor privacy practices and make them available upon request in the context of an investigation or a complaint about non- compliance to the independent body responsible for investigating complaints or to the agency with unfair and deceptive practices jurisdiction. Where the organization has chosen outside compliance review, such a re view needs to demonstrate that its privacy policy regarding personal information received from Switzerland conforms to t he Safe Harbor Principles, it is being complied with , and individuals are informed of the mechanisms through which they may pursue compl aints. The methods of review may include without limitation , auditing, random reviews, use of “decoys”, or use of technology tools as appropriate. A statement verifying that an outside compliance review has been successfully completed should be signed either by the reviewer or by the corporate officer or other authorized representative of the organization at least once a year and made available upon request by individuals or in the context of an investigation or a complaint about compliance. VIII. Access Access Principle: Individuals must have access to personal information about them that an organization holds and be able to correct, amend or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be dis proportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the legitimate rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.

--- Page 27 ---
25 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Q1: Is the right of access absolute? A1: No, u nder the Safe Harbor Principles, the right of access is fundamental to privacy protection. In particular, it allows individuals to verify the accuracy of information held about them. Nonetheless, the obligation of an organization to provide access to the personal information it holds about an individual is subject to the principle of proportionality or reasonableness and has to be tempered in certain instances. Indeed, the Explanatory Memorandum to the 1980 OECD Privacy Guidelines makes clear that an organization’s access obligation is not abs olute. It does not require the exceedingly thorough search mandated, for example, by a subpoena, nor does it require access to all the different forms in which the information may be maintained by the organization. Rather, experience has shown that in responding to individuals’ access requests, organizations should first be guided by the concern(s) that led to the requests in the first place. For example, if an access request is vague or broad in scope, an organization may engage the individual in a dialogu e so as to better understand the motivation for the request and to locate responsive information. The organization might inquire about which part(s) of the organization the individual interacted with and/or about the nature of the information (or its use) that is the subject of the access request. Individuals do not, however, have to justify requests for access to their own data. Expense and burden are important factors and should be taken into account but they are not controlling in determining whether providing access is reasonable. For example, if the information is used for decisions that will significantly affect the individual ( e.g., the denial or grant of important benefits, such as insurance, a mortgage, or a job), then consistent with the other prov isions of these FAQs, the organization would have to disclose that information even if it is relatively difficult or expensive to provide. If the information requested is not sensitive or not used for decisions that will significantly affect the individual (e.g., non- sensitive marketing data that is used to determine whether or not to send the individual a catalog), but is readily available and inexpensive to provide, an organization would have to provide access to factual information that the organization stores about the individual. The information concerned could include facts obtained from the individual, facts gathered in the course of a transaction, or facts obtained from others that pertain to the individual.

--- Page 28 ---
26 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Consistent with the fundamental n ature of access, organizations should always make good faith efforts to provide access. For example, where certain information needs to be protected and can be readily separated from other information subject to an access request, the organization should r edact the protected information and make available the other information. If an organization determines that access should be denied in any particular instance, it should provide the individual requesting access with an explanation of why it has made that determination and a contact point for any further inquiries. Q2: What is confidential commercial information and may organizations deny access in order to safeguard it? A2: Confidential commercial information (as that term is used in the Federal Rules of C ivil Procedure on discovery) is information which an organization has taken steps to protect from disclosure, where disclosure would help a competitor in the market. The particular computer program an organization uses, such as a modeling program, or the details of that program may be confidential commercial information. Where confidential commercial information can be readily separated from other information subject to an access request, the organization should redact the confidential commercial informatio n and make available the non- confidential information. Organizations may deny or limit access to the extent that granting it would reveal its own confidential commercial information as defined above, such as marketing inferences or classifications generate d by the organization, or the confidential commercial information of another where such information is subject to a contractual obligation of confidentiality in circumstances where such an obligation of confidentiality would normally be undertaken or impos ed. Q3: In providing access, may an organization disclose to individuals personal information about them derived from its data bases or is access to the data base itself required? A3: Access can be provided in the form of disclosure by an organization to t he individual and does not require access by the individual to an organization’s data base. Q4: Does an organization have to restructure its data bases to be able to provide access?

--- Page 29 ---
27 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce A4: Access needs to be provided only to the extent that an organi zation stores the information. The Access Principle does not itself create any obligation to retain, maintain, reorganize, or restructure personal information files. Q5: These replies make clear that access may be denied in certain circumstances. In what other circumstances may an organization deny individuals access to their personal information? A5: Such circumstances are limited, and any reasons for denying access must be specific. An organization can refuse to provide access to information to the extent that disclosure is likely to interfere with the safeguarding of important countervailing public interests, such as national security; defense; or public security. In addition, where personal information is processed solely for research or statistical purposes, access may be denied. Other reasons for denying or limiting access are: • Interference with execution or enforcement of the law, including the prevention, investigation or detection of offenses or the right to a fair trial; • Interference with private ca uses of action, including the prevention, investigation or detection of legal claims or the right to a fair trial; • Disclosure of personal information pertaining to other individual(s) where such references cannot be redacted; • Breaching a legal or other professional privilege or obligation; • Breaching the necessary confidentiality of future or ongoing negotiations, such as those involving the acquisition of publicly quoted companies; • Prejudicing employee security investigations or grievance proceedings; • Prejudicing the confidentiality that may be necessary for limited periods in connection with employee succession planning and corporate re- organizations; or • Prejudicing the confidentiality that may be necessary in connection with monitoring, inspection or regul atory functions connected with sound economic or financial management; or • Other circumstances in which the burden or cost of providing access would be disproportionate or the legitimate rights or interests of others would be violated.

--- Page 30 ---
28 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce An organization which claims an exception has the burden of demonstrating its applicability (as is normally the case). As noted above, the reasons for denying or limiting access and a contact point for further inquiries should be given to individuals. Q6: Can an organizat ion charge a fee to cover the cost of providing access? A6: Yes, t he OECD Guidelines recognize that organizations may charge a fee, provided that it is not excessive. Thus organizations may charge a reasonable fee for access. Charging a fee may be useful i n discouraging repetitive and vexatious requests. Organizations that are in the business of selling publicly available information may thus charge the organization’s customary fee in responding to requests for access. Individuals may alternatively seek access to their information from the organization that originally compiled the data. Access may not be refused on cost grounds if the individual offers to pay the costs. Q7: Is an organization required to provide access to personal information derived from pu blic records? A7: To clarify first, public records are those records kept by government agencies or entities at any level that are open to consultation by the public in general. It is not necessary to apply the Access Principle to such information as long as it is not combined with other personal information, apart from when small amounts of non- public record information are used for indexing or organizing public record information. However, any conditions for consultation established by the relevant jurisdiction are to be respected. Where public record information is combined with other non- public record information (other than as specifically noted above), however, an organization must provide access to all such information, assuming it is not subject to other permitted exceptions. Q8: Does the Access Principle have to be applied to publicly available personal information?

--- Page 31 ---
29 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce A8: As with public record information ( see Q7), it is not necessary to provide access to information that is already publicly available to the public at large, as long as it is not combined with non- publicly available information. Q9: How can an organization protect itself against repetitious or vexatious requests for access? A9: An organization does not have to respond to such r equests for access. For these reasons, organizations may charge a reasonable fee and may set reasonable limits on the number of times within a given period that access requests from a particular individual will be met. In setting such limitations, an organ ization should consider such factors as the frequency with which information is updated, the purpose for which the data are used, and the nature of the information. Q10: How can an organization protect itself against fraudulent requests for access? A10: An organization is not required to provide access unless it is supplied with sufficient information to allow it to confirm the identity of the person making the request. Q11: Is there a time within which responses must be provided to access requests? A11: Yes, organizations should respond without excessive delay and within a reasonable time period. This requirement may be satisfied in different ways as the explanatory memorandum to the 1980 OECD Privacy Guidelines states. For example, a data controller who pr ovides information to data subjects at regular intervals may be exempted from obligations to respond at once to individual requests. IX. Human Resources Q1: Is the transfer from Switzerland to the United States of personal information collected in the context of the employment relationship covered by the Safe Harbor ? A1: Yes, where a company in Switzerland transfers personal information about its employees (past or present) collected in the context of the employment relationship, to a parent, affiliate, or unaffiliated service provider in the United States participating in the Safe Harbor , the transfer enjoys the benefits of the Safe Harbor . In such cases, the collection of the information and its processing prior to transfer will have been subject to Swiss data protection laws, and any conditions for or restrictions on its transfer according to those laws will have to be respected.

--- Page 32 ---
30 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce The Safe Harbor Principles are relevant only when individually identified or identifiable records are transferred or acces sed. Statistical reporting relying on aggregate employment data and/or the use of anonymized or pseudonymized data does not raise privacy concerns. Q2: How do the Notice and Choice Principles apply to such information? A2: A U.S. organization that has received employee information from Switzerland under the Safe Harbor may disclose it to third parties and/or use it for different purposes only in accordance with the Notice and Choice Principles. For example, where an organization intends to use personal information collected through the employment relationship for non- employment -related purposes, such as marketing communications, the U.S. organization must provide the affected individuals with choice before doing so, unless they have already authorized the us e of the information for such purposes. Moreover, such choices must not be used to restrict employment opportunities or take any punitive action against such employees. In addition, employers should make reasonable efforts to accommodate employee privacy preferences. This could include, for example, restricting access to the data, anonymizing certain data, or assigning codes or pseudonyms when the actual names are not required for the management purpose at hand. To the extent and for the period necessary to avoid prejudicing the legitimate interests of the organization in making promotions, appointments, or other similar employment decisions, an organization does not need to offer notice and choice. Q3: How does the Access Principle apply? A3: The FAQs on ac cess provide guidance on reasons which may justify denying or limiting access on request in the human resources context. Of course, employers in Switzerland must comply with local regulations and ensure that Swiss employees have access to such information as is required by Swiss law, regardless of the location of data processing and storage. The Safe Harbor requires that an organization processing such data in the United States will cooperate in providing such access either directly or through the Swiss employer.

--- Page 33 ---
31 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Q4: How will enforcement be handled for employee data under the Safe Harbor Principles? A4: In so far as information is used only in the context of the employment relationship, primary responsibility for the data vis -à-vis the employee remains with the company in Switzerland. It follows that, where Swiss employees make complaints about violations of their data protection rights and are not satisfied with the results of internal review, complaint, and appeal procedures (or any applicable grievance procedures under a contract with a trade union), they should be directed to the Commissioner or labor authority in the jurisdiction where the employee works. This also includes cases where the alleged mishandling of their personal information has tak en place in the United States, is the responsibility of the U.S. organization that has received the information from the employer and not of the employer and thus involves an alleged breach of the Safe Harbor Principles, rather than of the FADP. This will be the most efficient way to address the often overlapping rights and obligations imposed by local labor law and labor agreements as well as data protection law. A U.S. organization participating in the Safe Harbor that uses Swiss human resources data transferred from Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship and that wishes such transfers to be covered by the Safe Harbor must therefore commit to cooperate in investigations by and to comply with the advice of the Commissioner in such cases. The Commissioner in this way will notify the Department of Commerce. If a U.S. org anization participating in the Safe Harbor wishes to transfer human resources data from Switzerland and the Commissioner has not so agreed, the provisions of FAQ 5: the Role of the Commissioner will apply. X. Data Processing by Third Parties Q: When data is transferred from Switzerland to the United States only for processing purposes, will a contract be required, regardless of participation by the processor in the Safe Harbor ? A: Yes, d ata controllers in Switzerland are always required to enter into a contract when a transfer for mere processing is made, whether the processing operation is carried out inside or outside Switzerland. (Article 10a FADP) The purpose of the contract is to protect the interests of the data controller (i.e. the person or body who determines the purposes and means of processing, who retains full responsibility for the data vis -à-vis the individual(s) concerned) . The contract thus specifies the process ing to be carried out and any measures necessary to ensure that the data are kept secure.

--- Page 34 ---
32 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce A U.S. organization participating in the Safe Harbor and receiving personal information from Switzerland merely for processing thus does not have to apply the Principles to this information, because the controller in Switzerland remains responsible for it vis -à-vis the individual in accordance with the relevant Swiss provisions (which may be more stringent than the equivalent Safe Harbor Principles). Because adequate protection is provided by Safe Harbor participants, contracts with Safe Harbor participants for mere processing do not require prior authorization (or such authorization will be granted automatically) as would be required for contracts with recipient s not participating in the Safe Harbor or otherwise not providing adequate protection. XI. Dispute Resolution and Enforcement How should the dispute resolution requirements of the Enforcement Principle be implemented, and how will an organization’s persis tent failure to comply with the Principles be handled? A: The Enforcement Principle sets out the requirements for Safe Harbor enforcement. How to meet the requirements of point (b) of the Principle is set out in FAQ 7: Verification . This FAQ addresses points (a) 2 and (c)3, both of which require independent recourse mechanisms. These mechanisms may take different forms, but they must meet the Enforcement Principle’s requirements. Organizations may satisfy the requirements through the following: • Compliance wi th private sector developed privacy programs that incorporate the Safe Harbor Principles into their rules and that include effective enforcement mechanisms of the type described in the Enforcement Principle; • Compliance with legal or regulatory supervisory authorities that provide for handling of individual complaints and dispute resolution; or • Commitment to cooperate with the Commissioner or authorized representatives. 2Section (a) of the Enforcement P rinciple concerns the obligation to provide “readily av ailable and affordable independent recourse mechanisms by which each individual’s complaints and disputes are investigated and resolved by reference to the Principles and damages a warded where the applicable law or private sector initiatives so provide” 3 Section (c) of the Enforcement P rinciple concerns the obligation to “remedy problems arising out of failure to comply with the Principles by organizations announcing their adherence to them and consequences for such organizations.”

--- Page 35 ---
33 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce This list is intended to be illustrative and not limiting. The private sector may design other mechanisms to provide enforcement, so long as they meet the requirements of the Enforcement Principle and the FAQs. Please note that the Enforcement Principle’s requirements are additional to the requirements set forth in paragraph 3 of the introduction to the Principles that self -regulatory efforts must be enforceable under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act or similar statute. Recourse Mechanisms: Consumers should be encouraged to raise any complaints they may have with the relevan t organization before proceeding to independent recourse mechanisms. Whether a recourse mechanism is independent is a factual question that can be demonstrated in a number of ways, for example, by transparent composition and financing or a proven track rec ord. As required by the Enforcement Principle, the recourse available to individuals must be readily available and affordable. Dispute resolution bodies should look into each complaint received from individuals unless they are obviously unfounded or frivol ous. This does not preclude the establishment of eligibility requirements by the organization operating the recourse mechanism, but such requirements should be transparent and justified (for example to exclude complaints that fall outside the scope of the program or are for consideration in another forum), and should not have the effect of undermining the commitment to look into legitimate complaints. In addition, recourse mechanisms should provide individuals with full and readily available information abo ut how the dispute resolution procedure works when they file a complaint. Such information should include notice about the mechanism’s privacy practices, in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles, where dispute resolution bodies are not required to conform with the Enforcement Principle. They may derogate from the Principles where they encounter conflicting obligations or explicit authorizations in the performance of their specific tasks. They should also co- operate in the development of tools such as s tandard complaint forms to facilitate the complaint resolution process. Remedies and Sanctions : The result of any remedies provided by the dispute resolution body should be that the effects of non- compliance are reversed or corrected by the organization, i n so far as feasible, and that future processing by the organization will be in conformity with the Principles and, where appropriate, that processing of the personal data of the individual who has brought the complaint will cease.

--- Page 36 ---
34 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Sanctions need to be rigorous enough to ensure compliance by the organization with the Principles. A range of sanctions of varying degrees of severity will allow dispute resolution bodies to respond appropriately to varying degrees of non- compliance. Sanctions should inc lude both publicity for findings of non-compliance and the requirement to delete data in certain circumstances. Dispute resolution bodies have discretion about the circumstances in which they use these sanctions. The sensitivity of the data concerned is on e factor to be taken into consideration in deciding whether deletion of data should be required, as is whether an organization has collected, used or disclosed information in blatant contravention of the Principles. Other sanctions could include suspension and removal of a seal, compensation for individuals for losses incurred as a result of non- compliance and injunctive orders. Private sector dispute resolution bodies and self -regulatory bodies must notify failures of Safe Harbor organizations to comply wi th their rulings to the governmental body with applicable jurisdiction or to the courts, as appropriate, and to notify the Department of Commerce (or its designee). FTC Action : The FTC has committed to reviewing on a priority basis referrals received from privacy self -regulatory organizations, such as BBB and TRUSTe, and the Commissioner alleging non- compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles to determine whether Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce has been violated. If the FTC concludes that is has reason(s) to believe Section 5 has been violated, it may resolve the matter by seeking an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting the challenged practices or by filing a complaint in a federal district court, which if successful could result in a federal court order to same effect. The FTC may obtain civil penalties for violations of an administrative cease and desist order and may pursue civil or criminal contempt for violation of a federal court order. The FTC will notify the Department of Commerce of any such actions it takes. The Department of Commerce encourages other government bodies to notify it of the final disposition of any such referrals or other rulings determining adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles. Persistent Failure to Comply : If an organization persistently fails to comply with the Principles, it is no longer entitled to benefit from the Safe Harbor . Persistent failure to comply arises where an organization that has self -certified to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) refuses to comply with a final determination by any self - regulatory or government body or where such a body determines that an organization frequently fails to comply with the Principles to the point where its c laim to comply is no longer credible. In these cases, the organization must promptly notify the Department of Commerce (or its designee) of such facts. Failure to do so may be actionable under the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. § 1001).

--- Page 37 ---
35 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce The Department (or its designee) will indicate on the public list it maintains of organizations self -certifying adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles any notification it receives of persistent failure to comply, whether it is received from the organization itself, f rom a self -regulatory body, or from a government body, but only after first providing thirty (30) days’ notice and an opportunity to respond to the organization that has failed to comply. Accordingly, the public list maintained by the Department of Commerc e (or its designee) will make clear which organizations are assured and which organizations are no longer assured of Safe Harbor benefits. An organization applying to participate in a self -regulatory body for the purposes of re- qualifying for the Safe Harb or must provide that body with full information about its prior participation in the Safe Harbor . XII. Choice - Timing of Opt Out Q: Does the Choice Principle permit an individual to exercise choice only at the beginning of a relationship or at any time? A: Generally, the purpose of the Choice Principle is to ensure that personal information is used and disclosed in ways that are consistent with the individual’s expectations and choices. Accordingly, an individual should be able to exercise “opt out” (or c hoice) of having personal information used for direct marketing at any time subject to reasonable limits established by the organization, such as giving the organization time to make the opt out effective. An organization may also require sufficient inform ation to confirm the identity of the individual requesting the “opt out”. In the United States, individuals may be able to exercise this option through the use of a central “opt out” program such as the Direct Marketing Association’s Mail Preference Servic e. Organizations that participate in the Direct Marketing Association’s Mail Preference Service should promote its availability to consumers who do not wish to receive commercial information. In any event, an individual should be given a readily available and affordable mechanism to exercise this option.

--- Page 38 ---
36 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Similarly, an organization may use information for certain direct marketing purposes when it is impracticable to provide the individual with an opportunity to opt out before using the information, if the organization promptly gives the individual such opportunity at the same time (and upon request at any time) to decline (at no cost to the individual) to receive any further direct marketing communications and the organization complies with the indi vidual’s wishes. XIII. Travel Information Q: When can airline passenger reservation and other travel information, such as frequent flyer or hotel reservation information and special handling needs, such as meals to meet religious requirements or physical assistance, be transferred to organizations located outside Switzerland? A: Such information may be transferred in several different circumstances. Under Article 6(2) FADP, personal data may be transferred to a third country “in the absence of legislation that guarantees adequate protection within the meaning of Article 6(1)” on the condition that : • It is necessary to provide the services requested by the consumer or to fulfill the terms of an agreement, such as a “frequent flyer” agreement; or • It has been unambiguously consented to by the consumer in the specific case. U.S. organizations subscribing to the Safe Harbor provide adequate protection for personal data and may therefore receive data transfers from Switzerland without meeting those conditions or other conditions set out in Article 6 FADP. Since the Safe Harbor includes specific rules for sensitive information, such information (which may need to be collected, for example, in connection with customers’ needs for physical assistance) may be included in transfers to Safe Harbor participants. In all cases, however, the organization transferring the information has to respect the law in Switzerland, which may inter alia impose special conditions for the handling of sensitive data.

37 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce XIV. Pharmac eutical and Medical Products Q1: If personal data are collected in Switzerland and transferred to the United States for pharmaceutical research and/or other purposes, do Swiss laws or the Safe Harbor Principles apply? A1: Swiss law applies to the collection of the personal data and to any processing that takes place prior to the transfer to the United States. The Safe Harbor Principles apply to the data once they have been transferred to the United States. Data used for pharmaceutical research and other pur poses should be anonymized when appropriate. Q2: Personal data developed in specific medical or pharmaceutical research studies often play a valuable role in future scientific research. Where personal data collected for one research study are transferred t o a U.S. organization in the Safe Harbor , may the organization use the data for a new scientific research activity? A2: Yes, if appropriate notice and choice have been provided in the first instance. Such a notice should provide information about any futur e specific uses of the data, such as periodic follow -up, related studies, or marketing. It is understood that not all future uses of the data can be specified, since a new research use could arise from new insights on the original data, new medical discoveries and advances, and public health and regulatory developments. Where appropriate, the notice should therefore include an explanation that personal data may be used in future medical and pharmaceutical research activities that are unanticipated. If the use is not consistent with the general research purpose(s) for which the data were originally collected, or to which the individual has consented subsequently, new consent must be obtained. Q3: What happens to an individual’s data if a participant decides v oluntarily or at the request of the sponsor to withdraw from the clinical trial? A3: Participants may decide or be asked to withdraw from a clinical trial at any time. Any data collected previous to withdrawal may still be processed along with other data c ollecte d as part of the clinical trial; however, if this was made clear to the participant in the notice at the time he or she agreed to participate.

--- Page 40 ---
38 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Question 4: Pharmaceutical and medical device companies are allowed to provide personal data from clinical trials conducted in Switzerland to regulators in the United States for regulatory and supervision purposes. Are similar transfers allowed to parties other than regulators, such as company locations and other researchers? A4: Yes, consistent with the Principles of Notice and Choice. Q5: To ensure objectivity in many clinical trials, participants, and often investigators, as well, cannot be given access to information about which treatment each participant may be receiving. Doing so would jeopardize the validity of the research study and results. Will participants in such clinical trials (referred to as “blinded” studies) have access to the data on their treatment during the trial? A5: No, such access does not have to be provided to a participant if this restriction has been explained when the participant entered the trial and the disclosure of such information would jeopardize the integrity of the research effort. Agreement to participate in the trial under these conditions is a reasonable forgoing of the right of access. Following the conclusion of the trial and analysis of the results, participants should have access to their data if they request it. They should seek it primarily from the physician or other health care provider from whom they receiv ed treatment within the clinical trial, or secondarily from the sponsoring company. Q6: Does a pharmaceutical or medical device firm have to apply the Safe Harbor Principles with respect to notice, choice, onward transfer, and access in its product safety and efficacy monitoring activities, including the reporting of adverse events and the tracking of patients/subjects using certain medicines or medical devices ( e.g., a pacemaker)? A6: No, to the extent that adherence to the Principles interferes with compl iance with regulatory requirements. This is true both with respect to reports by, for example, health care providers to pharmaceutical and medical device companies, and with respect to reports by pharmaceutical and medical device companies to government agencies like the Food and Drug Administration. Q7: Invariably, research data are uniquely key -coded at their origin by the principal investigator so as not to reveal the identity of individual data subjects. Pharmaceutical companies sponsoring such research do not receive the key. The unique key code is held only by the researcher, so that he/she can identify the research subject under special circumstances ( e.g., if follow -up medical attention is required). Does a transfer from Switzerland to the United States of data coded in this way constitute a transfer of personal data that is subject to the Safe Harbor Principles? A7: No. This would not constitute a transfer of personal data that would be subject to the Principles.

39 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce XV. Public Record and Publicly Available Information Q: Is it necessary to apply the Notice, Choice and Onward Transfer Principles to public record information or publicly available information? A: It is not necessary to apply the Notice, Choice or Onward Transfer Principles to public r ecord information, as long as it is not combined with non- public record information and as long as any conditions for consultation established by the relevant jurisdiction are respected. Also, it is generally not necessary to apply the Notice, Choice or On ward Transfer Principles to publicly available information unless the Swiss transferor indicates that such information is subject to restrictions that require application of those Principles by the organization for the uses it intends. Organizations will have no liability for how such information is used by those obtaining such information from published materials. Where an organization is found to have intentionally made personal information public in contravention of the Principles so that it or others ma y benefit from these exceptions, it will cease to qualify for the benefits of the Safe Harbor .

49 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Definitions “Personal Information” or “Information” means information that (1) is transferred from the EU and Switzerland to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about, or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual. “Sensitive Personal Information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual’s health. Principles Notice Company shall inform an individual of the purpose for which it col lects and uses the Personal Information and the types of non- agent third parties to which the Company discloses or may disclose that Information. Company shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to the Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before the Company uses or discloses the I nformation for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected. Choice The Company will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Information is (1) to be disclosed to a third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, the Company will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt out) consent to the disclosure of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Company shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information.

54 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Appendix C: Dispute Resolution and Enforcement Options Under the Safe Harbor Enforcement Principle, organizations self -certifying to one or both of the Safe Harbor Frameworks must establish an independent recourse mechanism (i.e. third party dispute resolution provider) to investigate unresolved complaints. An organization wishing to self -certify must ensure th at a suitable mechanism is in place prior to self -certification. If an organization ’s self-certification covers human resources data received from Switzerland and/or the EU/EEA regarding its own employees (i.e. organization human resources data, as opposed to customer/client human resources data) , then i t must agree to cooperate and comply with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and/or the EU dat a protection authorities (DPAs) with respect to such data. Provision has also been made for organizations to choose, even whe re organization human resources data are not involved, to cooperate with the appropriate data protection authorities in order to satisfy the Enforcement Principle’s dispute resolution and remedy requirements. In short, where an organization’s self -certific ation does not cover organization human resources data it may meet the relevant requirements by : a) Putting in place a suitable private sector developed mechanism ; or b) Cooperating and complying with the appropri ate data protection authorities In contrast, where an organization’s self -certification does cover organization human resources data it may meet the relevant requirements by : a) Cooperating and complying with the appropriate data protection authorities with respect to all types of data; or b) Cooperating and complying with the appropriate data protection authorities exclusively with respect to organization human resources data and using a suitable private sector developed mechanism for all other types of data (e.g. customer/client, clinical trial, etc.)

56 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce BBB EU Safe Harbor Dispute Resolution Procedure The Council of Better Business Bureaus (“BBB”) is an unbiased organization that fosters honest and responsive relationships between business es and consumers – instilling consumer confidence and contributing to a trustworthy marketplace. BBB provides objective advice, free business Reliability Reports and charity Wise Giving Reports, and educational information on topics affecting marketplace trust. To further promote trust, BBB also offers complaint and dispute resolution support for consumers and businesses when there is difference in viewpoints. The BBB EU Safe Harbor Dispute Resolution Procedure (“Procedure”) fulfills the dispute resolution mechanism requirement of the Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Certification Program. As a recognized leader in business -to-consumer dispute resolution programs, the BBB provides for the review of complaints filed by EU citizens alleging that a business participating in the Procedure has failed to comply with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. In the event that the BBB Procedure receives a complaint from an EU citizen, the first step in the dispute resolution process is for the BBB Procedure to contact t he business. The BBB Procedure will ensure that the complainant has made a good faith effort to resolve his or her claim directly with the business, and then will attempt an informal mediation between the EU citizen and the business with the goal of rectif ying the EU citizen’s concern. If the BBB Procedure is unable to address the EU citizen’s concerns informally with the business, the second step is the more formal Data Privacy Review (“Review”). In the Review, the complainant submits a statement of his or her complaint, which is forwarded to the business. The business replies with an answer. Each party has one further opportunity to respond. When all information has been submitted, the BBB Procedure reviews the information and will issue a decision. If appropriate, the BBB Procedure will recommend corrective action to the business to ensure that all Safe Harbor Privacy Principles are met. The third step in the Procedure is the Data Privacy Appeal. Both parties have the right to appeal the Review decision. In the event of an appeal, the case will be forwarded by the BBB to an independent expert in the privacy field. The appeal will be determined by the expert, who will issue a final decision in the case.

59 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Appendix D: Swiss Economy and Data P rotection Switzerland and the United States are bound by close ties. Known as the "Sister Republics," they have a long history of shared democratic values. Both countries rely on an open market economy, support free enterprise, private initiative, a compet itive market , and aim at high living standards. Switzerland is not a Member of the European Union. Rooted in tradition and history, the Swiss do not want to give up very comprehensive democratic rights and put a strong emphasis on a very carefully crafted political system establishing a delicate balance between four linguistic and several religious groups. For the time being, they manage their relations with the EU with several economic agreements. Swiss Economy i n Brief Switzerland is a small country wit h a population of only about 7.6 million people, including 1.7 million foreigners. Nevertheless, it is one of the world's most advanced and prosperous nations. Considering GDP per capita, Switzerland is one of the richest countries in the world. Services i s the largest sector of the economy with 72% of the labor force, followed by industry (24%) and agriculture (4%). Tourism, financial services, insurance, commerce, transport and health are very important branches of the tertiary sector. The industrial sect or has become very specialized in the past twenty years. Swiss machinery, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, medical instruments and watches are sold all around the globe. Swiss manufacturing has a worldwide reputation for high- quality standards, reliability and diligence, accounts for 20% of GDP and is thus pivotal in creating jobs and wealth. Switzerland aims at maintaining in the future a strong manufacturing sector because it is essential for keeping, in turn, a strong services sector. U.S.-Swiss Economic Rel ations Switzerland is the 16th largest foreign market for the U.S. - ahead of India, Italy and Russia On the other hand, the U.S. is the second most important export market for Switzerland. Bilateral trade flows are significant: in 2010, Swiss exports to the U .S. amounted to USD 19.1 billion, while imports from the U.S. to Switzerland added up to USD 20.7 billion. Switzerland imports more goods from the U.S. than Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Portugal combined! 4 Source of data in t his section: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis

--- Page 62 ---
60 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Regarding trade in services, Swi tzerland is the 8th largest export market for the U.S. (2010: USD 20.3 bn) - ahead of France, India, and Brazil. Conversely, Switzerland is the 6th largest provider of services to the USA. With a value of USD 19.7 billion, Switzerland outpaces Mexico, France, China, and India. Swiss -U.S. investment relations are very strong. Attracted by excellent infrastructure, highly -educated work force and a favorable tax and regulatory environment, numerous U.S. firms have established operations in Switzerland. U.S. direct investment stock in Switzerland is estimated at USD 143.6 billion; more than in China, Brazil, and Russia combined! At the same time, many Swiss firms show a significant presence in the U.S. With an estimated direct investment stock of USD 140.7 bi llion (2009), a figure equivalent to about 7% of all foreign direct investments in the U.S., Switzerland is the 8th most important foreign direct investor in the U.S. . Over the years, Switzerland and the U.S. have concluded numerous agreements and have str engthened their ties with a Joint Economic Commission (2000) dealing with broad strategic issues, a Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum (2006) focusing on market access for firms and cooperation schemes, and, a political dialogue (2006) in areas of comm on interest such as democracy and security. Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection Switzerland and the United States take different approaches when it comes to the protection of privacy. The U.S. uses a sectoral approach that relies on a mix of legislation, regulation , and self -regulation. Switzerlan d, however, relies on comprehensive legislation that requires an independent government data protection agency, registration of data bases with this agency, and in some cases prior information before personal data processing may begin. For a better understanding of the Swiss approach regarding personal data protection, it may be worthwhile to highlight the key elements of the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (FADP). The purpose of the FADP is to protect the pri vacy, interests , and fundamental rights of data subjects. Furthermore, it has as its central goal the maintenance of good data file practice; and the facilitation of international data exchange by providing a comparable level of protection.

--- Page 63 ---
61 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce In Switz erland, the right to privacy is guaranteed in article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The Federal Data Protection Act (FADP) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Ordinance (DPO) entered into force on July 1, 1993. The FADP extends the protection of private persons (natural and legal persons) provided by the Swiss Civil Code (SCC) and regulates in a more detailed manner the processing of data by Federal authorities . The FADP , however, does not apply to the Cantons. The Cantons have their own data prot ection legislation. The FADP provides an overall framework and deals with data protection using principles similar to those applied in other countries (especially in the EU). Private persons need no authorization to process data and registration with the F ederal Data Register is required only in certain specific cases. The law covers both the private and public sector, in order to ensure harmonized development and to facilitate the access of individuals to the data protection system. On March 24, 2006, a re vision of the FADP as well as a federal decree were adopted, strengthening the position of data subjects by requiring greater transparency in the processing of personal data. In particular, it introduces a duty of information towards data subjects when col lecting personal data that are either especially sensitive or concern a personality profile. New rules also apply to the cross -border transfer of data. As a result, it is no longer necessary to report the transmission of personal data that are sent outside Switzerland as long as the receiving country guarantees adequate data protection. Provisions relating to the notification of data files have been adapted to the new transparency requirements. A new and innovative provision introduces the possibility of obtaining the certification of personal data processing products and systems, and, under certain conditions, requires the owners of data sets to designate a data protection officer. Last, but not least, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commi ssioner (FDPIC) is empowered to appeal any order of the Federal Chancellery or of the Departments (Ministries) if a recommendation he has made is rejected. He also might refer a matter to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision if a private person does not comply with or rejects a recommendation. These changes have been in effect since 1st January 2008. Main Provisions of the Federal Data Protection Act The FADP is very wide in its scope and applies to processing of personal data carried out by Federal authorities, private organizations (including legal persons) , and individual private persons (excluding those for normal private purposes). D ata collections kept by journalists and by the media are covered under Art. 10, and benefit from several exempt ions (i.e. provisions regarding freedom of the press and speech).

--- Page 64 ---
62 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce The law covers data relating to both private and legal persons and applies to electronic data processing (EDP) as well as manual files (Art. 2, Art. 3 para. a). Sensitive data - such as that relating to religion, political beliefs, trade union activities, health, race, social assistance or criminal records - enjoy more enhanced protection in various respects. Any data processing must ensure accuracy and be balanced. The collection of personal data and in particular the purpose of its processing must be evident to the data subject (Art.4 para. 4). In the case of processing of sensitive personal data or personality profiles , the data subject must give its explicit consent. Furthermore, data must be secured against unauthorized access (Art. 7) , and data subjects must have a right of access (Art. 8) and have the right to correct errors (Art. 5). The processing of personal data may be assigned to third parties by agreement or by law if the d ata is processed only in the manner permitted for the instructing party itself and if it is not prohibited by a statutory or contractual duty of confidentiality (Art. 10a). In addition, the instructing party must in particular ensure that the third party g uarantees data security. All data files held by Federal authorities must be registered with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC). Private persons only have to register data collections if they include sensitive data or if the data is communicated regularly to third persons, and where the file controller is not under a legal obligation to process the data. With the revision of the FADP, the notification procedure has been simplified and the owners of data sets can register on line. The demand for more transparency in data processing (Art. 4, para. 4, Art. 14) also has an impact on the duty to register data collections. Federal bodies must continue to register their data collections as in the past. However, the requirement has been extended to cover the private sector. As a result, all owners of data sets will be required to register their collections if they regularly process highly sensitive personal data or personality profiles, or if they regularly disclose personal data to thir d parties, even if the persons concerned have been duly informed. As a result, it is now compulsory to register all data collections which were not subject to a registration obligation before the entry into force of the revised FADP . Data collections will have to be registered before they can be opened (Art. 11a, para. 4). However, the law also provides for certain exceptions to the compulsory registration requirement (Art. 11a, para. 5). The Federal Council established the detailed rules relating to the im plementation in the DPO.

63 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Cross -border Data Transfers The FADP regulates the transborder transfer of data in those cases when there is a need for the protection of privacy. The transfer of data abroad is not permitted if adequate data protection cannot be assured (Art. 6 para. 1). Art. 6 FADP needed to be adapted in 2006 as a consequence of the decree of the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personnel Data (Convention ETS 108). The Convention aims at a comparable level of data protection at the highest level possible, and unrestricted transborder data transfer between contracting states; as well as a guarantee that the transfer of personal data to a data recipient who is not covered by the Convention will only be authorized if the recipient state or the recipient organization can guarantee an appropriate level of protection. The notification under the former FADP that required the disclosure of transborder data transfer has been replace d by the duty of care and a selective duty to inform (Art. 6 para. 3 FADP). In general, this means that private individuals and federal bodies transferring data abroad must comply with the principles of FADP (Art. 4 FADP), ensure data security and the righ t to information of persons whose data is being transferred. If data protection cannot be guaranteed, it must be secured through other guarantees according to Art. 6 para. 2 FADP. The appropriateness of protection in the legislation of the target country is ensured when it is in accordance with the principles set out in Convention ETS 108. In order to ascertain compliance with the appropriateness principle, the data exporter may rely on the list of states published by the FDPIC ( http://www.edoeb.admin.ch/themen/00794/00827/index.html?lang=en). The list includes states which are contracting parties to Convention ETS 108 and the additional Protocol, or according to the FDPIC, provide an adequate level of data protection.

92 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Appendix E: U.S. -EU Safe Harbor Framework Background on the U.S.- EU Safe Harbor The European Commission’s Direct ive on Data Protection (the Directive) went into effect in October 1998, and would prohibit the transfer of personal data to non -European Union countries that do not meet the European Union (EU) “adequacy” standard for privacy protection. While the United States and the EU share the goal of enhancing privacy protection for their citizens, the United States takes a different approach to privacy from that taken by the EU. The United States uses a sectoral approach that relies on a mix of legislation, regulati on, and self -regulation. The EU, however, relies on comprehensive legislation that requires, among other things, the creation of independent government data protection agencies, registration of databases with those agencies, and in some instances prior approval before personal data processing may begin. As a result of these differences, the Directive could have significantly hampered the ability of U.S. organizations to engage in a range of trans - Atlantic transactions. In order to bridge these differences and provide a streamlined and cost -effective means for U.S. organizations to satisfy the Directive’s “adequacy” requirement, the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission developed a " Safe Harbor " framework. The U.S. -EU Safe Harbor Framework, which was approved by the EU in 2000, is an important way for U.S. organizations to avoid experiencing interruptions in their business dealings with the EU or facing prosecution by EU Member State authorities under EU Member State privacy laws. Self -certifying to the U.S. -EU Safe Harbor Framework will ensure that EU organizations know that your organization provides "adequate" privacy protection, as defined by the Directive. U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Benefits Benefits for participating U.S. organ izations include: • All 27 EU Member States are bound by the European Commission’s finding of “adequacy” and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway are bound by the European Economic Area (EEA)’s recognition of “adequacy”;

--- Page 95 ---
93 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce • Organizations participating in t he U.S. -EU Safe Harbor program will be deemed to provide “adequate” privacy protection; • Member State requirements for prior approval of data transfers either will be waived or approval will be automatically granted; • Claims brought by EU citizens against U.S. organizations will be heard, subject to limited exceptions, in the U.S.; and • Compliance requirements are streamlined and cost -effective, which should particularly benefit small and medium enterprises. An EU organization can ensure that it is sending i nformation to a U.S. organization participating in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor program by viewing the public list of Safe Harbor organizations posted on the Safe Harbor website. This list contains the names of all U.S. organizations that have self -certified to the U.S.- EU Safe Harbor Framework. This list will be regularly updated, so that it is clear which organizations are assured of Safe Harbor benefits. Please note that an organization does not have to self -certify compliance with the U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Framework in order to self -certify compliance with the U.S. -EU Safe Harbor Framework and vice versa. Although the respective sets of Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, frequently asked questions and answers (FAQs), and enforcement statements of the two Safe Harbor Frameworks are similar, they differ in a number of ways. Understanding the Safe Harbor Frameworks requires familiarity with all of the relevant documents.

94 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Appendix F: Glossary* Access – The ability to view personal information held by an organization – this ability may be complemented by an ability to update or correct the information. Access defines the intersection of identity and data; that is, who can do what to which data. Adequacy – Adequacy refers to the recognition of the existenc e of a legal regime in another country that provides sufficient protection for personal information. The Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) provides that “personal data may not be disclosed abroad if the privacy of the data subjects would be serio usly endangered thereby, in particular due to the absence of legislation that guarantees adequate protection.” As used in the EU Data Protection Directive, a country will be deemed “adequate” if its laws afford individuals rights that are similar to those afforded by the EU Data Protection Directive. In the EU context, if a country offers adequate protection, then data transfers from the European Economic Area (EEA) to that country may occur without any further limitation – provided that the processing meet s the other provisions of the EU Directive. The adequacy concept has been expanded to encompass other types of data transfer mechanisms. For example, the U.S. -Swiss and U.S. -EU Safe Harbor Frameworks provide an adequate level of protection, so companies that are in the relevant Safe Harbor may transfer data from Switzerland and/or the European Union to the United States. Choice – An individual’s ability to determine whether or how personal information collected from him or her may be used or disclosed by the entity that collected the information. Also: The ability of an individual to limit certain uses of his or her personal information. For example, an individual may have choice about whether to permit a company to contact the individual or share the indivi dual’s data with third parties. Data commissioner◊ – Government official that runs a data protection office and that is charged with enforcing a country’s data protection laws. According to the FADP the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) “fulfills his tasks independently without being subject to the Directives of any authority.” These tasks include supervising compliance by federal bodies with the FADP and other federal data protection regulations, advising private persons on data protection matters, and investig ating and making recommendations regarding the private sector. As relates to the private sector, the FDPIC is authorized to investigate whether methods of processing are capable of breaching the privacy of large numbers of persons, data files must be regis tered or there is a duty to provide information.

--- Page 97 ---
95 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce On the basis of his investigations, the FDPIC may recommend that the method of processing be changed or abandoned. If the recommendation made by the FDPIC is not complied with or rejected, he may refer the matter to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision. Included in its list of tasks is the provision of its expert opinion on the extent to which foreign data protection legislation guarantees adequate protection. Data controller – A controller is any person who makes decisions with regard to the processing of personal data, including decisions about the purposes for which the personal data are processed and the manner in which the personal data are processed. The FADP defines a “controller of the data file” as: “private persons or federal bodies that decide on the purpose and content of a data file.” The EU Directive defines a data “controller” as: “the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly w ith others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of processing are determined by national or community laws or regulations, the controller or the specific criteria for his nomination may be designated by national or community law.” Data processor – A data processor is a person who processes the data on behalf of the data controller, but who is under the authority of the data controller. The EU Directive defines data “processor” as: “ a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.” Data protection – The management of personal information. In the United States, “privacy” is the term that is used in policies, laws, and regulations. In contrast, in Switzerland, the European Union, and other countries, the term “data protection” often identifies privacy -related laws and regulations. Data protection authority – See also Data protection office, Data commissioner. Data prote ction office – A government agency that enforces data protection legislation. According to the EU Directive: “Each member state shall provide that one or more public authorities are responsible for monitoring the application within its territory of the pro visions adopted by the member states pursuant to this Directive. These authorities shall act with complete independence in exercising the functions entrusted to them.

--- Page 98 ---
96 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Each authority has investigative powers necessary for the performance of i ts supervisory duties, power to engage in legal proceedings in case of violations. Each supervisory authority shall hear claims lodged by any person, or by an association representing that person.” See also Data protection authority, Data commissioner. Data subject – Term used in some data protection litigation to describe an individual who is the subject of a personal data record. Deceptive trade practices – In the context of U.S. federal law, a term associated with corporate entities that mislead or mis represent products or services to consumers and customers. These practices are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission at the federal level and typically by the Attorney General's Office of Consumer Protection at the state level. These laws typically pro vide both for enforcement by the government to stop the practice and individual actions for damages brought by consumers who are hurt by the practices. Dispute resolution – The response to a valid complaint or grievance, or the action taken to correct faulty information, or to make amends for harm or inconvenience caused to an individual. EU Data Protection Directive (EU Directive) – Several directives deal with personal data usage, but the most important is the general policy approved by the European Comm ission in 1995 (95/46/EC) which protects individuals’ privacy and personal data use. The EU Directive was adopted in 1995 and became effective in 1998. The EU Directive recognizes the European view that privacy is a fundamental human right, and establishes a general comprehensive legal framework that is aimed at protecting individuals and promoting individual choice regarding the processing of personal data. The EU Directive imposes an onerous set of requirements on any person that collects or processes dat a pertaining to individuals in their personal or professional capacity. It is based on a set of data protection principles, which include the legitimate basis, purpose limitation, data quality, proportionality, and transparency principles, data security and confidentiality, data subjects’ rights of access, rectification, deletion, and objection, restrictions on onwards transfers, additional protection where special categories of data and direct marketing are involved, and a prohibition on automated individual decisions. The EU Directive applies to all sectors of industry, from financial institutions to consumer goods companies, and from list brokers to any employer. The EU Directive’s key provisions impose serious restrictions on personal data processing, grant individual rights to “data subjects,” and set forth specific procedural obligations, including notification to national authority.

--- Page 99 ---
97 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce The EU Directive has been supplemented by additional directives, including a specific provision for the telecommunications sector (2002/58) as well as for e- commerce. European Econ omic Area (EEA)◊ – The EEA allows Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway to participate in the EU's internal market without a conventional EU membership. These three countries apply EEA law, which is identical to all EU legislation related to the single market, with the exception of legislation on agriculture, fisheries, and fiscal issues. The EEA, however, is not a customs union. Switzerland is not a member of the EEA, but has concluded a large number of bilateral agreements with the EU covering a significant part of EEA law. European Union (EU) – The European Union is an organization of European countries dedicated to increasing economic integration and strengthening cooperation among its members. The European Union was involved in the development of the Saf e Harbor Principles that affect data flows from the European Union into the United States. As of July 2008, the member states include: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) – The U.S. Federal Trade Commission enforces a variety of federal antitrust and cons umer protection laws, including the Safe Harbor Principles. The FTC seeks to ensure that the nation’s markets function competitively, and are vigorous, efficient, and free of undue restrictions. The FTC also works to enhance the smooth operation of the mar ketplace by eliminating acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive. Member state – In EU documents, this term refers to a country that is a full member of the European Union. See European Union. Notice – A written description of an entity’s practices with respect to its collection, use and disclosure of personal information. A private notice typically includes a description of what personal information the entity collects, how the entity uses the information, with whom it shares the information, whether the information is secured, and whether an individual has any choices as to how the entity uses the information. Opt-in – A consumer’s expression of affirmative consent based upon a specific act of the consumer.

--- Page 100 ---
98 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Opt-out – A consumer’s exercise of choice through an affirmative request that a particular use of disclosure of data not occur. Personal data – The FADP defines “personal data (data)” as: “all information relating to an identified or identifiable person.” The EU Directive defines “ personal data” as: “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject')” and explains that an “identifiable person” is “one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” Personal information – Any information that (i) relates to an individual and (ii) identifies or can be used to identify the individual. Such i nformation may include an individual’s name, postal address, e- mail address, telephone number, Social Security number, or other unique identifier. Privacy – The appropriate use of personal information under the circumstances. What is appropriate will depend on context, law, and the individual’s expectations; also, the right of an individual to control the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. Privacy policy – An organization’s standard pertaining to the user information it collects and what is done with the information after it is collected. Privacy seal program – Self-regulatory regimes that certify compliance with a set of standards of privacy protection. Services provide a “trust” mark, as well as independent verification and remediation and dispute resolution mechanisms for online privacy practices. Websites display the program’s seal to indicate that they adhere to these standards. Privacy statement – An organization’s communication regarding its privacy policies, such as what personal information is collected, how it will be used, with whom it will be shared, and whether one has the option to exercise control over how one’s information is used. Privacy statements are frequently posted on w ebsites. Processing of personal data – The FADP defines “processing” as: “any operation with personal data, irrespective of the means applied and the procedure, and in particular the collection, storage, use, revision, disclosure, archiving or destruction of data.”

--- Page 101 ---
99 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce The EU Directive defines “pr ocessing” as: “any operation or set of operations performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dis semination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure, or destruction.” Safe Harbor – The EU Directive and the FADP prohibit the transfer of personal data outside of the European Union and Switzerland respectively, to jurisdictions that do not meet the European “adequacy” standard for privacy protection. While the United States, the European Union, and Switzerland share the goal of privacy protection, the United States uses a sectoral approach that relies on a mix of legislat ion, regulation, and self -regulation, while the European Union and Switzerland rely on comprehensive legislation that requires, among other things, the creation of government data protection agencies. As a result of these different approaches to privacy pr otection, the EU Directive and the FADP could have significantly hampered the ability of U.S. organizations to engage in many trans -Atlantic transactions. In order to bridge the differences in approach and provide a streamlined means for U.S. organizations to comply with the EU data protection requirements, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission developed a “Safe Harbor” framework. The U.S. -EU Safe Harbor Framework, whic h was approved by the EU in 2000, is an important way for U.S. organizations to avoid interruptions in business dealings with the EU. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland developed a separate “Safe Harbor” framework to bridge the differences in approac h and provide a streamlined means for U.S. organizations to comply with Swiss data protection requirements. The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, which was approved in 2009, is an important way for U.S. organizations to avoid interruption in business deal ings with Switzerland. Self-certifying compliance with one or both of the Safe Harbor Frameworks assures European organizations that an organization provides adequate privacy protection, as defined by the relevant data protection law. From a U.S. perspecti ve, the Safe Harbor program is a self -regulatory regime that is only available to organizations that are subject to the enforcement authority of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Transportation. Organizations that are outside of t he jurisdiction of these two agencies are not eligible to join Safe Harbor.

100 The U.S. -Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self- Certification U.S. Department of Commer ce Sensitive personal data / sensitive information – The FADP and the EU Directive distinguish between ordinary personal data, such as name, address, and telephone number, and sensitive personal data, defined as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, health, sex life, and criminal convictions. The processing of such data is prohibited unless specifically allowed by law. Special restrictions apply to the processing of such data. Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP)◊ – The Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Ordinance entered into force in 1993. In 2006, revisions to the FADP and the federal decree were adopted requiring greater transparency in the processing of personal data. In Switzerland, the right to privacy is guaranteed in article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The FADP recognizes the European view that privacy is a fundamental human right, and establishes a general comprehensive legal framework that is aimed at protecting individuals and promoting individual choice regarding the processing of personal data. The law is very wide in its scope and applies to personal data activities carried out by federal authorities, private organizations, and individual private per sons (excluding those for normal private purposes). The FADP covers data relating to both private and legal persons and applies to electronic data processing, as well as manual files. The law is based on a set of data protection principles, which includes: legitimate basis and purpose limitation; data quality; transparency; data security; rights of access, rectification, and deletion; restrictions on onward transfers; and additional protection where special categories of data are involved. The FADP’s key pr ovisions grant individual rights to “data subjects”, and set forth specific procedural obligations. Under the FADP, private persons are only required to register their data sets if they regularly process sensitive personal data or personality profiles or i f they regularly disclose personal data to third parties, even if the data subjects concerned have been duly informed (certain derogations apply). Although it is no longer necessary to report the transfer of personal data outside of Switzerland, the transf er of such data abroad is only permissible if adequate data protection can be assured. *With the exception of those terms followed by the symbol ◊, the definitions for this Glossary were taken with the permission of the International Association of Priv acy Professionals (IAPP), in whole or in part, from the IAPP Certified Information Privacy Professional Training Course Book © 2011 by the International Association of Privacy Professionals https://www.privacyassociation.org/
