State of Idaho Capital Asset M anagement System Office of the State Controller FAS Manual Division of Statewide Accounting _____________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________ FIXED ASSET MANUAL TRANSFERRING AN ASSET TO ANOTHER AGENCY INTRODUCTION Transferring an asset between agencies simply m eans that one agency sends an asset to another agency. The agency transferring the asset out is referred to as the "transfer out" agency and the agency receiving the asset is referr ed to as the "receiving agency". The book value of the asset is an important factor in determining how to record the transaction. If the book value of the asset is less than $5,000, the agency transf erring will treat the transaction as a disposition, e.g., a donation or scrap, us ing transaction codes DD1 through DD4, depending on the class of asset. The receiving agency can enter the acquisition by whatever method seems appropriate. If the book value of the asse t is $5,000 or more, both ag encies should contact the DSAHelpline for assistance. TO TRANSFER AN ASSET WITH A BOOK VALUE OF LESS THAN $5,000 The transfer out agency should dispose of the asset using the following steps: Type 35 at the FAS Main Menu and press ENTER. Enter an A in the FUNCTION field, and enter the property number and component number in the PROP NO and COMP NO fields. Confirm that the property and component number exactly match the record in the FAS Property File (i.e., screen S040). Enter the sequence number (usually 0001) in the SEQ NO field. Enter the transaction code ( FAS TC) for the class code of the property number being disposed. The FAS TC will be DD1, DD2, DD3, or DD 4. (Refer to FAS Descriptor Table 15.) Enter the status code in the STATUS field. For a full disposition, enter the following: • D (disposed) Enter a disposition code (e.g., S (if Sold), D (donated or scrapped), etc.) in the DSP MTH field. (Refer to FAS Descriptor Table 22 for more disposition codes.) Enter the amount of cash act ually received in the ADT AMT field. Enter the three-digit number representing the pe rcentage of the asset being disposed in the DISP % field. For a full disposition, enter 100. Enter the disposition date in the ADT DATE field.
