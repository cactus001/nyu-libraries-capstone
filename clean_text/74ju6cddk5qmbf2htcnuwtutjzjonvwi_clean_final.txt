FORMATTING NOTE: In initiatives, legislative bills and other proposed measures, language that is to be deleted from current statutes is represented by a "strikethrough" character and language that is to be added is underlined. Because these special characters cannot be formatted in all Internet browsers, a different set of symbols is used for presenting these proposals on-line. The symbols are as follows: • Text that is surrounded by (({- text here -})) is text that will be DELETED FROM the existing statute if the proposed measure is approved. • Text that is surrounded by {+ text here +} is text that will be ADDED TO the existing statute if the proposed measure is approved. • {+ NEW SECTION+} (found at the beginning of a section or paragraph) indicates that ALL of the text in that section will become law if the proposed measure is approved. * * * INITIATIVE 710 AN ACT Relating to limiting taxes; amending RCW 84.55.0101; reenacting and amending RCW 84.55.005; adding new sections to chapter 55; adding a new section to chapter 84.36 RCW; creating a new section; and repealing RCW 84.55.092.

LIMITING TAXES BY EXEMPTING VEHICLES FROM PROPERTY TAXES {+ NEW SECTION. +} Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 36 RCW to read as follows: (1) Vehicles are exempted from property taxes. (2) For purposes of this section, "vehicles" include all vehicles licensed under chapter 46.16 RCW including, but not necessarily limited to, personal and business owned cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles, motorcycles, motor homes, campers, travel trailers, and mobile homes held as inventory. (3) The purpose of this section is to exempt from property taxes all vehicles previously exempted from property taxes prior to the adoption by the people of Initiative Measure No. 695, the $30 License Tab Initiative. LIMITING TAXES BY SETTING PROPERTY TAX VALUATIONS TO 1999 LEVELS {+ NEW SECTION. +} Sec. 3. A new section is added to chapter 55 RCW to read as follows: (1) The valuation of every parcel of property is set to 1999 levels. (2) For purposes of this section: (a) "Property" means real property; and (b) "1999 levels" means the true and fair value of property on January 1, 1999. (3) All real property not already assessed at the true and fair value of property on January 1, 1999, shall be reassessed to reflect that valuation. LIMITING TAXES BY LIMITING GROWTH OF PROPERTY TAX VALUATIONS TO 2% PER YEAR {+ NEW SECTION. +} Sec. 4. A new section is added to chapter 55 RCW to read as follows: (1) The valuation of property can only be increased by the rate of inflation, not to exceed 2% per year and only if the value of the property increases. (2) Property valuations shall be reset to reflect values on January 1, 1999, and thereafter, shall be reset to market value when a change of ownership occurs or the property is newly constructed or manufactured. When property valuation is reset due to new construction or manufacture, the new valuation may increase only to the extent the new construction or manufacture increases the present market value of the property. (3) For purposes of this section: (a) "Property" means real and personal property; (b) "Inflation" means the percentage change in the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures for the United States as published for the most recent twelve-month period by the bureau of economic analysis of the federal department of commerce in September of the year before the taxes are payable; (c) "Change of ownership" shall not include the transfer of real property to a spouse or to a trustee for the benefit of a spouse; and (d) "Newly constructed" does not include reconstruction after fire or other natural disaster and does not include maintenance or replacement of existing components, such as roofs, siding, windows, and doors. (4) Property tax valuations shall be reduced when there is a

decline in value. (5) This section is the method for determining true and fair value of property for purposes of chapters 84.40 and 84.41 RCW. By determining true and fair value of property in this manner, real property taxes will be stabilized, uniform, and predictable for all property owners because all property will be valued at 1999 levels and increased by the lesser of the inflation rate or 2% per year and increased only when taxpayers choose to change ownership or construct on the property. Therefore, all current and future property owners will have the same benefit of knowing that their property's valuation for tax purposes will not increase beyond 2% per year without a change of ownership or improvement to the property. This guarantees that property taxes will be predictable and uniform for every present and future property owner in this state. This predictability also promotes neighborhood preservation, continuity, and stability in a manner which treats all property taxpayers uniformly. LIMITING TAXES BY LIMITING GROWTH OF PROPERTY TAXES TO 2% PER YEAR Sec. 5. RCW 84.55.005 and 1997 c 393 s 20 and 1997 c 3 s 201 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows: As used in this chapter: (1) "Inflation" means the percentage change in the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures for the United States as published for the most recent twelve-month period by the bureau of economic analysis of the federal department of commerce in September of the year before the taxes are payable; (2) "Limit factor" means: (a) For taxing districts with a population of less than ten thousand in the calendar year prior to the assessment year, one hundred (({- six -})) {+ two +} percent; (b) For taxing districts for which a limit factor is authorized under RCW 84.55.0101, the lesser of the limit factor under that section or one hundred (({- six -})) {+ two +} percent; (c) For all other districts, the lesser of one hundred (({- six - })) {+ two +} percent or one hundred percent plus inflation; and (3) "Regular property taxes" has the meaning given it in RCW 04.140. Sec. 6. RCW 84.55.0101 and 1997 c 3 s 204 are each amended to read as follows: Upon a finding of substantial need, the legislative authority of a taxing district other than the state may provide for the use of a limit factor under this chapter of one hundred (({- six -})) {+ two +} percent or less. In districts with legislative authorities of four members or less, two-thirds of the members must approve an ordinance or resolution under this section. In districts with more than four members, a majority plus one vote must approve an ordinance or resolution under this section. The new limit factor shall be effective for taxes collected in the following year only.

RCW 84.55.092 (Protection of future levy capacity) and 1998 c 16 s 3, 1988 c 274 s 4, & 1986 c 107 s 3 are each repealed.
