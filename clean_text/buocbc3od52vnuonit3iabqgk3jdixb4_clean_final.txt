Clay Young satisfied the debt in full by paying Pikco $4,400; Clay Young filed his Proof of Claim on September 10, 2010, claiming to be a secured creditor in the amount of $4,400; and The Debtor filed his Objection on November 11, 2010. Issue The issue, which appears to be an issue of firs t impression before this Court, is whether Clay Young’s Proof of Claim should be allowed as a secured claim. Discussion Miss. Code Ann. § 75-3-419 (Rev. 2010) govern s instruments signed for accommodation in Mississippi. Pertinent subsections of § 75-3-419 provide as follows: (a) If an instrument is issued for valu e given for the benefit of a party to the instrument (“accommodated party”) and another party to the instrument(“accommodation party”) signs the instrument for the purpose of incurring liabilityon the instrument without being a direct beneficiary of the value given for theinstrument, the instrument is signed by the accommodation party “foraccommodation.” . . . (f) An accommodation party who pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement from the accommodated party and is entitled to enforce the instrument against theaccommodated party. In proper circumst ances, an accommodation party may obtain relief that requires the accommodated party to perform its obligations on theinstrument. An accommodated party who pays the instrument has no right ofrecourse against, and is not entitled to contribution from, an accommodation party. The Mississippi Supreme Court dealt with an accommodation party’s right of subrogation in Murray v. Payne , 437 So. 2d 47 (Miss. 1983). In Murray , the appellees were sureties on a note, and as such, were accommodation parties. Id. at 52. The Mississippi Supreme Court held that, “[an of 3

accommodation party’s] right of subrogation, recognized by the above statute,2 is his equitable right to assert the rights of the creditor against the de btor. Upon payment, the [accommodation party] is said to “stand in the shoes” of the creditor.” Id. The Murray court further held that, “[n]ot only is the accommodation party en titled to sue the maker of a note to recover the amount that the accommodation party ends up paying, but he is also entitl ed to any collateral securing the note.” Id. Hence, if the original creditor is a secu red creditor, upon payment of the obligation, the accommodation party steps into the position of the original creditor as a secured creditor. In this case, the Debtor signed a note with Pikco to finance a vehicle. Clay Young signed the note as an accommodation party. When the Debtor defaulted on payments to Pikco, Clay Young paid Pikco $4,400 to satisfy the debt. Under Miss. Code Ann. § 75-3- 419 (Rev. 2010) and the reasoning in Murray , Clay Young “stands in the shoes” of Pikco as a secured creditor.3 Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds th at Clay Young, as an accommodation party to the note and having satisfied the debt, is a secure d creditor. Accordingly, the Objection should be overruled. A separate order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will be entered by the Court in accordance with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7054, 9014, and 9021. Dated this the 18th day of January, 2011. / s / Neil P. Olack NEIL P. OLACK U. S. BANKRUPTCY JUDGE 2 At the time the Murray opinion was written in 1983, the applicable statute was Miss. Code Ann. § 75-3-415 (Supp. 1982). The applicable statute is now Miss. Code Ann. § 75-3-419 (Rev. 2010) (giving the accommodation party additional rights). 3 Since no other issue was raised as to Clay Young’s secured claim, and since this chapter 13 plan proposes to pay all creditors 100%, the Court declines to opine as to the extent to whichClay Young’s claim is secured. of 3
