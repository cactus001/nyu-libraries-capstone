B a c k g r o u n d In September 2020, the Humanitarian Data and Trust Initiative (HDTI) initiated a dialogue 1 process related to responsible data sharing between humanitarian organizations and donors. The goal was to examine and build a common understanding around the objectives, risks and constraints related to this type of data sharing in humanitarian action in order to develop a framework for collective action in this area. The dialogue consisted of two meetings convened through Wilton Park (in September 2020 2 3 and in September 2021 ), two pieces of independent research (conducted by the Global Public 4 Policy Institute and the University of Manchester in 2020-2021), and a series of stakeholder 5 6 consultations. This framework is the primary output of this process. I I . R a t i o n a l e a n d C o n t e x t Humanitarian organizations increasingly recognize incentives to collect and share disaggregated data from their operations for various purposes such as improved coordination, more efficient service provision, accountability and transparency. At the same time, they have to ensure that data is exclusively used for humanitarian purposes and does not cause harm to vulnerable populations. This requires collective action to mitigate the risks related to sharing disaggregated data in and about humanitarian contexts. These risks include the risk of re-identification, violations of the rights to privacy and data protection, data breaches, and the potential use of data outside of humanitarian purposes. 6 Fast, Larissa.

Donors have an important role in the humanitarian data ecosystem, both as drivers of increased data collection and analysis, and as direct users of data. In recent years, donors have begun to increasingly request various forms of disaggregated data, such as household-level survey results and data about the delivery of assistance disaggregated by demographics, geographical location and/or group dimensions (e.g. ethnicity, protection status, etc.). Concerns around requests for such data have led humanitarian organizations and donors to develop new practices and frameworks that place more emphasis on data responsibility: the safe, ethical and effective management of data. Data responsibility requires humanitarian organizations and donors to take actions that help minimize risks and maximize benefits of data. This is particularly challenging in cases where donors request personal and non-personal sensitive data. This includes, for example, requests for personal data related to the screening of aid recipients and requests for non-personal sensitive data for reporting on the delivery of different forms of aid. Humanitarian actors and donors recognize the risks and benefits associated with sharing such data, but the sector has yet to establish a common understanding of how to balance these risks and benefits effectively in the context of data sharing between humanitarians and donors. This framework is designed to help advance data responsibility in this area. I I I . T h e F r a m e w o r k S c o p e The framework applies to situations where humanitarian organizations share disaggregated data with donors. Disaggregated data refers to data that is broken down by one or more sub-categories; e.g. sex, age, disability, location, etc. The framework covers personal and 7 non-personal sensitive data generated through or related to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. O b j e c t i v e s This framework is designed to reinforce the overarching commitment to ‘do no harm’, while minimizing the risks and maximizing the benefits of data in humanitarian action. It also aims to support collective action for more responsible data sharing practices between humanitarian organizations and donors. Individual entities are encouraged to adapt this framework to their own institutional context, including through relevant guidelines, procedures, templates and tools for data sharing where appropriate. Adaptation and adoption of the framework should align with different donors’ and humanitarian organizations’ respective mandates, relevant legal, policy and regulatory frameworks, and the decisions of governing bodies. 7Al i s to fd e f i n i t i o n sf o rt h ei n t e r p r e t a t i o no ft h i sf r a m e w o r kc a nb ef o u n di nA n n e xA . 2

Donors should request data from humanitarian organizations in ways that put the rights and needs of affected populations at the center. b . Humanitarian organizations should ensure that data sharing processes are designed and implemented in ways that put the rights and needs of affected populations at the center throughout the data lifecycle. c . Humanitarian organizations should ensure the possibility for the affected population to exercise their personal data protection rights, including the right to information, the right to access, the right to correction and the right to erasure. d . Humanitarian organizations should inform affected people about the planned sharing of their data and ensure that affected people understand the full data lifecycle’ (e.g., which entities will have access to the data at different stages and for what purpose). e . Humanitarian organizations should ensure, to the greatest possible extent, adequate involvement of affected people in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of data management activities. 2 .

c . Humanitarian organizations should document all requests for data and ensure consistency in responding to these requests over time. d . Donors should avoid making ad hoc requests for data that falls outside the terms of established agreements and/or in addition to what is required to meet the purpose(s) for data sharing as originally specified and agreed. Such requests should always be made in writing and should specify which data is required, the format desired, the intended use of the data, and the purposes of data sharing in a given context. 3 .

Donors should clearly articulate their data requirements at the outset of a collaboration, so that responsible data sharing practices can be agreed and reflected in the grant agreement (and related documents). This includes specifying the ways in which data should be handled by all parties involved across the data lifecycle in-line with sector-wide standards. b . Donors should monitor how these requirements are implemented in different response environments as part of existing compliance and/or quality assurance processes and offer support to their staff to foster consistent adherence to agreed requirements over time. c . Humanitarian organizations and donors should include clear terms for responsible data sharing when negotiating relevant contracts and/or agreements, including with third parties. This includes defining responsibilities for responsible 12 data sharing throughout the data lifecycle and considerations regarding data sensitivity, data security, and data retention and destruction, among others. The terms should also account for context-specific policy, legal and regulatory frameworks, as well as common protocols for responsible data sharing within the humanitarian community (e.g. system-wide information sharing protocols). 4 .

Humanitarian organizations and donors should conduct a data impact assessment for different data sharing activities, accounting to context-specific factors and dynamics that may influence the likelihood or severity of a risk related to data sharing. This can be done jointly or by each collaborating organization. b . Humanitarian organizations and donors should establish mitigation measures to address potential risks related to data sharing, notably for the affected populations and individuals or groups at risk. c . Humanitarian organizations and donors should monitor the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures throughout the course of the data sharing activity. 12 This includes, i n t e r a l i a , Third Party Monitors (TPMs), Financial Service Providers (FSPs), and individual and institutional consultants involved in data management. 4

A n n e x A : D e f i n i t i o n s For the purposes of this framework, the following definitions apply: - “ D a t a i m p a c t a s s e s s m e n t ” is a generic term that refers to multiple types of assessments. This includes Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), the established tool and process in data protection law that should be used (specifically) to assess personal data protection risks. Many organizations have specific policies, requirements and guidelines for how DIAs should be conducted. - “ D a t a M a n a g e m e n t ” refers to the design of data management activities and subsequent collection or receipt, storage, processing, analysis, sharing, use, and retention and destruction of data and information by humanitarian actors. Such activities occur as part of humanitarian action throughout the planning and response cycle across clusters/sectors and include, but are not limited to, situational analysis, needs assessments, population data management, registration and enrollment, case management, communicating with affected populations, protection monitoring, and response monitoring and evaluation. - “ D a t a R e s p o n s i b i l i t y ’ ’ refers to the safe, ethical and effective management of personal and non-personal data in humanitarian action. - “ D a t a S h a r i n g ” includes all acts that make data accessible on paper, via electronic means or the internet, or through other methods to a recipient : a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data is disclosed. - “ D i s a g g r e g a t e d d a t a ” refers to data that is broken down by one or more sub-categories; e.g. sex, age, disability, location, etc. The framework includes personal and non-personal sensitive data generated through or related to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. - “ D o n o r s ” refers to entities who are major contributors to international and humanitarian organizations. This may include states, private foundations, and other entities that provide financial resources to support the delivery of humanitarian assistance. - “ H u m a n i t a r i a n O r g a n i z a t i o n s ” refers to entities with a mission to alleviate human suffering and support affected populations in situations of conflict, natural disaster or socio-economic hardship . - “ P e r s o n a l D a t a ” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. - “ S e n s i t i v e n o n - p e r s o n a l d a t a ” means information whose unauthorized disclosure may cause very serious harm to humanitarian organizations’ or donors’ operations, reputation, assets, staff, and interlocutors, or is very likely to result in regulatory action(s). Such information may also be defined as sensitive due to its nature, regardless of the harm its unauthorized disclosure would cause to humanitarian organizations’ or donors’. - “ T h i r d p a r t y ” means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorized to process personal data. 6
