ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES DIVISION OF FORESTRY ALASKA INCIDENT BUSINESS MANAGEMENT HANDBOOK 2009 Chapter 1 – Emergency Firefighter Hiring 1 EMERGENCY FIREFIGHTER HIRING Emergency Firefighters (EFF) must be 18 years of age to be eligible for employment. Individuals can receive crew tr aining at age 16 or older. The Division of Forestry (DOF) employs thr ee categories of Emergency Firefighters (EFF) in its wildland fire program: • Type II EFF crews • Non-crew EFF Type II EFF crews are hired, managed, and paid by the State of Alaska or BLM under the guidelines set forth in the Alaska Intera gency Emergency Firefighter Type II Crew Management Guide. The list of Designated Cr ews is found on page 22 & 23 and the key to acronyms for this list are on page 24. Access to Firearms • All non-crew EFF being considered for work need to submit an EFF Application annually so hiring personnel can tell if further action is warranted based on answers provided. • All incumbents of positions in the warehouse or as drivers need to annually submit the Qualification Inquiry – Firearm Possession form. See pages 28 & 29. Note: Firearms Inquiry Forms should be accompan ied by the definition of “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence”, Select Portions of Ti tle 18 United States Code – page 30. Hours of Work EFF are hired as temporary emergency workers in response to hazardous wildfire situations. The State does not guarantee the length of empl oyment, working schedules, or number of hours per day. EFF crews will be paid for no le ss than eight hours of work per day except for the first and last day of an assignment, mandator y day off, or when being terminated. Non-crew EFF have no similar guarantee. Timesheets and Pay - See Incident Payroll, Chapter 2. EFF Employment Information General information about the EFF program, as well as an information packet and application for non-crew positions, can be found at http://forestry.ala ska.gov/employ.htm .

ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES DIVISION OF FORESTRY ALASKA INCIDENT BUSINESS MANAGEMENT HANDBOOK 2009 Chapter 1 – Emergency Firefighter Hiring 2 Alaska Job Center Different Alaska Job Center O ffices throughout the state offer va rying levels of assistance. DOF is responsible for coordinating with local Job Center offices to develop procedures for referring and recruiting applicants during fire season for their Area. Non-crew EFF hires must be made through Alaska Job Center whenever possible. Area or Regional offices can hire from applications previously collected by Job Center and forwarded to Forestry in lieu of contacting Job Center first each time. All DOF offices will use a standardized employment application (BLM or DNR Emergency Firefighter or Incident Support Worker form, see page 8). Previously employed EFF recommended for rehi re with acceptable pe rformance ratings may either be name requested from Alaska Job Center or contact ed directly because of fire operational needs. Some Alaska Job Center offices only accep t applications for a specific time period. Others do so constantly. Employment-related telephone inquiries from perspective non-crew EFF should be referred to the nearest Alaska Job Center Office provided the Job Center is accepting applications. If not, an application can be filled out and kept on file in case hiring needs occur. If completed Job Center applications aren’t at hand, regular job orders can be placed by phone for EFF, but minimum job qualifications and titles must be given to Alaska Job Center in order for them to provide qualified applicants. The hiring supervisor will notify Alaska Job Center when a referral is hired from their list of applicants. Alternate Hiring Procedures Applications will be available at each DOF o ffice and Alaska Job Cent er. Nothing in this procedure prohibits hiring of additional worker s when Alaska Job Center is unavailable such as weekends, holidays, or after hours. To support equitable hiring practices, documentation of all attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, to contact applicants by phone are recorded on their application or on a contact log, noting date, time of call, and the name of the pers on making the call. Logs and applications will be kept on file for 2 years by the Area or Regional Admin. Requesting a Non-crew EFF All EFF hires will be initiated and documented on a Resource Order. Requests for non-crew EFF will be made from the appropriate choice from the List of Approved EFF Classifications (p age 7) on a General Message Form to the State Logistics Center or respective Area Di spatch Office for processing with the following information:

Felony and Misdemeanor Convictions for Non-crew EFF When applications reveal a misdemeanor convic tion within the preceding five years, or a felony conviction regardless of the date it o ccurred (2 AAC 07.091), a hiring supervisor or manager may not make a job offer withou t DOA Human Resources’ review of the conviction information and duties of the position. A hiring supervisor or manager who has knowledge of a conviction will re port the information to Human Resources at the time of EFF hiring need. Classification of EFF Anyone not fully qualified is considered a trai nee, and will be paid one level lower than a fully ICS-qualified individual. Applicants will be hired and paid at the a ppropriate EFF classification according to the current EFF List of Approve d Classifications (page 7). Hiring offices will work with their Regional Admin Officers to determine a ppropriate pay rate of EFF positions not shown on the List of Approved EFF Cla ssifications. If the work assignment changes, the worker’s classification and pay will be appropriately changed to reflect the new duties. Any incidental changes in assignment that cause a rate change must be documented on the crew time report. Permanent or long term changes require a new resource order. At no time will an EFF, regardless of length of service or qualifications, be paid at a higher rate than the assigned work requires .
