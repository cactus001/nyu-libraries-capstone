In the last two decades, the American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut population grew rapidly. In 1970, this population num- bered 827,000; it reached 4 million in 1980 and nearly 2 million in 1990. The 1990 census counted 1,878,285 American Indians, 57,152 Eskimos, and 23,797 Aleuts.Census Bureau estimates and projections suggest that on July 1, 1994, the American In- dian, Eskimo, and Aleut popu- lation numbered 2.2 million, and that it will reach 4.3 million and just over 1 percent of the population by 2050. The 72 percent increase between the 1970 and 1980 censuses and the 38 percent increase between the 1980 and 1990 censuses cannot be attributed only to natural increase. Other factors that may have contributed to the higher count of American In- dians 1 include improvements in the question on race; improvements in the way the Census Bureau counted 1In the text, American Indian represents American Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts.people on reservations, on trust lands, and in Alaska Native villages; continued use of self-identification to obtain information on race; a greater propensity in 1990 than in ear- lier censuses for individuals (especially those of mixed In- dian and non-Indian parent- age) to report themselves as American Indian; and im- proved outreach programs and promotion campaigns. Nearly one-half of the American Indian population lives west of the Mississippi River. Nearly one-half of the Ameri- can Indian population lived in the West in 1990, 29 percent in the South, 17 percent in the Midwest, and 6 percent in the Northeast. Between 1980 and 1990, the proportion of Ameri- can Indians increased notice- ably only in the South, from 26 to 29 percent. In 1990, four States had an American In- dian population over 100,000 — Oklahoma, California, Ari- zona, and New Mexico. The population in these four States comprised 42 percent of the total U.S. American Indian population. Oklahoma was the State with the largest American Indian population in 1990, climbing from second in 1980. Between 1980 and 1990, California dropped from first to second place, and Arizona and New Mexico stayed at third and fourth place, respectively. The American Indian population is young. Thirty-nine percent of the American Indian populationwas under 20 years old in1990, compared with 29 per-cent of the Nation’s total popu-lation. The median age in1990 of the American Indian population was 26 years, con- siderably younger than theU.S. median age of 33 years.The comparable median agesin 1980 were 23 years and 30 years, respectively. TheAmerican Indian population is younger in part because of higher fertility rates than the total population. Nearly two-thirds of American Indian families aremarried-coupled families. About 6 in 10 of the Nation’s 442,000 American Indian families were married-couple families in 1990, compared with about 8 in 10 of the Nation’s 64.5 million families.The proportion of American Indian husband and wife

Consistent with the national trend, the proportion of American Indian families maintained by a female householder with no husband present increased during the last decade and reached 27 percent in 1990. This propor- tion was considerably larger than the national figure of 17 percent. The educational attainment levels of American Indianshas improved significantly. In 1990, 66 percent of the 1,080,000 American Indians 25 years old and over werehigh school graduates or high- er, compared with only 56 per- cent in 1980. Despite the advances, the 1990 proportion was still below that for the total population (75 percent). American Indians were also less likely than the entire U.S. population to have completed a bachelor’s degree or higher. About 9 percent of American Indians completed a bache- lor’s degree or higher in 1990, compared with 8 percent in 1980 — still lower than the 20 percent for the total population in 1990. American Indian family incomes were low. The median family income in 1989 of all American Indian families declined from its 1979 level (1989 dollars) by 5 per- cent. In 1990, the median family income of American Indians was $21,750, about 62 percent of the $35,225 median for all families. The median income of American Indian married-couple families was $28,287 or 71 percent of the $39,584 median for all married-couple families. The median income for American Indian families maintained by a female householder with no husband present was $10,742, about 62 percent of the $17,414 median for all families maintained by women with no husband present. More American Indian families and persons were in poverty, compared with all families and persons. Between 1979 and 1989, the poverty rate increased for both American Indian families and persons. 2 Twenty-seven percent of American Indian families were poor in 1989, compared with 24 percent in This compared with a poverty rate of 10 percent for all families in both 1989 and In 1989, 50 percent of American Indian families maintained by females with no husband present were poor, compared with 31 per- cent of all families maintained by women with no husband present. The 1980 and 1990 censuses show that the poverty rate for American Indians has remained considerably higher than that of the total popula- tion. In 1989, 31 percent of American Indian persons lived below the poverty level, up from 27 percent in 1979. Thenational poverty rate was 2In 1989, the poverty threshold for a family of four was $12,674; unchanged from 1979 (in 1989 dollars).about 13 percent in 1989 and 12 percent in 1979. The number of American Indians living on reservations and trust lands varied considerably. Of the 314 reservations and trust lands identified for the 1990 census, only the Navajo Reservation and Trust Lands located in Arizona, New Mexi- co, and Utah had more than 100,000 American Indians — 143,405 lived there. An additional nine reservations had more than 7,000 Ameri- can Indians in 1990: Pine Ridge, NE-SD (11,182); Fort Apache, AZ (9,825); Gila Riv- er, AZ (9,116); Papago, AZ (8,480); Rosebud, SD (8,043); San Carlos, AZ (7,110); Zuni Pueblo, AZ-NM (7,073); Hopi, AZ (7,061); and Blackfeet, MT (7,025). The 218,320 Ameri- can Indians living on these 10 reservations and trust lands accounted for about half of all American Indians living on reservations and trust lands. Educational levels of American Indians differ among the reservations and trust lands. Fifty-four percent of American Indians 25 years old and over living on all reservations andtrust lands were high school graduates or more. Among the 10 largest reservations and trust lands, this proportion ranged considerably. Black- feet (66 percent) and Hopi (63 percent) had similar proportions of high school graduates. Gila River, at about 37 percent, had the lowest proportion who had at least graduated from high school, followed by Navajo with 41 percent. American Indians on reservations and trust landshad low per capita incomes. The per capita income in 1989 was about $4,478 for Ameri- can Indians residing on all reservations and trust lands, compared with $8,328 for all American Indians. The per capita income of American In- dians on the 10 largest reser- vations ranged from about $3,100 on the Papago and Pine Ridge Reservations to over $4,500 on the Blackfeet ($4,718) and Hopi ($4,566) Reservations. NOTE: The most recent data for the American Indian popu- lation are from the 1990 cen- sus. The Current Population Survey is not sufficiently large to provide reliable estimates for this population.
