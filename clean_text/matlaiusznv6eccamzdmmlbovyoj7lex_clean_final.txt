Line 18. Penalty. You must file and pay by the due date listed on the tax return. If you don't, the following penalties apply: If you file on time but your payment is late, the penalty is 0.5% of the tax due (see line 17) for each late month. This penalty begins the first day you are late and continues until you pay the tax. If you file late, the penalty is 5% of the tax due (see line 17) for each late month. This penalty begins the first day you are late and continues until you file your return or pay the tax. If you file late and don't pay the tax when you file, there is an additional late penalty of 0.5% of the tax due (see line 17) for each late month.
