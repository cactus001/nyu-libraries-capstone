The purpose of this incentive is to retain highly qualified employees. The cost will be $84,659.00 for the staff excluding district personnel. The remaining $95,809.00 will be used to hire two teachers for the 2011-2012 school year for the purpose of double blocking Math and Literacy at the Middle School. Goals: College and Career Ready Preparation Teachers Effectiveness and Equitable Distribution Goal Justification: Cedarville is a small rural school located 9 miles north of a large school district that offers higher pay schedule. The jobs fund money incentive of $600.00 will give the district a chance to compensate the staff for their dedication and to retain a highly qualified staff. Cedarville Middle School has just added 6 classrooms and a new P.E. facility. The addition of classrooms will provide the needed classrooms to double block Math and Literacy. The progress monitoring of the Middle School students indicates the need for additional instruction time in Math and Literacy. The students will be tested 3 times a year using the MAP test to monitor the effectiveness of the double blocking. The results will be used to monitor the continuation of double blocking. The information obtained from the monitoring of the double block data will be used to guide the High School schedule needs. This will help the district offer classes to better prepare our students for college and careers.
