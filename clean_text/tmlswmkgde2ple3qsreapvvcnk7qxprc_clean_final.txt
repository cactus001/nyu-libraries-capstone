44-21-01-06-0003 March 19, 2004 Warwick Valley Middle School 3 The New York State School Report Card is an important part of the Board of Regents effort to raise learning standards for all students. It provides information to the public on student performance and other measures of school and dist rict performance. Know ledge gained from the school report card on a sc hool’s strengths and weaknesses can be used to improve instruction and services to students. The New York State School Report Card consists of three parts: the Overview of School Performance in English Language Ar ts, Mathematics, and Science and Analysis of Student Subgroup Performance, the Comprehensive Information Report, and the School Accountability Report . The Overview and Analysis presents performance data on measures required by the federal No Child Left Behind Act: English, mathematics, science, and graduation rate. Performance data on other State assessments can be found in the Comprehensive Information Report . The School Accountability Report provides information as to whether a school is making adequate progress toward enab ling all students to achieve proficiency in English and mathematics. State assessments are designed to help en sure that all students reach high learning standards. They show whether students are getting the foundation know ledge they need to succeed at the elementary, middle, and commen cement levels and beyond. The State requires that students who are not making appropriate pr ogress toward the standards receive academic intervention services. In the Overview , performance on the elementary- and middle-level assessments in English language arts and mathem atics and on the middle-level science test is reported in terms of mean scores and the percentage of students sc oring at each of the four levels. These levels indicate performance on the standards from se riously deficient to advanced proficiency. Performance on the elementary-level science test is reported in terms of mean scores and the percentage of students making a ppropriate progress. Regents examination scores are reported in four score ranges. Scores of 65 to 100 are passing; scores of 55 to 64 earn credit toward a local diploma (with the approval of the local board of education). Though each elementary- and middle-level assessment is administered to st udents in a specific gr ade, secondary-level assessments are taken by students when they comp lete the coursework for the core curriculum. Therefore, the performance of students at the se condary level is measured for a student cohort rather than a group of students at a particular grade level. Students are grouped in cohorts according to the year in which they first entered grade 9. The assessment data in the Overview and Analysis are for all tested students in the school, including general-education students a nd students with disabilities. In the Overview , each school’s performance is compared with that of school s similar in grade level, district resources, and student needs as indicated by income and limited English proficiency (LEP) status. Each district’s performance is compared w ith that of all public schools statewide. In the Analysis , performance is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, di sability status, gender, LEP status, income level, and migrant status. Explanations of terms referred to or symbols used in this part of the school report card may be found in the glossary on the last page. Further information on th e school report card may be found in the guide, Understanding Your School Report Card: February 2004 , available on the Information and Reporting Services Web site at www.emsc.nysed.gov/irts.

44-21-01-06-0003 March 19, 2004 Warwick Valley Middle School 8Analysis of Student Subgroup Performance Historically, on State assessments the average performance of Black, Hispanic, and Native American students has been lower than that of White and Asian students. Similarly, students from low- income families have not performed as well as those fr om higher income families. A high priority of the Board of Regents is to eliminate these gaps in student performance. In addition, Title I of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act includes explicit requirements “to ensure that students served by Title I are given the same opportunity to achieve to high standards and are held to the same high expectations as all students in each State.” This section of the school report card provides performance data for two years by racial/ethnic group, disability status, gender, English proficiency status, income level, and migrant status. The purpose of the student subgroup analyses is to deter mine if students who perform below the standards in any school tend to fall into particular groups, such as minority students, limited English proficient students, or economically disadvantaged students. If thes e analyses provide evidence that students in one of the groups achieve at a lower level than other students, the school and community should examine the reasons for this lower performance and make necessary changes in curriculum, instruction, and student support services to remedy these performance gaps. If your school did not report data for the 2002-03 school year for a subject and grade, a table showing data for subgroups in that subject and grade will not be included in the Analysis .

44-21-01-06-0003 March 19, 2004 Warwick Valley Middle School 12Glossary Accountability Cohort: An accountability cohort is all students, regardless of grade status, who were enrolled in school on BEDS day two years after the year in which they entered grade 9, or, in the case of ungraded students with disabilities, the year in which they reached their seventeenth birthday. (For example, the 1998 accountability cohort consists of all students who first entered grade 9 in the fall of 1998 who were enrolled on October 4, 2000). Certain students with severe disabilities, new immigrants, and students who transfer to programs leading to a high school diploma or high school equivalency diploma are not included in the school accountability cohort. Cohort is defined in Section 100.2 (p) (8) of the Commissioner’s Regulations. Component Retests: Component retests were offered in Regents English and Mathematics A to graduating seniors who were at risk of not meeting the State learning standards. Component retesting is the process by which a student who has failed a Regents examination in English or Mathematics A twice is retested only on the areas of the learning standards in which the student has been proven deficient. Component retesting eliminates the need for the student to retake the full Regents examination multiple times. Students who earn credit through component retesting are counted as if they scored in the 55–64 range or in the 65–84 range, as determined by the results of the component retest. Counts of Students Tested: “Counts of Students Tested” includes only students who completed sufficient test questions to receive a score. Graduation-Rate Cohort: Graduation-rate cohort for each year includes all students in the accountability cohort in the previous year plus all students excluded from that accountability cohort solely because they transferred to a general education development (GED) program. Limited English Proficient (LEP) Students: Schools provide special English instruction to students for whom English is a second language so they can participate effectively in the academic program. In 2002–03 and in previous years, students were considered LEP if, by reason of foreign birth or ancestry, they spoke a language other than English and (1) either understood and spoke little or no English or (2) scored at or below the 40 th percentile on an English language assessment instrument. The United States Department of Education has approved the use of the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) as the required measure of language arts proficiency for LEP students in grades 4 and 8 who have attended school in the United States (not including Puerto Rico) for fewer than three consecutive years and for LEP students who have attended for four or five years and have received an exemption from the general assessment requirement. New York State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA): The district Committee on Special Education designates students with severe disabilities who meet criteria estab lished in Commissioner’s Regulations to take the New York State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA). Similar Schools: Similar schools are schools that are grouped by common district and student demographic characteristics, including grade range of students served by the school, school district financial resources, and needs of the school student population. More information about similar school groups may be found on the Web at http://www.emsc.nysed.gov/repcrd2002/similar.html. Student Confidentiality/Suppressed Data (# and s): To ensure student confidentiality, the Department does not publish data for groups with fewer than five students or data that would allow readers to easily determine the performance of a group with fewer than five students. In the Overview, the pound character (#) appears when fewer than five students in a group were tested. In the Analysis , when fewer than five students in a group (e.g., Hispanic) were tested, percentages of tested students scoring at various levels are suppressed for that group and the next smallest group. Suppressed data are indicated with an (s). However, the performance of tested students in these groups is aggregated and shown in the Small Group Total row. Validity and Reliability of Small Group Data: It is important that programmatic decisions are based on valid and reliable data. Data for fewer than 30 students in a group may be neither valid nor reliable. If a school does not have 30 students in a grade or a subgroup in a given year, the school should evaluate results for students in this group over a period of years to make programmatic decisions.
