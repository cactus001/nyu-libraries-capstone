Chapter 10 Stable Isotopes of Transition and Post-Transition Metals as Tracers in Environmental Studies Thomas D. Bullen Abstract The transition and post-transition metals, which include the elements in Groups 3–12 of the Periodic Table, have a broad range of geological and biological roles as well as industrial applications and thus are widespread in the environment. Interdiscip- linary research over the past decade has resulted in a broad understanding of the isotope systematics of this important group of elements and revealed largely unexpected variability in isotope composition for natural materials. Signiﬁcant kinetic and equilibrium isotope fractionation has been observed for redox sen- sitive metals such as iron, chromium, copper, molyb- denum and mercury, and for metals that are not redox sensitive in nature such as cadmium and zinc. In the environmental sciences, the isotopes are increasingly being used to understand important issues such as tracing of metal contaminant sources and fates, unra- veling metal redox cycles, deciphering metal nutrient pathways and cycles, and developing isotope biosigna- tures that can indicate the role of biological activity in ancient and modern planetary systems. 1 Introduction The transition metals form a geochemically and isoto- pically complex and interesting group of elements clustered in the center of the periodic table. The term transition metal , according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), refers to an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete dsub-shell. As shown in Fig. 10.1, according to this deﬁnition transition metals occur in Groups 1B and 3B-8B of the periodic table, and the transition metals across the periodic table have progressively increasing d-shell electron occupancy up to a maximum of 9. A characteristic of transition metals is that they gener- ally exhibit two or more oxidation states, which as a consequence often leads to differences in the stable isotope composition of the chemical compounds and aqueous species they form. Transition metals for which signiﬁcant variation of stable isotope com- position in natural materials has been demonstrated include chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo) and silver (Ag). The above deﬁnition of transition metal speciﬁ- cally excludes the Group 2B elements zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), which are often referred to as post-transition metals . These metals have the d shell ﬁlled and thus generally occur as cations only in the þ2 oxidation state. However, it is useful to include the post-transition metals in any discussion of transition metals, as they provide inter- esting similarities and contrasts in chemical behavior, are subject to change in redox state either naturally (e.g. Hg) or under anthropogenic inﬂuence (e.g. Zn, Cd) and display signiﬁcant variation of stable isotope composition in natural materials. Given this broad perspective, a description of the isotope systematics of the transition and post-transition metals is given here, including general isotopic distri- bution, examples of processes leading to stable isotope fractionation, and chemical properties pertinent to the discussion of stable isotope variability observed in natural materials. Rather than providing a comprehen- sive treatment of these issues, the intent here is to provide a general understanding of how the transition metal stable isotopes behave in Earth’s hydrosphereT.D.

and atmosphere that are the venue of environmental research. Familiarity with the material in this section will help readers who are not well versed in stable isotope geochemistry to better appreciate the speciﬁc applications discussed in the later part of the chapter. 1.1 Chromium (Cr) Chromium is an important trace element, particularly in ultramaﬁc and maﬁc rock minerals, and is a major element in several minerals such as chromite (FeCr 2O4) of the spinel group, uvarovite (Ca 3Cr2(SiO 4)3of the garnet group, and crocoite (PbCrO 4). Chromium has numerous industrial applications, including use in electroplating, in leather tanning, as pigment in paint, and as an anticorrosion agent. Chromium is stable at the Earth’s surface in two oxidation states: Cr6+ (Cr(VI)), commonly referred to as hexavalent Cr, and Cr3+(Cr(III)), commonly referred to as trivalent Cr. Cr(VI) is a strong oxidant, and occurs mainly as the toxic, water-soluble oxyanions chromate (CrO 42-) and bichromate (HCr 2O71-). Cr(III) is nontoxic and is insoluble in water. Chromium has four stable isotopes:50Cr (4.35%), 52Cr (83.79%),53Cr (9.50%) and54Cr (2.37%); note that for Cr and other elements discussed below that relative percentages of the isotopes are the values recommended by IUPAC to represent average terres- trial abundances. Igneous rocks have a very restricted range of53Cr/52Cr which on average is about 0.12 ‰ (parts per thousand) less than that of NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) 979 Cr metal (Schoenberg et al. 2008). Presently the measured range of53Cr/52Cr in natural materials is ~6 ‰, essen- tially reﬂecting the range measured for naturally occu- rring Cr(VI) in groundwater (Izbicki et al. 2008). Both inorganic and microbially mediated reduction of Cr (VI) to Cr(III) have been shown to result in isotope fractionation, with breakage of the strong Cr-O bond in chromate and bichromate appearing to be the rate limiting step (Ellis et al. 2002; Sikora et al. 2008). During reduction of Cr(VI), the product Cr(III) formed at any step of the process is 3–4 ‰lighter than co- existing remnant Cr(VI). The fact that the oxidized species, Cr(VI), is heavier than the reduced species, Cr(III), is consistent with observations for other redox- sensitive elements such as selenium (Johnson et al.2000; Johnson 2011) and mercury (Bergquist and Blum 2009; Blum 2011). While oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) is also likely to cause stable isotope fraction- ation (Schauble 2004), this phenomenon has yet to be rigorously demonstrated. Sorption of chromate and bichromate on Fe- and Al-oxyhydroxides has only a negligible instantaneous effect on the distribution of Cr isotopes, with preferential partitioning of light Cr iso- topes onto sorption sites. Sorption effects may be mag- niﬁed at reaction fronts such as the leading edge of a Cr contaminant plume in groundwater (Ellis et al. 2004). 1.2 Iron (Fe) Iron is the most abundant element on Earth and the fourth most abundant element in the Earth’s crust. Iron is the most widely used metal in industry, and thus is pervasive in the environment. Iron is stable at the Earth’s surface in two oxidation states: Fe2+(Fe(II)), commonly referred to as ferrous Fe, and Fe3+(Fe(III)), commonly referred to as ferric Fe. Fe(II) is a strong reductant, is water-soluble, and is an important con- stituent of Fe minerals formed under reducing condi- tions (e.g. magnetite, siderite, pyrite). Fe(III) is only sparingly water-soluble and is an important constitu- ent of Fe minerals formed under oxidizing conditions (e.g. ferrihydrite, goethite, hematite). Iron metal has a wide variety of applications in metallurgy such as construction of automobiles and ships, structural com- ponents of buildings, and machinery in general. Iron compounds such as Fe(III)-chloride and Fe(II)-sulfate are likewise widely used in industry for a variety of purposes. Iron plays an important role in biology and is an essential nutrient for nearly all living organisms. For example, Fe combines with oxygen to form hemo- globin and myoglobin, the two main oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates. Iron can serve as both electron donor and electron acceptor for a wide range of micro- organisms, and thus Fe redox reactions have the poten- tial to support substantial microbial populations in soil and sedimentary environments (Weber et al. 2006). Iron has been viewed as a limiting nutrient for phyto- plankton growth in the oceans (Martin and Fitzwater 1988). Iron transformations and cycling processes are critical determinants of plant, forest and agricultural ecosystem function. Iron itself is generally non-toxic, but dissolved Fe(II) does impart an unpleasant taste to178 T.D. Bullen

water and Fe(III) staining of plumbing ﬁxtures can be a nuisance. Like Cr, Fe has four stable isotopes:54Fe (5.58%), 56Fe (91.95%),57Fe (2.18%) and58Fe (0.30%). Igne- ous rocks have a very restricted range of56Fe/54Fe. Presently the measured range of56Fe/54Fe in natural materials is ~5 ‰, with pyrites from Precambrian black shales spanning this range ( /C03.6 to +1.2 ‰rela- tive to igneous rocks; Severmann and Anbar 2009). Both inorganic and microbially-mediated oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) and microbial reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) have been shown to result in stable isotope fractionation (Bullen et al. 2001; Balci et al. 2006; Beard et al. 1999). Perhaps most important in this regard is the experimentally and theoretically well- established isotope exchange equilibrium between Fe (II)- and Fe(III)-hexaquo complexes of ~3 ‰(Johnson et al. 2002; Anbar et al. 2005), in which the oxidized species, Fe(III), is heavier than the reduced species, Fe(II), as is the case for Cr. In addition, an important role for sorption of Fe onto mineral surfaces has been recognized, with heavy Fe species observed to popu- late the sorption sites after equilibrium is attained (Beard et al. 2010). 1.3 Nickel (Ni) Nickel is used in many industrial and consumer products, including stainless steel and other metal alloys, coins, rechargeable batteries, and electroplat- ing. Nickel is an important trace element in ultramaﬁc and maﬁc rocks. Nickel is stable at the Earth’s surface in three oxidation states: primarily as Ni2+(Ni(II)), but also as Ni1+(Ni(I)) and Ni3+(Ni(III)). Nickel is an important enzyme cofactor, for example in urease, which assists in the hydrolysis of urea. Nickel has ﬁve stable isotopes:58Ni (68.1%),60Ni (26.2%),61Ni (1.1%),62Ni (3.6%) and64Ni (0.9%). In a recent study of Ni stable isotope variations related to methanogenesis, Cameron et al. (2009) found that methanogens cultured in the laboratory preferentially assimilated light Ni from the media, leaving the resi- due enriched in heavy Ni isotopes. Fractionation of as much as 1.6 ‰for60Ni/58Ni was observed. In contrast, little variability was observed among mete- orites, basalts and continental sediments, suggestinga lithologic baseline for comparison of this potential biomarker of methanogenesis. 1.4 Copper (Cu) Copper has a wide range of industrial applications, including use for electrical wires, in metal alloys, in boat paint to prevent biologic fouling, in water and gas supply pipes, and in coins. Copper is stable at the Earth’s surface in two oxidation states: Cu1+(Cu(I)), which is the common form in sulﬁde minerals such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), chalcocite (Cu 2S), and enargite (Cu 3AsS 4); and Cu2+(Cu(II)), which is the common form in aqueous solution. Copper can be toxic to animals, due in large part to its ability to accept and donate single electrons readily as it changes between oxidation states. This is thought to catalyze the production of reactive radical ions leading to the condition known as oxidative stress. Cu has two stable isotopes:63Cu (69.17%) and 65Cu (30.83%). In natural materials, the measured range of65Cu/63Cu is approximately 9 ‰for solid samples and 3 ‰for water samples (Larson et al. 2003; Borrok et al. 2008). In one study of possible Cu stable isotope fractionation processes, abiotic oxidative dissolution of Cu-bearing sulﬁde minerals resulted in the product aqueous Cu(II) being ~1.4 ‰ heavier in terms of the65Cu/63Cu ratio than Cu in chalcopyrite and ~3.0 ‰heavier than Cu in chalcocite. Involving the microbe Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans in the dissolution process reduced the fractionation observed in both cases (Mathur et al. 2005). Copper isotopes are beginning to provide important new insights into how Cu behaves in Earth’s rivers and oceans, as well as how the isotopes may be fractio- nated. Vance et al. (2008) reported65Cu/63Cu ratios for riverine water, estuarine water and particulates, and open ocean water samples. They observed that dissolved Cu in rivers had65Cu/63Cu of from 0.02 to 45‰greater than that of the NIST 976 Cu standard, and for the most part greater than that of Cu in crustal rocks (+0.16 ‰relative to NIST 976). In the estuarine samples,65Cu/63Cu of dissolved Cu was 0.8–1.5 ‰ greater than that of Cu associated with particulate material. Vance et al. (2008) interpreted this isotopic contrast to reﬂect isotopic partitioning of the weath- ered pool of Cu between a light fraction adsorbed to10 Stable Isotopes of Transition and Post-Transition Metals as Tracers in Environmental Studies 179

particulates and a heavy dissolved fraction dominated by Cu bound to strong organic complexes, providing a mechanism to deliver heavy dissolved Cu to the oceans. Dissolved Cu in open ocean water samples was even heavier than that in the river waters, suggest- ing a continuation of the fractionation between dis- solved and particulate Cu fractions particularly in the surface ocean. 1.5 Zinc (Zn) The post-transition metal Zn is used in electroplating, metal alloys, pigment in paint, agricultural fertilizers and pesticides, galvanized rooﬁng material, and television-screen phosphors. Zinc is stable at the Earth’s surface in one oxidation state, Zn2+(Zn(II)). The large pool of Zn0metal produced industrially is manufactured speciﬁcally for purposes that take advantage of its high oxidation potential relative to other metals (e.g. as an anti-fouling and anti-corrosive agent on the submerged portion of ship hulls and propeller shafts). Zinc is an important enzyme cofactor, for example in alcohol dehydrogenase in humans, and is generally thought to be non-toxic. Zinc has ﬁve stable isotopes:64Zn (48.63%),66Zn (27.90%),67Zn (4.10%),68Zn (18.75%) and70Zn (0.62%). In natural materials, the measured range of 66Zn/64Zn is approximately 2 ‰(Cloquet et al. 2008). Mare´chal et al. (1999) published the ﬁrst high-quality measurements of zinc and copper isotope composi- tions in a variety of minerals and biological materials. Since this pioneering work the ﬁeld of Zn isotope biogeochemistry has rapidly expanded into a variety of environmental applications. For example, Zn has a relatively low boiling point (~910/C14C) compared with that of Cr or Cu, within the operating temperature range of ore smelters. Thus Zn can evaporate from ore during smelting, which would favor escape of light Zn isotopes in the exhaust as demonstrated by Mattielli et al. (2009), and retention of heavy Zn iso- topes in the slag residue as shown by Sivry et al. (2009). Kavner et al. (2008) demonstrated that elec- troplated Zn, reduced to metallic state from a large pool of aqueous Zn(II), is isotopically light compared to the parent solution, potentially resulting in a large pool of isotopically light electroplated Zn in the envi- ronment. In addition, Weiss et al. (2007) demonstratedthat Zn adsorption due to complexation by organic compounds is selective for the heavy Zn isotopes, resulting for example in peat samples that have heavier Zn isotope compositions than any potential natural source. On the other hand, Borrok et al. (2008) pointed out that Zn uptake by microorganisms is selective for the light Zn isotopes. Thus there are several fractionation processes for Zn that might modify its isotope composition in the environment. 1.6 Molybdenum (Mo) Molybdenum is used in the production of high- strength steel alloys, as pigments and catalysts, and in a variety of high temperature applications such as lubricants, electrical contacts and industrial motors. Molybdenum is stable at the Earth’s surface in several oxidation states, the most stable being Mo4+(Mo(IV)) and Mo6+(Mo(VI)). Molybdenum is an essential enzyme cofactor in nearly all organisms, with particu- lar importance for nitrogen ﬁxation, nitrate reduc- tion and sulﬁte oxidation. Molybdenum is soluble in strongly alkaline water such as seawater, forming molybdates (MoO 42-). Molybdates bear structural similarities to chromates, yet are weaker oxidants. In fact, although Mo lies directly below Cr in the periodic table, Mo compounds show more similarity to those of tungsten (W), which lies directly below Mo in the periodic table. Molybdenum has seven stable isotopes: 92Mo (14.84%),94Mo (9.25%),95Mo (15.92%),96Mo (16.68%),97Mo (9.55%),98Mo (24.13%) and 100Mo (9.63%). In natural materials, the measured range of97Mo/95Mo is ~3 ‰, with pelagic clays extending to /C01‰and suboxic sediment pore ﬂuids extending to þ2‰relative to a modeled “bulk earth” composition as deﬁned by Mo ores (Barling et al. 2001; Siebert et al. 2003; Anbar 2004; Arnold et al. 2004). Molybdenum isotopes are fractionated during adsorption to ferromanganese oxides in oxidizing environments (Barling et al. 2001; Barling and Anbar 2004) and precipitation of Fe-Mo-S solids in reducing environments (Poulson et al. 2006; Neubert et al. 2008), and the extent of fractionation differs in these two extreme conditions. Thus Mo isotopes can provide information about local redox conditions.180 T.D. Bullen

1.7 Cadmium (Cd) The post-transition metal Cd is used primarily in Ni-Cd batteries, metal alloys, electroplating, pigment in paint, and electronic components. Cadmium is stable at the Earth’s surface primarily in the Cd2+(Cd(II)) oxidation state. Cadmium has a strong geological afﬁnity to Zn, but unlike Zn can be toxic to humans due to its effective substitution for calcium in bone and its tendency to concentrate in the kidneys and liver where it may become carcinogenic. Cadmium has eight stable isotopes:106Cd (1.25%), 108Cd (0.89%),110Cd (12.49%),111Cd (12.80%), 112Cd (24.13%),113Cd (12.22%),114Cd (28.73%) and116Cd (7.49%). In terrestrial materials, the measured range of114Cd/110Cd is approximately 5‰; considering anthropogenically inﬂuenced mate- rials extends that range to ~1.5 ‰(Ripperger and Rehk €amper 2007; Schmitt et al. 2009a, b; Shiel et al. 2010). Cadmium has an even lower boiling point (~760/C14C) than Zn, and like Zn, Cd in ores likely evaporates during smelting favoring escape of light Cd isotopes in the exhaust, as recently demonstrated by Cloquet et al. (2006a). Cadmium behaves like Zn during electroplating (Kavner et al. 2008), potentially resulting in a large pool of isotopically light Cd in the environment. Although Cd is discussed in this chapter mainly in a multi-tracer context, Rehk €amper et al. (2011) provide a thorough discussion of the applica- tion of Cd isotopes in environmental studies. 1.8 Mercury (Hg) The post-transition metal Hg is used in thermometers and other scientiﬁc apparatus, amalgam for dental restoration, Hg vapor lamps, cosmetics, and liquid mirror telescopes. Historically, Hg has been widely used in gold mining operations. Mercury is stable at the Earth’s surface as soluble Hg2+(Hg(II)) and as Hg+ (Hg(I)) in the form of monomethylmercury (CH 3Hg+). In addition, and unlike the other transition and post- transition metals, Hg has a stable gaseous form (Hg0) at environmental temperatures with a residence time in the atmosphere of approximately 1 year (Schroeder and Munthe 1998). Mercury and its compounds (e.g. monomethylmercury (MeHg), mercuric chloride) areextremely toxic and can be readily ingested through inhalation or absorption through the skin and mucous membranes. Mercury has seven stable isotopes:196Hg (0.15%), 198Hg (9.97%),199Hg (16.87%),200Hg (23.10%), 201Hg (13.18%)202Hg (29.86%) and204Hg (6.87%). Based on the compilation of existing high-precision Hg isotope data reported by Bergquist and Blum (2009), the measured range of202Hg/198Hg in natural materials resulting from mass dependent fractionation (MDF) between coexisting Hg pools is approximately 7‰. This is remarkable, considering that measurable fractionation of Hg isotopes was generally thought to be non-existent as late as the 1990s. In addition, Hg stable isotopes exhibit considerable mass independent fractionation (MIF), in which the odd-numbered isotopes199Hg and201Hg behave differently than the even-numbered isotopes in certain chemical reactions such as photochemical reduction (Bergquist and Blum 2007), leading to signiﬁcant enrichments and deple- tions of the odd-numbered isotopes relative to the even-numbered isotopes in environmental Hg pools. Although Hg is included in the discussion here, Blum (2011) provides a thorough discussion of the theory and application of Hg isotopes in environmen- tal studies. In his chapter, Blum (2011) points out that most environmental applications of Hg isotopes are concerned with either (1) interpreting the isotopic composition of MeHg occurring in sediments and organisms, or (2) interpreting the isotopic composition of Hg(II) associated with sediments or deposited onto the land surface or into a water body. In addition, the author stresses the importance of redox reactions as the main cause of isotope fractionation in the Hg system and the role that the isotopes can play in helping to increase our understanding of the chemical bonding environments that lead to various Hg frac- tions in sediments and other natural materials. 1.9 Other Transition Metals Potentially Having Useful Isotopic Variability There are several other transition metals, outlined in blue in Fig. 10.1, that have multiple stable isotopes and thus the potential for stable isotope variability in10 Stable Isotopes of Transition and Post-Transition Metals as Tracers in Environmental Studies 181

nature, but which have yet to be rigorously explored in terms of isotope systematics. Examples of these ele- ments that would be especially useful in environmen- tal studies are titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), silver (Ag), tungsten (W) and rhenium (Re). For example, as pointed out by Severman and Anbar (2009), Re (185Re (37.4%),187Re (62.6%); common oxidation states Re2+,R e4+,R e6+,R e7+) is removed from solu- tion into sediments only under anoxic or suboxic con- ditions, making it a suitable tracer for moderately reducing conditions. In contrast, V (50V (0.25%),51V (99.75%); common oxidation states V2+,V3+,V4+,V5+) is scavenged from solution by manganese oxides and Fe-oxyhydroxides, making it a suitable tracer for oxic conditions. Both potential redox-tracing applications assume that sedimentation promotes isotope fraction- ation between sediment and residual aqueous pools of Re or V, but such fractionation has yet to be demon- strated. Silver, in addition to its historic value as a precious metal, is widely used in dentistry, photographic mate- rials, mirrors and optics, control rods in nuclear reac- tors, clothing (as an anti-fungal agent) and in certain medicines. Silver has the highest electrical conductiv- ity of any element and the highest thermal conductiv- ity of any metal and thus is widely used in electrical contacts and conductors. Silver is stable at the Earth’s surface primarily in three oxidation states: Ag0or native silver, and Ag1+and Ag2+, the common formsin a wide variety of Ag-containing compounds and minerals. Silver has two stable isotopes:107Ag (51.84%) and109Ag (48.16%). In an initial study of Ag stable isotope variation in sediment and domestic and industrial sludge samples, Luo et al. (2010) reported a small but signiﬁcant range of variation in 109Ag/107Ag of 0.1‰that bracketed the value for their standard. They found a different value for Ag from a ﬁsh liver (+0.28 ‰relative to their standard) that may indicate a biological inﬂuence. However, at this stage Ag is only beginning to be explored in terms of stable isotope variability. Tungsten provides an especially intriguing but as yet untested candidate for stable isotope variation in natural materials at the Earth’s surface. Tungsten is used in many high-temperature applications, such as light bulbs and welding processes, and in lubricants, abrasives, ceramic glazes, and heavy metal alloys. The most common oxidation state of W at the Earth’s surface is W6+, but W exhibits all oxidation states from W2-to W6+. Tungsten has ﬁve stable isotopes: 180W (0.12%),182W (26.50%),183W (14.31%),184W (30.64%) and186W (28.43%);180W is radioactive, but with a half-life of 1.8 /C21018years it is essentially stable. While there is substantial literature describing 182W variations in meteorites, there have been essentially no published systematic studies of low- temperature processes involving W. However, Irisawa and Hirata (2006) reported that W isotope ratios for Fig. 10.1 A portion of the Periodic Table of the Elements, showing the transition and post-transition metals. Elements with green borders are those for which signiﬁcant variability of stable isotope composition has been observed in natural materials. Elements with blue borders are those that havemore than one stable isotope and thus the potential to have variability of stable isotope composition in natural materials, but such variability has yet to be rigorously demonstrated. Ele- ments with red borders have only one stable isotope (no stable isotope in the case of Tc)182 T.D. Bullen

sediment reference materials differed signiﬁcantly from values for igneous rocks, hinting at the possi- bility that low-temperature redox and/or sorption processes may fractionate the W isotopes. The potential for Ti to have signiﬁcant variability of stable isotope composition in natural materials at the Earth’s surface is probably less than that for W, V and Re. This is due to the fact that the geochemistry of Ti is dominated by the Ti4+oxidation state, and Ti is not known to play a large role in biological processes such as enzyme stabilization. Regardless, titanium has ﬁve stable isotopes spanning a large mass range: 46Ti (8.0%),47Ti (7.3%),48Ti (73.8%),49Ti (5.5%) and50Ti (5.4%). If our experience with exploration of stable isotope variability of other elements dominated by a single oxidation state may serve as a guide, it is not unrealistic that a thorough reconnaissance study of Ti or other unexplored transition metal stable isotope systematics in environmental materials (e.g. nano- particles, pigments, electroplated steel) would reveal unexpected surprises. 2 Methodology Although the transition and post-transition metals rep- resent a geochemically diverse group of elements, the details of the analytical procedures required for measurement of their isotope compositions are quite uniform. Once a laboratory establishes a protocol for analysis of one of these metals, it can be relatively straightforward to add more of the remaining metals to the repertoire. On the other hand, transition and post- transition metals are everywhere, in ﬁeld and labora- tory equipment, and care must be taken to maintain strict cleanliness during sample collection, processing and measurement. 2.1 Sampling Protocols As a general rule, the sampling protocol for transition or post-transition metal isotope analysis of water is identical to that for standard dissolved cation analysis. The sample is collected using plastic tubing for pumps or plastic containers for dipping and placed into plastic containers that have been rinsed several times with thewater being collected. Pre-cleaning of the plastic con- tainers with nitric acid may be required if container “blanks”, obtained by allowing distilled water to sit in the container for an extended period of time, reveal signiﬁcant metal content. The sample needs to be ﬁltered, the pore-size of the ﬁlter being determined by the question being asked (e.g. is there isotopic fractionation between colloidal and non-colloidal size fractions?). Generally an in-line ﬁlter with 0.1 mm pore size provides sufﬁcient ﬁltration, but this may cause retention of some of the colloidal fraction as well (size: 1 nm–1 mm). Alternatively, the sample can be ﬁltered after initial collection using a plastic syringe ﬁtted with a disposable ﬁlter cartridge. Care must be taken to prevent possible redox changes of the redox-sensitive species in the oxic environment. Use of an in-line ﬁlter minimizes potential formation of Fe- and Mn-oxyhydroxides that can scavenge the metals from solution. Additionally, collection and ﬁltration can be carried out in a portable nitrogen- atmosphere glove box. The sample should be acidiﬁed with exceptionally clean nitric or hydrochloric acid, to a pH of approximately 2.0. Additional precautions such as wearing ultra-clean over-garments, gloves and boots may be required, particularly when metal concentrations are expected to be extremely small. Knowledge of metal concentrations in the sample prior to collection for isotope analysis is useful in order to ensure that sufﬁcient metal is collected to meet the requirements of the analytical technique. As a general rule of thumb, sufﬁcient material to provide 1–10 mg of the target metal should be collected when possible. The amount of metal required for isotope analysis ranges from as little as 5 ng to as much as 1mg, depending on factors such as ionization efﬁ- ciency in the mass spectrometer and resolution mode employed (see below). Moreover, knowledge of pro- cedural blank levels is useful for deciding what kinds of plastic tubing and containers to use and what pro- tective measures to take. A worthwhile exercise is to take a supply of the cleanest distilled laboratory water available to the ﬁeld site and to treat the distilled water as a sample, using all intended plastic tubing and containers, ﬁlters and other collection equipment, and techniques. One or two ﬁeld blanks should be collected during each sampling session, and the blank should be measured for concentration of the metal of interest prior to investing time in sample preparation and mass spectrometry.10 Stable Isotopes of Transition and Post-Transition Metals as Tracers in Environmental Studies 183

Collection of solid samples such as soils, plant tissues and landﬁll materials requires common sense more than anything. Solid samples should be collected into plastic bags, and care should be taken to ensure that sampling equipment (e.g. shovels, augers, stem- wood borers) do not contain the metal of interest. Particular care should be taken to avoid sampling equipment with painted surfaces as the paint is likely to have transition or post-transition metals as pigments. 2.2 Sample Preparation Prior to mass spectrometry, the metal of interest must be isolated from the rest of the sample matrix and particularly from elements that would produce iso- baric interferences on the target masses for analysis. For example, in preparing a sample for Cr isotope analysis, all Ti, V and Fe must be removed, as each of these metals has an isotope at the same mass as a Cr isotope. Similarly, some elements form double- charged ions in the mass spectrometer that are detected at ½ of their mass due to the direct depen- dence of ion ﬂight path through the magnetic sector of the mass spectrometer on mass:charge ratio of the ion. For example, Ba2+ions can be formed in both multi- collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectro- metry (MC-ICP-MS) and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), the two common methods for analysis of metal stable isotope composition.132Ba2+ would be detected at mass 66,134Ba2+would be detected at mass 67, and136Ba2+would be detected at mass 68, all directly overlapping the Zn isotopes of the same masses. Thus, a goal of the chemistry is to produce as pure a target metal fraction as possible, preferably if not assuredly with quantitative recovery. Most chemical procedures for puriﬁcation of the transition and post-transition metals involve some form of ion exchange chromatography, making use of different afﬁnities of the metals for the ion exchange resins in different strengths of acid media. For exam- ple, Wombacher et al. (2003) developed a method to purify Cd from geological materials and meteorites. The digested sample is dissolved in 3 M HCl and loaded directly onto an exchange column containing AG1-X8 strong acid anion exchange resin. The col- umn is rinsed with set volumes of 0.5, 1, 2 and ﬁnally8 M HCl in order to remove the majority of matrix elements. Following this series of rinses, all that remains on the resin are Ag, Zn, tin (Sn) and Cd. Additional rinsing with 8 M HCl removes the Ag, which can be retained for isotope analysis if desired (although quantitative recovery must be demonstrated). The rinse solution is then changed to a 0.5 M HNO 3–0.1 M HBr mixture, which removes Zn and some of the Sn from the column; this fraction can be retained for further processing for Zn isotope anal- ysis, if desired. The rinse solution is then changed to 2 M HNO 3, which removes the Cd and the remainder of the Sn. This product solution is then taken to dry- ness, re-dissolved in 6 M HCl and loaded onto a small column containing a resin (TRU Spec, Eichrom Industries) that retains the Sn but not the Cd, which is collected in a beaker. The product solution contains only Cd, and is ready for isotopic determination. This example demonstrates the versatility of the ion exchange resin method, and new element-speciﬁc resins are continually being developed as the need for new applications is encountered. Procedures for chemical puriﬁcation of the other transition and post-transition metals follow a similar logic and most are able to achieve quantitative recov- ery, thereby avoiding isotope fractionation on the resin column which has been demonstrated to occur for several elements such as Fe (Anbar et al. 2000).

A generalized schematic of these mass spectrometers is given in Fig. 10.2, which illustrates essential aspects of their184 T.D. Bullen

function (Bullen and Eisenhauer 2009). All instru- ments consist of three main components: ion source, ion optics (ion acceleration, ion beam focusing, isotope mass separation) and ion collection. Ions are produced by thermal processes in the source region: in MC-ICP-MS, the sample is injected into the source region either as a nebulized liquid aerosol or as ablated solid particulate in a gaseous stream which passes through a high-temperature plasma (up to 10,000/C14K; see photo insert in Fig. 10.2) at near-atmospheric pressure. At this high temperature, atoms of the sam- ple material are very efﬁciently ionized. In TIMS, the sample is deposited on a wire ﬁlament (see photo insert in Fig. 10.2), placed in a high vacuum (~10-8torr), and the ﬁlament is heated to the temperature required for ion production of the particular element (typically 800–1,700/C14C). The ions produced in either instrument then enter the optics region, where they are accelerated through a large potential (up to 10 kV) and focused electronically to create a discrete ion beam. In MC- ICP-MS, the vacuum must be substantially improved over this short optics region via efﬁcient mechanical and electrical “ion getter” vacuum pumps. Beyond the ion optics region, an exceptional vacuum (~10-8torr) must be maintained in both instruments.The accelerated and focused ion beam then passes through a slit into the ﬂight tube where the different isotopes of the element are dispersed by mass using an electromagnet. The width of the slit determines the ability of the mass spectrometer to partially resolve sample ions and extraneous molecules of nearly simi- lar mass (“isobaric interferences”). For example, since the plasma in ICP-source instruments is predomi- nantly composed of Ar, a narrow slit must be used to resolve56Fe from40Ar16O. In TIMS instruments,56Fe must be resolved from organic molecules with mass ~56 atomic mass units. In general, a narrower slit provides greater resolving power but reduced signal intensity. The fundamental power of MC-ICP-MS and TIMS instruments to disperse the isotopes of an element rests in the ability of the magnet to differentially divert the ﬂight paths of the various isotopes according to their individual energies. The ion ﬂight paths are bent along the axis of the ﬂight tube depending on the ratio of ion mass to charge: light ions are bent more (green path in diagram), heavy ions are bent less (red path in dia- gram). For any particular isotope, a restricted range of ion energies leaving the magnetic sector is required to create a concentrated, ﬂat-topped signal that is ideal Fig. 10.2 Generalized schematic of the important aspects of multi-collector mass spectrometers used for determination of metal stable isotope compositions.

for detection and measurement. In TIMS, ions of a particular isotope produced at the source ﬁlament are essentially mono-energetic, and once the ion beam is focused in the source region mass (i.e. energy) disper- sion can be effectively achieved in the magnetic sec- tor. In contrast, in MC-ICP-MS ions of a particular isotope leave the source region having a fairly wide energy distribution due to numerous processes occur- ring in the source region. Thus in most MC-ICP-MS instruments, the poly-energetic ion beam must ﬁrst pass through an electrostatic discriminator (not shown) which disperses the ion beam in exactly the opposite sense to that which follows in the magnetic sector. As a result of exacting electromechanical design, the ion beam that ultimately passes out of the magnetic sector has a balanced and much smaller energy spread that allows the ﬂat-topped signal to develop. In a few MC-ICP-MS instruments, the ion beam ﬁrst passes through a “collision cell” containing molecules of a gas such as Ar where collisions of the metal ions with the gas molecules substantially reduce the kinetic energies of those ions, which can then be reaccelerated in a nearly mono-energetic condition for passage through the magnetic ﬁeld as in TIMS. Ion detection collectors are conﬁgured to perfectly intersect the resulting ﬂight paths of the component isotope ion beams of the element. In some instruments, collectors can be moved perpendicularly to the ion paths until desired coincidence is achieved for a particular element. In other instruments, the collector positions are ﬁxed and the trajectories of the ion beams themselves are adjusted along the ﬁnal section of the ﬂight tube by further electronic focusing in order to achieve coincidence. Collectors are either Faraday cages, credit-card sized, thin rectangular boxes open on one narrow end to receive and trap ions on the internal surfaces resulting in a measurable total ion current on the internal surfaces, or ion counters that record individual ion collisions with the counter sur- faces. Faraday cages may have slits positioned along the ion ﬂight path prior to the point of ion entry into the cage in order to better shape the ion beam for optimum signal detection. Channel-speciﬁc total ion currents detected over a certain period of time are then processed through a series of electronic conversions into signals that can be interpreted by computer soft- ware as relative isotope abundances for the element. Each instrument has its advantages in certain applications, but as a general rule the stable isotopecomposition of all the transition and post-transition metals discussed in this chapter can be most efﬁciently determined using MC-ICP-MS. The high ionization efﬁciency of the plasma source used to generate ions in MC-ICP-MS compared to that of the metal ﬁlament source used in TIMS results in improved isotope mea- surement of very small quantities (i.e. tens of nano- grams) of elements with high ionization potentials, such as Zn (e.g. Chen et al. 2008), Mo (e.g. Barling and Anbar 2004), and Hg (e.g. Blum and Bergquist 2007). In addition, MC-ICP-MS instruments typically have the capability to sufﬁciently resolve measureable portions of metal ion beams from “isobaric” poly- atomic interfering species having nearly the same mass (e.g.56Fe vs.40Ar16O generated in the Ar plasma). Some interfering species, primarily oxides, can also be removed from the ion stream to a large extent by desolvating the sample prior to introduction to the plasma. Alternatively, in some instruments polyatomic molecules can be disaggregated in the collision cell apparatus described above due to colli- sions of the molecules with atoms of the gas supplied to the cell. In MC-IPC-MS, uncertainty due to signal noise resulting from the inherent instability of the plasma source is eliminated by measuring all ion beams simultaneously with the multicollector array. An additional strength of MC-ICP-MS is that samples can be introduced using laser ablation equipment, in which layers of atoms are sputtered off the surface of a solid material and transported by a gas stream to the plasma for ionization. Excellent references on the general topic of isotope analysis by MC-ICP-MS are Albare `de and Beard (2004), Rehk €amper et al. (2004) and Wieser and Schwieters (2005). On the other hand, TIMS has been used for more than 50 years and has long been the workhorse for metal isotope research. TIMS provided much of the data on transition and post-transition metal stable iso- tope systematics prior to the proliferation of MC-ICP- MS in research labs and continues to provide excellent isotope measurements for more readily ionized ele- ments such as Cr (e.g. Ellis et al. 2002) and Fe (Bullen and Amundson 2010) and even for elements that are difﬁcult to ionize such as Cd (Schmitt et al. 2009a, b). TIMS is less affected by isobaric interferences than MC–ICP–MS because there is no need for the Ar gas and because the sample is ionized under high vacuum rather than in an aqueous solution or gas stream at atmospheric pressure. TIMS likewise beneﬁts from186 T.D. Bullen

simultaneous multicollector ion beam detection (Fantle and Bullen 2009). Typical external precision (i.e. comparison of total procedural replicates for nat- ural samples) is at the 0.1 ‰level for both TIMS and MC–ICP–MS. A disadvantage of both instruments is a sizable footprint in the laboratory and high costs for purchase and maintenance. 2.4 Data: Acquisition, Reduction, Accuracy, and Standard Reference Materials Isotope fractionation of the ion beam produced in both TIMS and MC-ICP-MS, which is an unavoidable char- acteristic of both analytical platforms, means that the relative proportion of isotopes of an element reaching the detectors in the mass spectrometer is not identical to that of the sample. This instrument-induced frac- tionation, or “mass bias”, is often larger than the isotopic variation between samples. In MC-IPC-MS, light ions of any element are preferentially discrimi- nated against and removed from the ion stream at the sampling cones situated just beyond the plasma source, resulting in relatively heavy raw measured ratios that tend to stay very constant over the course of a measurement. In TIMS, light ions of any element are preferentially ionized off the ﬁlament surface, causing the raw measured ratio to be light at the outset and progressively heavier over the course of a mea- surement. Thus it is essential to provide some means to correct for isotope discrimination so that measured isotope compositions of samples can be compared to those of standards and other samples. The classic approach to correct for isotope discrim- ination in TIMS is referred to as the double spike technique . An excellent treatment of the theoretical aspects of the double spike technique is given by Johnson and Beard (1999), and a practical overview of the technique is provided by Rudge et al. (2009). This technique requires that the element have at least four naturally-occurring isotopes, two that can be used as isotopes for the double spike and two that can be used to calculate a ratio that provides information on the relative natural isotope composition of a sam- ple. The double spike is a mixture of two typically minor isotopes of the element that have each beenindustrially enriched in their proportion relative to the other isotopes. There are now several commercial suppliers of highly enriched (i.e. typically >90% pure) stable isotopes of most multi-isotopic elements, and thus it is relatively straightforward to create a double spike using any combination of two isotopes of an element. The double spike mixture, which has been carefully characterized for isotope composition and concentration, is added to a sample prior to analysis thus imparting an unnatural isotope composition to the sample-double spike mixture. Following analysis, the measured ratio of the two isotopes used to create the double spike can be compared to the known, care- fully characterized value to obtain a “mass bias factor” that quantiﬁes isotope fractionation that has occurred during analysis. The measured isotope composition of the sample-double spike mixture can then be corrected based on this mass bias factor, and the double spike component of the mixture can be mathematically subtracted from the fractionation-corrected composi- tion to reveal the natural ratios of the two or more isotopes not used for the double spike as the residual. For example, the53Cr/52Cr natural isotope ratio of a sample can be determined using a double spike consisting of a mixture of nearly pure50Cr and54Cr, the two minor isotopes of Cr. Of the elements dis- cussed here, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Cd, Mo, Hg, Ti, and W are suitable for analysis by the double spike technique while Ag, Re and V are not. An important advantage of the double spike technique is that the double spike solution can be added to the sample prior to puri- ﬁcation chemistry, and thus, without any additional effort, can be used to correct for isotope fractionation that might occur during chemical puriﬁcation prior to analysis (e.g. due to non-quantitative recovery of the metal from the resin). The nature of MC-ICP-MS allows application of two additional techniques for correction of isotope discrimination in the instrument during analysis, standard-sample-standard bracketing and internal standardization . As the name implies, in standard- sample-standard bracketing a standard solution is analyzed directly before and after a sample, and the interpolated isotope ratio of the standard at the time of the sample analysis is taken as the reference value. This is an incredibly straightforward approach, but assumes that the sample and standard behave similarly in the plasma (e.g. have identical matrices). With internal standardization, an element with a known10 Stable Isotopes of Transition and Post-Transition Metals as Tracers in Environmental Studies 187

--- Page 11 ---
isotope composition and similar fractionation behav- ior to the element being analyzed is added to the sample solution prior to aspiration into the plasma (e.g. Zr as an internal standard for Mo isotope analysis, Cu as an internal standard for Fe or Zn isotope analy- sis). The isotope ratio measured for the internal stan- dard can be compared to its known value to quantify machine-induced fractionation and a correction can then be applied to the isotope ratio of the target ele- ment on a scan by scan basis. Using internal standar- dization, a plot of the measured isotope ratios of the target element vs. those of the internal standard ele- ment typically deﬁnes a mass dependent fractionation relationship that provides the basis for the correction (Longerich et al. (1987); Mare ´chal et al. (1999). The power of the standard-sample-standard brack- eting and internal standardization techniques is that they can be used for isotopic analysis of any element having two or more isotopes. On the other hand, the double spike technique required for TIMS stable iso- tope analysis can likewise be used for MC-ICP-MS isotope analysis of elements having four or more iso- topes, and is in essence a special case of internal standardization. The advantage of using a double spike for MC-ICP-MS analysis is that quantitative yield during sample puriﬁcation is not required as it is for standard-sample-standard bracketing and inter- nal standardization approaches (Siebert et al. 2001). Differences in transition and post-transition metal stable isotope composition between materials tend to be small, a few parts per thousand at most, so that differences in absolute isotope ratio are difﬁcult to conceptualize. For example, say that the53Cr/52Cr ratio determined by TIMS for a native groundwater sample is 0.114000, while the value for the Cr isotope standard is 0.113392. To better visualize this small difference, most researchers in the ﬁeld have adopted the delta notation used for gas isotope ratio compari- son so that ratios can be compared on a per mil ( ‰) basis. Using the Cr example: d53=52Cr¼1000/C3ð53Cr=52Crgroundwater /C053Cr=52Crstandard Þ=53Cr=ð52Crstandard Þ ¼1000/C30:114000 /C00:113392 ðÞ =0:113392 ¼þ5:36: dvalues are preceded by a plus or minus sign to denote ratios that are, respectively, heavier or lighterthan the reference material, which in this case is NIST 979 Cr metal. There are two important variants of the d notation: (1) DA-Bmay be used to represent the differ- ence in dvalues between two samples, A and B; and (2) workers may use the enotation, equal to 10 times d, or parts per 10,000, in cases where differences in isotope composition between samples are extremely small. Caution is advised as there are additional uses of both Dandein isotope science terminology, and some researchers report isotope ratio variations on a per atomic mass unit basis. Standard reference materials (SRM) provide the basis for inter- and intra-laboratory comparison of isotope ratio measurements. While the mass spectro- meters used in different laboratories might produce different absolute values for an SRM, the ratios obtained on samples are comparable through use of the delta scale described above, calculated relative to the SRM. Most standards used in metal stable isotope research are supplied by two sources: the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM, Belgium) and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST, USA). Both organizations have gone to great lengths to produce large quantities of metal isotope SRM, which have been rigorously assessed through round-robin analyses at a number of isotope laboratories. A good SRM must (1) be in abundant supply and available for distribution, (2) be homogeneous in isotopic composition across the supply, (3) have an isotopic composition similar to or border- ing the range to be measured in samples, and (4) have an agreed-upon value. Ideally, for a given metal it is preferable to have at least two well-characterized SRM that bracket the range of isotope ratios antici- pated in samples. This is rarely the case, and thus most researchers rely on a single SRM that is used widely by other laboratories, together with routinely analyzed internal standards used to monitor consistency of lab- oratory processing and mass spectrometer function. An important point is that all isotope research should be conducted using widely available SRM in order to allow other laboratories to make a check of accuracy. Commonly used SRM include: Cr, NIST 979; Fe, IRMM-014; Ni, NIST 986; Cu, NIST 976; Zn, JMC (Johnson Matthey Corporation) 3-0749-L and IRMM- 3702; Mo, NIST 3134 (proposed; presently there is no internationally accepted SRM (Wen et al. 2010), but acceptance by the isotope community requires a period of inter-laboratory comparison to validate the188 T.D.

choice); Cd, JMC lot 502552A and NIST 3108; Ag, NIST 978a. Note that there are currently no inter- nationally accepted or proposed SRM for Ti, V, W or Re isotope analysis. IRMM and NIST typically supply an SRM for metal stable isotope analysis in the form of a puriﬁed metal or salt, both of which are easy to dissolve and use routinely. However, some researchers choose to use natural samples as standards, provided those samples meet the criteria listed above. The advan- tage of using a natural material as an SRM is that it must follow the same chemical puriﬁcation steps as samples, thus assuring integrity of the chemical pro- cedures. For some metals, there are both natural and synthetic SRM. For Fe stable isotope research, for example, there are two widely available SRM: speciﬁc basalts and other igneous rocks, which have been shown to have uniform isotope composition (Beard et al. 2003), and IRMM-014, a synthetic iron standard. The isotope composition of IRMM-014 is now gener- ally considered to be the zero point for the delta scale; on this basis, igneous rocks have on average a d56/54Fe value of þ0.09‰. Unfortunately, Fe lacks SRM having isotope compositions at the light and heavy extremes of the natural spectrum. 3 Metal Stable Isotope Fractionation Processes Isotope fractionation is a set of processes which can divide an isotopically homogeneous pool of an ele- ment into multiple fractions that have different com- plementary isotope compositions. For a given element, observed fractionation may be either mass dependent, scaling approximately as the mass difference between isotope pairs, or mass independent, where one isotope behaves non-systematically with respect to the others. By far, most of the stable isotope variability of the transition and post-transition metals observed to date has resulted from mass dependent processes. There are two main categories of isotope frac- tionation processes that affect the transition and post-transition metals, kinetic isotope effects and equi- librium isotope exchange. Kinetic isotope effects result from uni-directional physical and chemical reactions, during which the light isotope is alwaysfavored in the product phase. Examples of processes resulting in kinetic isotope effects are evaporation, where light isotopes of metals such as Zn and Cd escape more efﬁciently at the liquid-air interface than heavy isotopes (e.g. Cloquet et al. 2006a, b), electro- plating, where light isotopes of metals from the plating bath are preferentially deposited onto a metal substrate (Kavner et al. 2008), and diffusion (Richter et al. 2009). A special class of kinetic isotope effects arises for elements having differences in speciﬁc isotope reaction rates, for example where the odd-numbered isotopes of Hg behave non-systematically with respect to the even-numbered isotopes (Bergquist and Blum 2009; Blum 2011). Isotope equilibrium results from protracted exchange between reaction products and reactants, and at equilibrium the products may be either lighter or heavier than the reactants depending on factors such as metal ion coordination, packing density and bond strength. Examples of processes resulting in isotope equilibrium are the partitioning of relatively heavy Fe into [Fe(III)(H 2O)6](aq)3+com- pared to Fe in coexisting [Fe(II)(H 2O)6](aq)2+(Johnson et al. 2002; Welch et al. 2003), and the exchange of Fe between hematite and [Fe(III)(H 2O)6](aq)3+leading to identical Fe isotope compositions of these two phases (i.e. no isotope fractionation). This latter example is interesting in that hematite formed initially in synthe- sis experiments has light Fe relative to coexisting [Fe(III)(H 2O)6](aq)3+due to kinetic isotope effects that are subsequently reversed (Skulan et al. 2002). Note that isotope equilibrium between liquid and vapor is likewise possible, as in the case of Hg (Estrade et al. 2009). Excellent discussions of the topic of kinetic and equilibrium isotope fractionation, with examples pertinent to environmental studies, are provided by Clark and Fritz (1997) and Kendall and McDonnell (1998). Redox reactions, whether strictly inorganic or microbially mediated, consistently result in signiﬁcant metal stable isotope fractionation, and the reduced species of the metal redox pair is generally isotopi- cally lighter than the oxidized species. Thus, deter- mination of the isotope composition of redox-sensitive metals has proven useful for understanding redox dynamics in paleo- and present-day environmental systems (Severmann and Anbar 2009; Bergquist and Blum 2009; Bullen and Walczyk 2009). On the other hand, the stable isotope composition of metals which occur naturally in only one redox state (e.g. Cd, Zn)10 Stable Isotopes of Transition and Post-Transition Metals as Tracers in Environmental Studies 189

--- Page 13 ---
but which may fractionate during complexation with redox-sensitive species such as sulfur (Schauble 2003) or with organic matter (Weiss et al. 2007) can likewise be indicative of redox conditions. Sorption of metals onto the surfaces of minerals in sediments and soils is an environmentally important process that can help to moderate aqueous concentra- tions of those metals and aid in metal contaminant remediation. Isotope fractionation associated with sorption has been recognized for several of the transi- tion and post-transition metals, but is highly element speciﬁc. For example, sorption of isotopically light Mo onto ferromanganese oxides in the oxic oceans is viewed as having been an important isotope fraction- ation process for Mo over much of Earth history (Wasylenki et al. 2008). In contrast, sorbed Fe(II) on goethite was found to be isotopically heavy com- pared to [Fe(II)(H 2O)6](aq)3+in a series of carefully conducted equilibrium isotope exchange experiments reported by Beard et al. (2010). In the case of Cr, only a negligible isotope fractionation was observed between sorbed and aqueous CrO 42-and HCr 2O7- when either g-Al2O3or goethite was used as the sorp- tion substrate (Ellis et al. 2004). Coordination environment of the metals in liquids and solids is an additional important determinant of stable isotope fractionation. In general, for a given system chemistry, higher coordination favors the ligh- ter isotopes. Using the system Fe-O as an example, Fe in hematite (Fe 2O3) is in octahedral coordination while Fe in magnetite (Fe 3O4) is in both octahedral and tetrahedral coordination within their respective oxy- gen framework. The result is a higher average coordi- nation number for Fe in hematite than for Fe in magnetite. As expected, when the two phases coexist at or near equilibrium, Fe in hematite is isotopically lighter than Fe in magnetite by approximately 3 ‰,a s has been reported for coexisting magnetite-hematite pairs in banded iron formations (Johnson et al. 2003). The difference in metal ion coordination environment in coexisting solid-liquid pairs is likewise an impor- tant determinant of stable isotope fractionation. For example, theoretical calculations of equilibrium iso- tope fractionation predict that aqueous Fe(II), which is in octahedral coordination within a “hexaquo” inner hydration sphere ([Fe(II)(H 2O)6](aq)2+), should be heavier than Fe(II) in coexisting siderite (FeCO 3), in which the Fe(II) is in more open octahedral coordina- tion with oxygen of the carbonate groups (Polyakovand Mineev 2000; Schauble 2004). Siderite synthesis experiments conﬁrm the sense of this theoretical frac- tionation, but observed magnitudes are less than those predicted by theory (Wiesli et al. 2004). Gaining a better understanding of aqueous metal coordination environments and the implications for stable isotope fractionation is one of the major challenges facing the ﬁeld. 4 Applications of Metal Isotopes to Environmental Studies The transition and post-transition metals are subject to numerous potential isotope fractionation processes over a wide range of environmental conditions, and thus their isotope compositions may provide a unique record of those processes that can be used to under- stand present-day and paleo-environmental systems. In this section, several examples are given that illus- trate the spectrum of environmental issues that can be addressed using these novel stable isotope tracers as process recorders. These include using the isotopes to trace metal contaminants, to identify metal redox pro- cesses, to assess plant nutrition cycles and understand processes within plants, and to serve as biomarkers. Although familiarity with the general topic of stable isotope biogeochemistry will help the reader to appre- ciate the details of the following examples, the intro- ductory material and references in this and other chapters of this book should help those not familiar with the ﬁeld to better understand why the isotopes are useful and how they work in these speciﬁc cases. 4.1 Tracing Metal Contaminant Sources and Sinks The ability of isotope signatures to trace the sources of and processes affecting metal contaminants in ground- water and the atmosphere appears to be receiving the most attention from research groups focused on envi- ronmental applications of transition and post-transition metal stable isotopes. Of metal contaminants in groundwater, Cr(VI) is arguably the best understood in terms of isotope systematics based on laboratory190 T.D. Bullen

--- Page 14 ---
experiments, and Cr stable isotopes have been used to study the fate of toxic Cr contamination at numerous ﬁeld sites. Of the potential metal contaminants in the atmosphere, the most progress has been made in understanding Hg sources and sinks as discussed by Blum (2011), but Zn, Cd and Cr are likewise receiving considerable attention and are discussed here. 4.1.1 Tracing Sources of Chromium in Groundwater As described above in the overview of Cr, reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is accompanied by a large isotope fractionation. Thus, Cr stable isotopes should be use- ful for monitoring Cr(VI) reduction in a contaminant plume, for distinguishing between Cr(VI) reduction and advective mixing with Cr-free groundwater (two mechanisms that can decrease Cr(VI) concentrations in the contaminant plume), and potentially for distin- guishing between industrial and natural sources of Cr (VI). Sources of Cr used for industrial purposes are likely to be Cr ore deposits and minerals, which con- sistently have d53/52Cr values close to 0 ‰relative to NIST 979 (Ellis et al. 2002; Schoenberg et al. 2008). In contrast, naturally occurring Cr in groundwater dis- plays a range of values ( d53/52Cr: +1.0 to +5.8 ‰; Ellis et al. 2002; Izbicki et al. 2008). These values likely reﬂect fractionation during oxidation of Cr(III) on manganese oxides and fractionation during subsequent reduction of Cr(VI) along groundwater ﬂowpaths fol- lowing mobilization of the highly soluble Cr(VI) from mineral surface sorption sites. Thus under favorable conditions the natural and industrial Cr pools at a con- taminated site may have different d53/52Cr values. In order to test the usefulness of Cr stable isotopes for Cr contamination source assessment and process identiﬁcation at a well-studied contaminated site, a pilot study (CH2MHill 2007) was carried out at the Paciﬁc Gas & Electric (PG&E) Compressor Facility in Hinkley, California, made famous in the movie “Erin Brockovich.” From 1952 to 1966, waste water containing Cr(VI) used as an anti-corrosive in the cooling towers leaked into the underlying sandy aquifer, creating a plume of Cr(VI)-contaminated groundwater that by 2000 had migrated nearly 2 miles downgradient from the facility. Groundwater samples from immediately adjacent to the facility, from within the plume, and of regional groundwatercollected well away from the plume were analyzed for Cr stable isotope composition (Bullen 2007). As shown in Fig. 10.3, the data plot along a well- organized trend, with near-facility (contaminant) and regional groundwaters deﬁning the extremes, while samples from the contaminant plume plot in between. There is no question that in this particular case, the Cr stable isotopes clearly distinguish the natural and anthropogenic Cr(VI) end-members. It is less clear how the samples collected from the contaminant plume obtained their compositions ind53/52Cr-Cr concentration space. For example, as shown in Fig. 10.3 the plume sample data all lie well to the low-Cr side of model trends describing both abiotic and microbially-mediated Cr(VI) reduction (Ellis et al. 2002; Sikora et al. 2008) and well to the high- d53/52Cr side of the model trend for advective mixing between near-facility contaminant and regional groundwaters, suggesting that neither Cr(VI) reduction nor advective mixing alone is able to account for those compositions. However, some com- bination of Cr(VI) reduction and advective mixing could account for the plume sample compositions, and a scenario that is at least consistent with ﬁeld relations (Bullen 2007) is shown in Fig. 10.3. In this scenario, Cr(VI) at the front and margins of the migrat- ing contaminant plume would come into contact with the limited reductant (e.g. ferrous iron, organic matter) in this aquifer, allowing small amounts of Cr(VI) reduction to occur and driving remnant Cr(VI) compo- sitions along the model Cr(VI) reduction vectors. At the same time, advective mixing with regional ground- waters at the plume front and margins would shift remnant Cr(VI) compositions to the low-Cr side of the model Cr(VI) reduction vectors (e.g. along trajec- tories similar to the lines labeled “plume front Cr(VI) reduction-mixing” in Fig. 10.3). After 40 years of plume migration, one could imagine an array of devel- oped plume front and margin groundwater composi- tions similar to region “FM” in Fig. 10.3. This range of plume front and margin groundwater compositions would result from speciﬁc evolutionary trends that depend on the relative amount of Cr(VI) reduction and advective mixing with regional groundwater that occurred at any particular position along the plume front or margin. In this scenario, the actual plume sample array would develop by advective mixing between these hypothesized plume front and margin groundwaters and the contaminated groundwater10 Stable Isotopes of Transition and Post-Transition Metals as Tracers in Environmental Studies 191

within the plume body itself. Note that extremely careful, discrete depth sampling at the plume front and margins would be necessary to conﬁrm the exis- tence and determine the exact shape of the “FM” region hypothesized in Fig. 10.3, but such an effort would be useful for supporting the validity of this proposed scenario. In their detailed time-series study of a point-source Cr contamination plume emanating from a Cr plating facility in Berkeley, California, Berna et al. (2010) observed a similar trend for plume groundwater samples in d53/52Cr-Cr concentration space, such that the plume samples had intermediate compositions between vectors describing Cr(VI) reduction and advective mixing with Cr-free groundwater. Althoughthey concluded that Cr(VI) reduction and advective mixing were important processes determining the composition of the plume groundwater samples, they likewise pointed to the potential importance of hetero- geneous Cr(VI) reduction in the aquifer. Their labora- tory incubation experiments had demonstrated that Cr (VI) reduction was limited to greenish, ﬁne-grained lenses that are embedded in non-reducing aquifer materials. They proposed that total reduction of small pools of Cr(VI) in the greenish lenses would decrease the amount of Cr(VI) measured in a down- gradient sampling well, but would not change the d53/ 52Cr value of the remaining Cr(VI) transported through the non-reducing aquifer materials. As a result, the d53/52Cr value of groundwater sampled along the plume is not as high and the d53/52Cr value of Cr(III) immobilized on the aquifer sediment is not as low as would be predicted for a system where reduction occurs homogeneously throughout the aquifer. As at Hinkley, careful discrete depth sampling would help to determine the inﬂuence of aquifer heterogeneity on Cr(VI) reduction effective- ness and measured d53/52Cr values. 4.1.2 Sources of Zinc in River Water As described above in the overview on Zn, there are several processes that may result in Zn stable isotope fractionation including biological incorporation, abi- otic adsorption, chemical diffusion and industrial pro- cessing. Although Zn is not a highly toxic metal it does provide a useful index of environmental contamina- tion because it is commonly associated with toxic metals such as Cd and Pb. Thus Zn stable isotopes may be useful for distinguishing natural and anthro- pogenic sources of metals in both hydrologic and atmospheric systems. An interesting example of the usefulness of Zn isotopes to trace contaminant sources is the work of Chen et al. (2008, 2009) who studied Zn isotope sys- tematics of the Seine River of France. The Seine River is one of the most anthropogenically impacted rivers in Europe, with high relative concentrations of metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, etc.) in dissolved and suspended loads compared to large rivers of the world (Chen et al. 2009). For their study, these workers sampled both the dissolved and suspended particulate matter (SPM) fractions of Seine River waters along the length–1012345 1 Cr(VI) ppbδ53 Cr Cr source abiotic Cr(VI) reduction Cr plume microbial Cr(VI) reduction regional groundwater plume front Cr(VI) reduction-mixing Cr source-regional groundwater mixing mixing within plumeCr(VI) remaining in plume after partial reduction Immobilized Cr(III) “FM” 0 10.0 100.0 1000.0 10000.0 Fig. 10.3 d53/52Cr and Cr(VI) concentration data for ground- water at the Hinkley, CA site “Cr source” samples were col- lected at the PG&E compressor facility, “Cr plume” samples were collected downgradient of the compressor facility within the Cr(VI) plume. “Regional groundwater” samples were col- lected just upgradient, just down gradient, and well away from the plume.

of the river and, during both high and low ﬂow peri- ods, in the center of the city of Paris. This sampling strategy allowed these workers to test for a Zn isotope signal of industrial and urban activity, since most industry is concentrated in and downstream of Paris. Chen et al. (2009) observed an overall negative correlation between d66/64Zn of SPM and the Zn enrichment factor (EF), which describes the enrich- ment of Zn in a sample relative to the natural back- ground and is deﬁned as: EF¼ðZn=AlÞsample =ðZn=AlÞbackground where (Zn/Al) background was estimated using average concentrations of Zn and Al in uncontaminated forest sediments and pre-historical deposits as assessed by Thevenot et al. (2007). Speciﬁcally, as shown in Fig. 10.4a, SPM samples with lesser d66/64Zn and greater Zn EF were those collected within Paris during the low ﬂow periods and from downstream of Paris. Chen et al. (2009) identiﬁed two potential anthro- pogenic contaminant sources, Zn in roof runoff from buildings in Paris and waste water treatment plant efﬂuent, each having low d66/64Zn and high Zn EF that could explain the low ﬂow Zn isotope signal. In contrast, background Zn from upstream sources was determined to have elevated d66/64Zn and low Zn EF based on analyses of bedrock from the region (the composition for bedrock granite from the region is shown in Fig. 10.4a) and the compositions of SPM from upstream of Paris. Chen et al. (2009) observed additional complexity when they considered d66/64Zn of SPM and d66/64Zn of dissolved Zn together (Fig. 10.4b). Seine Basin transect and Paris low ﬂow samples deﬁned a linear array that could be explained by mixing between natural and anthropogenic end-members. The natural end-member (Zn nat) was inferred to have d66/64Zn of SPM similar to that of bedrock granite (+0.33 ‰) and d66/64Zn of dissolved Zn similar to that of Cretaceous chalk from the region (+0.90 ‰), highlighting the fact that Zn in SPM and the dissolved phase can come from different sources. Some Paris high ﬂow samples required an additional component, again having d66/64Zn of SPM similar to that of bedrock granite, but having d66/64Zn of dissolved Zn reﬂecting a mix-ture of Zn from Cretaceous chalk (the dissolved com- ponent of Zn nat) and the dissolved component of Zn from roof runoff (Zn rr). Chen et al. (2009) suggested that urban Zn storm runoff (Zn urb) adds considerable dissolved Zn but only minor SPM associated with zinc rooﬁng materials to the river.

Paris high ﬂow samples require an additional “urban” end-member (Zn urb, having d66/64Zn of SPM dominated by bedrock granite and d66/64Zn of dissolved Zn reﬂecting a mixture of Cretaceous chalk Zn and Zn from roof runoff (Zn rr).

4.1.3 Tracing Sources of Metals in Dust Using a Multi-Tracer Approach Inhalation of dust particles is potentially a primary delivery mechanism of toxic metals to humans. More- over, incorporation of deposited dust in soil can allow the metals to become available to plants, providing an additional source of metal loading to crops. There are many possible sources of transition and post-transition metals that could supply the metal content of dust. The major contributors are likely to include metal reﬁning and smelting, coal combustion ﬂy ash and residues, petroleum burning and particularly vehicle emissions, municipal waste incineration, scrap metal deterioration, and wood burning. Early approaches for identifying dust sources relied on tracers such as concentration ratios of metals and surrogates such as strontium iso- topes that might be able to tie the dust back to speciﬁc geologic or regional sources. While there have been numerous examples of success with this approach, environmental isotope scientists have been exploring whether the stable isotope composition of the transition and post-transition metals might be more directly use- ful for ﬁngerprinting the sources of the metals in dust. Of the potential sources for these metals listed above, metal reﬁning and smelting have received the most attention, mainly for Zn and Cd, pointing to the unique physical characteristics of these two post- transition metals. As noted above in the overview on these elements, their boiling points are sufﬁciently low that they can both be evaporated in the smelter fur- nace, resulting in a kinetic isotope fractionation that partitions light metal into the vapor that escapes the factory stack. For Zn, light compositions in reﬁnery stack emissions have been documented by Mattielli et al. (2009), while heavy compositions in residual slag compositions have been documented by Sivry et al. (2009). For Cd, the same sense of isotope frac- tionation was observed for smelter exhaust and slag by Cloquet et al. (2006a). Mercury similarly has a low boiling point within the range of smelter and waste incinerator furnace temperatures, and partitioning of light Hg into stack emissions has been proposed (Estrade et al. 2010). Thus the association of light Zn, Cd, and Hg, along with unfractionated compositions relative to the ore sources for other metals having far greater boiling points (such as Cr and Cu) could impli- cate a metal reﬁning smelter exhaust stack source for those metals in dust samples.The Zn and Cd stable isotope compositions of the other potential sources of metals in dust listed above are less constrained, although some reconnais- sance values for Zn are available in the literature. Cloquet et al. (2006b) reported d66/64Zn values for particulates trapped on bus air ﬁlters and emitted in urban waste incinerator ﬂue gas from Metz, France, which spanned a small range from +0.04 to +0.19 ‰ relative to the JMC-Lyon Zn standard. On the other hand, lichens collected from around Metz that had high Pb concentrations and Pb isotope signatures consistent with a leaded gasoline source likewise had high Zn concentrations and negative d66/64Zn (to /C00.2‰), suggesting that light Zn might be associated with road trafﬁc circulation. Sivry et al. (2008) reported d66/64Zn of +0.72 ‰for a coal ash from southwest France, which is consistent with the associ- ation of heavy Zn with organic materials recognized by Weiss et al. (2007). In their study of sources of metals observed in dust samples collected in Paris, France, Widory et al. (2010) have expanded this emerging isotope database for the sources and speciﬁcally have measured Zn, Cd, and Cr stable isotope compositions for each of their samples. Important aspects of their data, shown in Fig. 10.5a and b, include: (1) a broad range of d114/110Cd for particulates in vehicle exhaust; (2) the tendency of organic-associated materials such as fuel oil and coal to have positive d66/64Zn; and (3) the positive d53/52Cr values of the coal combustion sam- ples, perhaps reﬂecting the particular redox history of the coal deposit. These data highlight the potential variability of the anthropogenic signal and show the utility of the multi-isotope approach. Although the inﬂuence of dust from deteriorating metal in scrapyards has yet to be rigorously quantiﬁed in terms of either metal ﬂux or stable isotope compo- sition, there is potentially an important isotope signal resulting from electroplating as noted above. Electro- plating is a ubiquitous process that can produce an isotopically light pool for all the transition and post- transition metals (e.g. Kavner et al. 2008), and recog- nition of light isotope compositions for a suite of metals such as Zn, Cd and Cr in a set of dust samples may point to such sources. Cadmium and Zn isotope compositions of an electroplated metal nut and Cr and Zn isotope compositions of an electroplated metal bolt, measured by the author, are included in Fig. 10.5a and b to illustrate the potential signal.194 T.D. Bullen

The obvious need to understand the potential inﬂuence of deteriorating electroplated metal stockpiles on the isotope composition of atmospheric dust, perhaps mostly to monitor the global transport of potentially toxic metals, makes this an important avenue for future research. 4.2 Metal Redox Cycles The common association of changes in redox status of the transition and post-transition metals with isotopefractionation between oxidized and reduced states points to the potentially powerful application of the isotopes as tracers of redox cycles in natural sys- tems. Isotopes can be used, for example, to distinguish between biological and geochemical processes, such as microbial reduction and inorganic oxidation, and physical processes, such as advective mixing and dif- fusion, to explain chemical and isotopic composition gradients in hydrologic systems. Teutsch et al. (2009) used Fe isotopes to study the Fe cycle across the oxic-anoxic boundary of mero- mictic Lake Nyos, Cameroon, the site of a sudden catastrophic release of CO 2in 1986 that killed about 1,700 people. To avoid the recurrence of catastrophic outgassing of CO 2that is supplied by groundwater to the lake bottom, the lake is now artiﬁcially degassed by a tube that drains deep water to the surface (Kling et al. 2005). The degassing system spreads deep water with concentrations of dissolved Fe(II) in a high jet over the lake, causing immediate oxidation of the Fe (II) to Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide particulate which then settles into the lake. Concentrations of dissolved Fe(II) in the oxic surface waters are negligible, but sharply increase as particles settle across the oxic- anoxic boundary at depth. Partial reduction of the Fe(III)-rich particles at this boundary releases Fe(II) to solution, which then diffuses upwards into the oxic zone where it is re-oxidized to form Fe(III)- oxyhydroxides which settle back to the oxic-anoxic boundary, and the cycle continues. Depth proﬁles sampled in the lake revealed a sharp increase in both dissolved Fe(II) concentrations andd57/54Fe values in a thin zone across the oxic- anoxic boundary. Using a calibrated one dimensional reaction-transport model that considered the isotopic signatures of dissolved Fe(II) and the settling of Fe (III)-rich particles, the settling ﬂuxes of the particles and the dissolved Fe(II) concentration proﬁles, Teutsch et al. (2009) showed that the sharp increase ind57/54Fe values is caused by isotopic fractionation associated with dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction across the oxic-anoxic boundary. They further showed that the continued shift toward even greater d57/54Fe values below the oxic-anoxic boundary is due to vertical mixing of Fe–rich lake bottom water that has high- d57/54Fe values, perhaps due to precipitation of siderite. In this study, isotopic analyses coupled to modeling proved invaluable for identifying the Fig. 10.5 (a) Cd-Zn and ( b) Cr-Zn isotope systematics of suspected sources of metals in dust from northern France. Mea- surements were made on acid leachates of particles collected at municipal waste incinerators and coal combustion plants, from vehicle exhaust pipe ﬁlters, on acid leachates of plated nuts and bolts, and on total digests of fuels.

processes responsible for the broad range of d57/54Fe values observed in this lake. Isotopes can likewise be used to assess paleoredox conditions in water bodies, for example by looking at variations of the redox-sensitive Mo isotope composi- tion of sediments. In oxic settings, Mo isotopes are fractionated during adsorption of Mo to ferroman- ganese oxides, with light isotopes preferentially associated with the solids. Experimental work under oxidizing conditions has shown that d97/95Mo of aque- ous Mo in seawater is 2.7 ‰greater than that of adsorbed Mo on sediment (Barling et al. 2001; Barling and Anbar 2004; Wasylenki et al. 2008). As waters progress from oxic to suboxic to anoxic to euxinic (i.e. sulﬁdic) conditions, MoO 42-is converted to MoS 42-which readily adsorbs to particles allowing aqueous Mo to be more effectively removed to the sediment (Poulson et al. 2006; Neubert et al. 2008). The net result is that the isotopic contrast between aqueous and sorbed Mo is greatest at slightly reducing conditions and low sedimentation rates, but decreases with increasingly reducing and sulﬁdic conditions due to increasingly more quantitative removal of Mo from solution. This concept was used by Siebert et al. (2006) to account for differences in the average Mo isotope composition of sediment proﬁles from continental mar- gin settings. These workers recognized a co-variation between the Mo isotope composition of the sediments and the rate of both authigenic Mo accumulation and organic carbon oxidation and burial under reducing conditions. Malinovsky et al. (2007) tried the same approach to understand paleoredox cycles in lakes from northern Sweden and northwestern Russia, where variations of Mo isotope composition in the sediments could be attributed to both redox status of the water column and isotopically variable input of Mo into the lakes due to Mo isotopic heterogeneity of bedrock in the drainage basins. This latter study points to the need for rigorous source term characterization, particularly as study site size decreases from global to local scale. An area of applied research where transition and post-transition metal stable isotopes are increasingly being used is to understand sedimentary and low tem- perature hydrothermal metal redox cycling, where both inorganic and biological redox processes can cause isotope fractionation. For example, Asael et al. (2007) used Cu stable isotopes to understand Cu redox cycling and mass transfer functions during sequentialcycles of low temperature alteration of igneous copper porphyries, marine sedimentary diagenesis and epige- netic mobilization of Cu in sandstones at a site of historic Cu mining in southern Israel. As predicted by theory and experiment, they found that d65/63Cu values of Cu(I)-sulﬁdes in the stratiform sediment- hosted Cu deposits are signiﬁcantly lower than those of coexisting Cu(II)-carbonates and hydroxides. Cou- pling the Cu isotope composition of the minerals to a mass balance model revealed that the main Cu reser- voir of the ore body is a sandstone-shale sequence and that the importance of Cu-sulﬁde reservoirs is small, consistent with ﬁeld observations. Thus most of the Cu transport occurred in relatively oxidized conditions, the knowledge of which provides a novel tool for exploration in the future. 4.3 Plant Nutrition and Processes Within Plants Numerous transition and post-transition metals play important chemical roles in plant nutrition (Marschner 1995). For example, of the metals discussed in this chapter, Fe is essential for chlorophyll development and function, assists in energy transfer functions and redox reactions, is an important constituent of enzymes and participates in nitrogen ﬁxation. Zinc is important for carbohydrate and protein metabolism, pollen formation, and general disease resistance, and is a structural constituent or regulatory co-factor of numerous plant enzymes. Molybdenum, Cu and Ni each play additional important physiological roles in plant nutrition, while excesses can lead to a variety of toxic effects on plant vitality. Using the stable iso- topes of these metals as indicators of metal sources and cycling processes, and perhaps to reveal the onset of metal toxicity, is an emerging ﬁeld in isotope biogeoscience. As pointed out by von Blanckenburg et al. (2009), the metabolic processes that control the behavior of metals in plants can be envisaged as a gigantic geochemical pump that continuously moves metals between reservoirs. As plants move metals from soils into roots and along the transpiration stream, the metals are cycled through a variety of chemical spe- cies via processes that can lead to isotope196 T.D. Bullen

fractionation. During the past several years, for the metals discussed here stable isotope fractionation in higher plants has been demonstrated for Fe and Zn (Weiss et al. 2005; Guelke and von Blanckenburg 2007; Viers et al. 2007; Moynier et al. 2008; Kiczka et al. 2010). This is an intriguing pair of metals to consider, as the isotope fractionations observed in plants are largely controlled by redox status for Fe, and by complexation chemistry for Zn. Plants have developed two different strategies for transporting Fe from soils into roots. Roots of dicotyledons and nongraminaceous monocotyledons (“strategy I plants”, e.g. pea, bean) release protons into the rhizosphere, promoting dissolution of Fe(III) precipitates, and activating membrane-bound enzymes that reduce chelate-bound Fe(III). The reduced Fe is then transported across the root plasma membrane by unspeciﬁc metal transporters (Briat et al. 2007). Partial reduction of an Fe(III)-solid produces aqueous Fe(II) with an56Fe/54Fe ratio that is approximately 1–1.5 ‰ less than that in the remaining Fe(III)-solid (Johnson et al. 2004). As a consequence, the Fe(II) that crosses the root plasma membrane, and thus the pool of Fe in a strategy I plant, is lighter than the soil Fe pool. In contrast, roots of graminaceous plant species (“strategy II plants”, e.g. maize, wheat) can release phytosiderophores into the rhizosphere, which form complexes with Fe(III) (Romheld and Marschner 1986; Kraemer et al. 2006). These Fe(III)-complexes are then transported across the root plasma membrane by a specialized class of transport proteins, but due tolack of reduction, the pool of Fe(III) in a strategy II plant has the same Fe isotope composition as the soil Fe pool. The results of two studies of Fe isotope variability in plants are shown in Fig. 10.6. In a variety of strategy I plants studied by Guelke and von Blanckenburg (2007), d56/54Fe values of tissues decreased from soils to stems, from stems to leaves and from leaves to seeds. In contrast, all tissues in their strategy II plants had similar d56/54Fe values, which they attrib- uted to differences in the way that Fe is translocated in the two plant types. These results are consistent with the different Fe uptake and transport processes pro- posed above for strategy I and strategy II plants. Kiczka et al. (2010), working with strategy I and II plants collected from a recently deglaciated site, iden- tiﬁed several reaction points along the translocation stream of both plant types where Fe(III) reduction and thus isotope fractionation might occur, including between the root symplast and apoplast, between the leaf cytoplasm and the xylem, and between the phloem and the leaf cytoplasm, at each step moving lighter Fe along the transpiration stream. However, in contrast to the results of Guelke and von Blanckenburg (2007), Kiczka et al. (2010) observed similar Fe isotope pat- terns in their strategy I and II plants, with d56/54Fe values generally increasing from root stele to stem to leaf. To explain this discrepancy, they pointed to previous studies suggesting that release of sidero- phores by strategy II plants into the rhizosphere is suppressed under Fe-rich soil conditions similar to Fig. 10.6 d56/54Fe values for a variety of plant tissues. Values for lettuce and soybean (Strategy I) and wheat (Strategy II) are from Guelke and von Blanckenburg (2007), values for oxyria digya and rumex scutatus (Strategy I) and agrostis givantea (Strategy II) are from Kiczka et al. (2010). In each diagram, the arrows between root tissues point from cortex to stele, anddemonstrate the large Fe isotope fractionation that occurs across the plasma membrane. Complex Fe isotope variations within individual plants result from a variety of possible isotope frac- tionation processes which can occur along the transpiration stream10 Stable Isotopes of Transition and Post-Transition Metals as Tracers in Environmental Studies 197

those at their ﬁeld site (Marschner 1995), and suggest- ing that strategy I and II plants mobilize and transport Fe similarly under such conditions (Charlson and Shoemaker 2006). In the case of Zn, dissolution of Fe(III) solids in the soil by protons released from plant roots results in release of Zn that is adsorbed on the Fe(III) solids. Subsequent uptake of Zn by roots depends only on the induction of speciﬁc Zn transporters, which belong to the same protein family as the Fe transporters (Kramer et al. 2007). Likewise, the release of phytosidero- phores beneﬁts the acquisition of Zn (Suzuki et al. 2006). Apparently the transport of Fe and Zn to plant roots is closely linked. Zn isotope variability within plants appears to be fairly straightforward and similar for strategy I and strategy II plants, based on several laboratory and ﬁeld based studies (Weiss et al. 2005; Viers et al. 2007; Moynier et al. 2008). Roots tend have the heaviest Zn, probably reﬂecting the preferen- tial adsorption of heavy Zn onto the root and plaque surfaces. However it should be noted that the possibil- ity of Zn isotope contrast between the root cortex and stele of plants has yet to be explored, as has been done for Fe isotopes (Kiczka et al. 2010). Shoots have similar to lesser d66/64Zn values than bulk roots, and leaves invariably contain the lightest Zn in the plants. These observations are consistent with light Zn iso- topes being transported preferentially during nutrient exchange along the cell walls of the xylem although it is unclear at this stage whether this is a kinetic or an equilibrium process (von Blanckenburg et al. 2009). There clearly remains much to be done to under- stand the causes of transition and post-transition metal stable isotope fractionation in plants, and certainly the remaining metals deserve at least a thorough recon- naissance for a variety of plant species and ﬁeld situations. To date, much of the work has aimed at explaining observed variations of isotope composition in terms of known plant processes. With greater under- standing, future work will gradually shift toward using the isotopes to identify as yet unknown or uncon- strained processes in plants. 4.4 Biosignatures One of the most enduring hopes and goals of metal stable isotope biogeochemistry is to be able to use the isotopes as biosignatures, by developing either singleor multi-tracer tests that could be applied to a natural system to decipher a biological inﬂuence on its origins. A recurring theme in metal stable isotope studies of biological systems is that biological activities that result in signiﬁcant isotope fractionation generally involve preferential processing of lighter isotopes from the metal source pool into and within the biological materi- als (e.g. Zhu et al. 2002; Bermin et al. 2006; Johnson et al. 2008; Eisenhauer et al. 2009). Indeed, in the early days of the transition and post-transition metal stable isotope data explosion (i.e. the late 1990s), the general thinking was that most metal stable isotope fraction- ation observed in nature would be due to biological processing (e.g. Beard and Johnson 1999). This think- ing led to pioneering attempts to constrain experimen- tally an Fe isotope biosignature (Beard et al. 1999), but likewise inspired early attempts to demonstrate the importance of inorganic processes that could fractionate Fe isotopes both in the laboratory (e.g. Anbar et al. 2000) and in natural settings (e.g. Bullen et al. 2001). We now realize that ranges of metal stable isotope fractionation caused by inorganic processes can exceed and overlap those produced by biological processing, making development of robust metal stable isotope biosignature tools a challenge but also an exceptional research opportunity. Given the early and persistent focus on the isotope systematics of Fe, it is not surprising that the greatest progress toward development of a metal stable isotope biosignature has been for Fe, at least for early Earth environments. As stressed by Johnson et al. (2008), the ﬂuxes of mobilized Fe must have been far greater in the Archean and early Proterozoic because of the enormous amount of Fe-rich sediments (e.g. banded iron formations) that were deposited in that time span. The Fe isotope compostion of those sediments is highly variable compared to igneous rocks, implying that the processes responsible for fractionating Fe must have been especially active and variable in extent during that time span. Because microbial dissimilatory Fe reduction (DIR) appears to be the most important process capable of producing large quantities of isoto- pically light Fe, by an order of magnitude or more compared to inorganic processes, DIR is likely to have been the dominant process affecting Fe during that time span. In this case, the effectiveness of the Fe isotope biosignature depended on knowledge of the relative sizes of the reduced and oxidized Fe pools during early198 T.D. Bullen

Earth history. If we are going to be able to use Fe isotopes to detect a record of DIR in other environ- ments (e.g. in the search for life on Mars and other planetary bodies), we must be able to assess the size of those pools in those environments as well. Conﬁdence in the approach will increase as more terrestrial ﬁeld sites are studied. A promising example from modern Earth comes from the work of Severmann et al. (2008), who used Fe isotopes to support their conten- tion that DIR coupled to Fe(II) oxidation in oxic shelf sediments can account for the large amount of isotopi- cally light Fe produced on the shelf and shuttled to the euxinic basin of the Black Sea. Biosignatures based on the other transition and post- transition metal isotope systems have yet to be explored as deeply as that based on Fe, but there are promising signs for success. For example, Borrok et al. (2008) documented a diel cycle for dissolved Zn concentra- tions and d66/64Zn values in Prickly Pear Creek, which drains a former mining district in the Boulder Batholith, Montana, USA. They found that dissolved Zn concen- trations and d66/64Zn values were inversely correlated, with Zn at low concentrations in the daytime having elevated d66/64Zn due to sequestration of light Zn in bed sediments. Biological uptake of light Zn was invoked to explain this relationship, since adsorption of Zn onto amorphous Fe(III) oxides prevalent in bed sediments preferentially concentrates heavy Zn onto sorption sites (Balistrieri et al. 2008). As discussed above, Cameron et al. (2009) demonstrated that methanogenic bacteria cultured in the laboratory preferentially assimilate and retain isotopically light Ni, while a wide range of geo- logic materials have uniform Ni isotope composition. Nickel isotopes are thus likely to become an important biosignature of methanogenesis. And, as pointed out by von Blanckenburg et al. (2009), plant tissues recycled into soil generally have different metal stable isotope composition than the growth medium, thus the upper soil may retain a time-integrated metal isotope ﬁngerprint of plant activity. New biosignatures are likely to emerge as well understood biological systems are studied. 5 Future Directions As pointed out by Severmann and Anbar (2009), the ﬁeld of metal stable isotope biogeochemistry emerged primarily as an analytical pursuit driven by advances in mass spectrometry applied to interesting geologicalmaterials. Arguably, much of the work that has been done to date with the transition and post-transition metal stable isotopes has resulted in a better under- standing of the isotope systems themselves rather than the materials that have been measured. Many observed variations in isotope composition have been explained in terms of well understood physical, chemical and biological processes, but isotope analyses have so far rarely revealed some unanticipated or poorly under- stood set of processes. On the other hand, useful applications pertinent to environmental studies are beginning to emerge: isotopic characteristics of plant homeostasis are being established, multi-tracer approaches for identifying metal sources are being developed, biosignatures are being rigorously con- strained through analysis of well understood geo- logical and biological materials, and the isotopic signatures of redox reactions are being characterized. As understanding of metal stable isotope systematics increases, it will become easier to think of novel ways that isotopes can enhance understanding of complex processes in environmental systems. What should be clear from this chapter is that the ﬁeld of transition and post-transition metal stable isotope biogeochemistry is really just beginning to mature, and that opportunities are abundant. Major advances over the next several years are likely to include: improving the routine precision and reproduc- ibility of total procedural replicate measurements of samples to the few hundredths of a per mil level; developing robust multi-tracer approaches to identify metal sources and pathways for forensic purposes; looking for the unexpected isotope fractionation of metals such as Ti and Ni in environmental systems; expanding the list of robust biosignatures, including the ﬁngerprint of anthropogenic activities; exploring the metal stable isotope signals of global climate change.
