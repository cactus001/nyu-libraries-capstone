The U.S. Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Interior (DOI) were asked by Congress to develo p long-term plans to ad dress incarceration in Indian Country and alternatives to incarceration. We have furthe r enhanced the plan to include offender reentry. We appreciate and thank all those who commented on and helped to finalize the Tribal Justice Plan.
