73048 CFR Ch. 1 (10 –1–02 Edition) 36.606 disclosed except as permitted by agen- cy regulations. [48 FR 42356, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 62 FR 44829, Aug. 22, 1997] 606 Negotiations. (a) Unless otherwise specified by the selection authority, the final selection authorizes the contracting officer to begin negotiations. Negotiations shall be conducted in accordance with part 15 of this chapter, beginning with the most preferred firm in the final selec-tion (see 15.404 –4(c)(4)(i) on fee limita- tion). (b) The contracting officer should or- dinarily request a proposal from the firm, ensuring that the solicitation does not inadvertently preclude the firm from proposing the use of modern design methods. (c) The contracting officer shall in- form the firm that no construction contract may be awarded to the firm that designed the project, except as provided in 36.209. (d) During negotiations, the con- tracting officer should seek advance agreement (see 31.109) on any charges for computer-assisted design. When the firm’s proposal does not cover appro- priate modern and cost-effective design methods (e.g., computer-assisted de-sign), the contracting officer should discuss this topic with the firm. (e) Because selection of firms is based upon qualifications, the extent of any subcontracting is an important nego-tiation topic. The clause prescribed at 44.204(b), Subcontractors and Outside Associates and Consultants (Architect-Engineer Services) (see 52.244 –4), limits a firm ’s subcontracting to firms agreed upon during negotiations. (f) If a mutually satisfactory con- tract cannot be negotiated, the con-tracting officer shall obtain a written final proposal revision from the firm, and notify the firm that negotiations have been terminated. The contracting officer shall then initiate negotiations with the next firm on the final selec-tion list. This procedure shall be con-tinued until a mutually satisfactory contract has been negotiated. If nego-tiations fail with all selected firms, the contracting officer shall refer the mat-ter to the selection authority who, after consulting with the contracting officer as to why a contract cannot be negotiated, may direct the evaluation board to recommend additional firms in accordance with 36.602.

(a) After final selection has taken place, the contracting officer may re-lease information identifying only the architect-engineer firm with which a contract will be negotiated for certain work. The work should be described in any release only in general terms, un-less information relating to the work is classified. If negotiations are termi-nated without awarding a contract to the highest rated firm, the contracting officer may release that information and state that negotiations will be un-dertaken with another (named) archi-tect-engineer firm. When an award has been made, the contracting officer may release award information, (see 5.401). (b) Debriefings of successful and un- successful firms will be held after final selection has taken place and will be conducted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with 15.503, 15.506(b) through (f), 15.507(c). Note that 15.506(d)(2) through (d)(5) do not apply to architect-engineer contracts.

Architect-engineer contractors shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and co-ordination of all services required under their contracts. A firm may be liable for Government costs resulting from errors or deficiencies in designs furnished under its contract. There-fore, when a modification to a con-struction contract is required because of an error or deficiency in the services provided under an architect-engineer contract, the contracting officer (with the advice of technical personnel and legal counsel) shall consider the extent VerDate 0ct<31>2002 01:10 Dec 05, 2002 Jkt 197193 PO 00000 Frm 00730 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\197193T.XXX 197193T

731Federal Acquisition Regulation 36.609 –3 to which the architect-engineer con- tractor may be reasonably liable. The contracting officer shall enforce the li-ability and collect the amount due, if the recoverable cost will exceed the ad-ministrative cost involved or is other-wise in the Government ’s interest. The contracting officer shall include in the contract file a written statement of the reasons for the decision to recover or not to recover the costs from the firm. 609 Contract clauses.36.609 –1 Design within funding limita- tions. (a) The Government may require the architect-engineer contractor to design the project so that construction costs will not exceed a contractually speci-fied dollar limit (funding limitation). If the price of construction proposed in response to a Government solicitation exceeds the construction funding limi-tation in the architect-engineer con-tract, the firm shall be solely respon-sible for redesigning the project within the funding limitation. These addi-tional services shall be performed at no increase in the price of this contract. However, if the cost of proposed con-struction is affected by events beyond the firm ’s reasonable control (e.g., if there is an increase in material costs which could not have been anticipated, or an undue delay by the Government in issuing a construction solicitation), the firm shall not be obligated to rede-sign at no cost to the Government. If a firm’s design fails to meet the contrac- tual limitation on construction cost and the Government determines that the firm should not redesign the project, a written statement of the rea-sons for that determination shall be placed in the contract file. (b) The amount of the construction funding limitation (to be inserted in paragraph (c) of the clause at 52.236 –22) is to be established during negotiations between the contractor and the Gov-ernment. This estimated construction contract price shall take into account any statutory or other limitations and exclude any allowances for Govern-ment supervision and overhead and any amounts set aside by the Government for contingencies. In negotiating the amount, the contracting officer should make available to the contractor the information upon which the Govern-ment has based its initial construction estimate and any subsequently ac-quired information that may affect the construction costs. (c) The contracting officer shall in- sert the clause at 52.236 –22, Design Within Funding Limitations, in fixed-price architect-engineer contracts ex-cept when (1) the head of the con-tracting activity or a designee deter-mines in writing that cost limitations are secondary to performance consider-ations and additional project funding can be expected, if necessary, (2) the design is for a standard structure and is not intended for a specific location, or (3) there is little or no design effort involved. [48 FR 42356, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 50 FR 26903, June 28, 1985] 609 –2 Redesign responsibility for design errors or deficiencies. (a) Under architect-engineer con- tracts, contractors shall be required to make necessary corrections at no cost to the Government when the designs, drawings, specifications, or other items or services furnished contain any er-rors, deficiencies, or inadequacies. If, in a given situation, the Government does not require a firm to correct such errors, the contracting officer shall in-clude a written statement of the rea-sons for that decision in the contract file. (b) The contracting officer shall in- sert the clause at 52.236 –23, Responsi- bility of the Architect-Engineer Con-tractor, in fixed-price architect-engi-neer contracts. [48 FR 42356, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 50 FR 26903, June 28, 1985] 609 –3 Work oversight in architect- engineer contracts. The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.236 –24, Work Oversight in Architect-Engineer Contracts, in all architect-engineer contracts.
