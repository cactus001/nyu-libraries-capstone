Equations for the static stresses resulting from deflection and static pressure in a flexible line operating in the elastic material range may be found in references 2, 3, 4, and 5. Flexible lines, by definition, must be flexible and capable of accommodating deflections across its length. Because of this, many flexible lines operate in the non- linear (plastic) material range. This phenomenon increases the difficulty of the analysis and requires that good engineering judgement and analysis procedures be used to assure that all loading effects are accounted for. The following are some items to be considered in performing a plastic analysis: A. A computer code capable of including large displacement and non-linear material effects will be needed. This is necessary to determine the stress field along the meridian and through the wall thickness of the flexible line. Plastic behavior of the material would be expected in the inner radius of the convolutes at the root and crown.

Therefore, the modulus of elasticity needs to be adjusted. This must be considered when calculating strains due to dynamic stresses. One factor which may be used to adjust the elastic modulus is the ratio of the spring rate of the flexible line consistent with the configuration of the line when the stresses occur, versus the spring rate of the flexible line in the undeflected condition. E. The change in material modulus when yielding occurs will affect the response of the flexible line to the flow.

This program is written to apply to both liquid and gas flows through a metal bellows. In the case of gas flows, it also calculates the first radial acoustic mode frequency and velocity. This program, however, does not conduct flow-induced vibration analysis for a flexhose and does not calculate static stresses in a bellows. . The flexhose and static stress analysis have to be done by hand. This computer program takes into account the uncertainty factors and acoustic factor for flow-induced stress. The output values for flow-induced stress have the appropriate uncertainty factors and acoustic factor already applied. 1 APFROVAL . The computer program gives the user the option of inputing the data from the keyboard or from a data file. An example of an input data file is given in paragraph 1.2. The output data can be saved in a data file or sent to a printer.

THIS PROGRAM APPLIES TO BOTH LIQUID AND GAS FLOWS. IN THE CASE OF GAS FLOWS, MODE FREQUENCY AND VELOCITY. THIS PROGRAM, HOWEVER, DOES NOT CONDUCT FLOW-INDUCED VIBRATION ANALYSIS FOR A FLEXHOSE AND DOES NOT CALCULATE STATIC STRESSES IN A BELLOWS. IT ALSO CALCüLATES THE FIRST RADIAL ACOUSTIC THIS PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN TO OPERATE ON AN IBM-XT COMPUTER WITH A FORTRAN COMPILER WRITTEN BY RYAN-MCFARLAND CORPORATION. THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS ARE USED: JFLAG = l(C0MPUTE KA), 2(USE GIVEN KA). KA IS THE OVERALL NFLUID = l(GAS), Z(L1QUID) NC = NUMBER OF BELLOWS CONVOLUTES COUNTED FROM THE OUTSIDE SIGMA = INSIDE CONVOLUTE WIDTH, IN. LAMBDA = INSIDE CONVOLUTE PITCH, IN. L H = MEAN INSIDE CONVOLUTE HEIGHT, IN. T = CONVOLUTE THICKNESS PER PLY, IN. I NPLY = NUMBER OF PLYS IN THE BELLOWS CONVOLUTES DI = BELLOWS INSIDE DIAMETER, IN. l Do = BELLOWS OUTSIDE DIAMETER, IN. E = YOUNG'S MODULUS OF THE BELLQWS MATERIAL, LB/SQ IN. RHOM = WEIGHT DENSITY OF THE BELLOWS MATERIAL, LBF/CU IN. LOVERD = LENGTH FROM TERMINATION OF ELBOW TO FIRST CONVOLUTE CE = DIMENSIONLESS ELBOW FACTOR IF NFLUID = l(GAS), THE PERFECT GAS EQUATION OF STATE IS USED BELLOWS SPRING RATE, LBF/IN NDEG = NUMBER OF BELLOWS LONGITUDINAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM, 2*NC-1 i c DIVIDED BY THE I.D. OF PIPE JUST BEFORE THE BELLOW, NON-DIM. FOR CALCULATING GAS DENSITY AT THE STATE DEFINED BY P AND TEMP. IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE GAS PROPERTIES ARE KNOWN AT A REFERENCE STATE DEFINED BY RHOREF, PREF, AND TREF. P = GAS PRESSURE, PSIG TEMP = GAS TEMPERATURE, DEG. F. PREF AND TREF = REFERENCE GAS STATE, PSIA AND DEG. F. RHOREF = UEIGHT DENSITY OF GAS AT REFERENCE STATE, LBF/cU FT. 2 = GAS COMPRESSIBILITY FACTOR, NON-DIM. ZREF = GAS COMPRESSIBILITY FACTOR AT REFERENCE STATE, GAMMA = SPECIFIC HEAT RATIO FOR THE GAS, IF NFUJID = 2(LIQUID), THE LIQUID DENSITY MUST BE KNOWN APRIORI AT THE LIQUID STATE (P AND TEMP). P = LIQUID PRESSURE, PSIG TEMP = LIQUID TEMPERA-, DEG. F. RHOF = WEIGHT DENSITY OF LIQUID AT P AND TEMP, LBF/CU FT. NON-DIM. NON-DIM. ..................................
