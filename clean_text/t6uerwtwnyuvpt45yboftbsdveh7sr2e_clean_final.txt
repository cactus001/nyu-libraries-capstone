2Farnan, District Judge. Pending before the Court is a Motion To Renew Motion Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 And For Leave To Amend Motion Under 28 U.S.C. §2255 (D.I. 200) filed by Defendant, Thomas E. Flaherty. For thereasons set forth below, the Court will grant Defendant’s MotionTo Renew his Section 2255 Motion (D.I. 200), grant Defendant’sMotion For Leave To Amend his Section 2255 Motion (D.I. 200) anddeny Defendant’s Amended Section 2255 Motion (D.I. 189, 200). BACKGROUND On November 15, 1990, Defendant was indicted on various drug charges. Following a jury trial, Defendant was convicted of twocharges, conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21U.S.C. § 846 and distribution of cocaine in violation of 21U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) and 18 U.S.C. § 2. On November15, 1991, Defendant was sentenced to 360 months imprisonment torun concurrently on the two charges. In sentencing Defendant,the Court concluded that Defendant was a “career offender”pursuant to Section 4B1.1 of the United States SentencingGuidelines (the “Guidelines”). The Court based its determinationupon Defendant’s previous convictions for a crime of violence anda controlled substance offense. On April 14, 1997, Defendant filed a Section 2255 Motion. (D.I. 189). By his Motion, Defendant sought to collaterallyattack a state court conviction that had been used to enhance his

1Defendant filed a Motion For Expansion Of Time (D.I. 205) to file a Reply Brief. However, Section 2255 and the RulesGoverning Section 2255 Proceedings do not contemplate the filing 3federal sentence under Section 4B1.1 of the Guidelines. In his Motion, Defendant indicated that he had a state court collateralchallenge pending and that he filed his Section 2255 motion topreserve his right to seek Section 2255 relief if he wassuccessful in his state court proceedings. Thereafter, the Court ordered Defendant to advise the Court of the status of his motion for state post-conviction relief.(D.I. 193). Defendant filed a letter in response to the Courtindicating that the motion was denied without a hearing, but anappeal was filed. Defendant represented that, as of November1998, his appeal was still pending in the state court system. Although several months transpired, the Court received no further updates on the progress of Defendant’s appeal. As aresult, the Court denied Defendant’s pending Section 2255 Motionwith leave to renew upon the disposition of Defendant’s statecourt action. (D.I. 198). Shortly thereafter, Defendant filedthe instant Motion renewing his Section 2255 Motion and seekingto amend the Motion to add a claim under Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U.S. 466 (2000). The Government has filed a response to Defendant’s Renewed Section 2255 Motion and his Motion For Leave To Amend. (D.I.204). 1 Accordingly, the instant Motion is ripe for the Court’s

of a traverse by the movant in response to the Government’s answer, except in special circumstances. In this case, the Courtfinds that the issues are straightforward and capable ofresolution on the record currently before the Court. As such,the Court concludes that a traverse by Defendant is notwarranted, and therefore, Defendant’s Motion For Expansion OfTime will be denied. See e.g. United States v. Sanchez , 2002 WL 465297 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 21, 2002) (denying defendant’s request forleave to file a traverse where issues were straightforward andcapable of being resolved on the record before the court). 4review. DISCUSSION I. Defendant’s Motion To Amend His Section 2255 Motion To Include An Apprendi Claim In renewing his previously filed Section 2255 Motion, Defendant seeks to amend his Motion to include a claim that hissentence was invalid under Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U.S. 466 (2000). In determining whether Defendant should be permitted to amend his original Section 2255 Motion to add an Apprendi claim, the Court must consider Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of CivilProcedure. Riley v. Taylor , 62 F.3d 86, 89 (3d Cir. 1995). Rule 15(a) provides that a party may amend his pleading once as amatter of course any time before a responsive pleading is filed. When amendment as a matter of course is not permitted, a partymay amend his pleadings by obtaining leave of court, which shouldbe freely given. Relying on United States v. Duffus , 174 F.3d 333, 337-338 (3d Cir.), cert. denied , 528 U.S. 866 (1999), the Government

--- Page 4 ---
5opposes Defendant’s Motion To Amend on the ground that his amendment does not relate back to his original claims, but addsan entirely new claim. However, the Duffus decision relied on that portion of Rule 15 requiring leave of court to amend. Inthis case, however, it appears to the Court that Defendant soughtto add his Apprendi claim prior to the time that the Government filed its responsive pleading. As such, Defendant was permittedto amend his petition as a matter of course to advance anApprendi claim. Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendant’s Motion For Leave To Amend his Section 2255 Motion. II. Defendant’s Amended Section 2255 Motion A. Defendant’s Apprendi Claim By his renewed Section 2255 Motion, Defendant contends that his sentence is invalid under Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U.S. 466 (2000). Specifically, Defendant contends that he wasconvicted of two drug counts that did not specify the amount ofcocaine and that he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment thatexceeded the statutory maximum in violation of Apprendi . In Apprendi , the United States Supreme Court held that “[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact thatincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutorymaximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond areasonable doubt.” Id. at 490. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has recently concluded that Apprendi does not apply

--- Page 5 ---
6retroactively to cases on collateral review. In re Turner , 267 F.3d 225, 231 (3d Cir. 2001) (joining majority view that Apprendi is not retroactive); United States v. Robinson , 2001 WL 840231 (D. Del. Jul. 20, 2001) (Farnan, J.) (collecting cases). Accordingly, the Court concludes that Defendant is not entitledto relief on his Apprendi claim. In the alternative, however, even if the Supreme Court were to subsequently make Apprendi retroactive to cases on collateral review, the Court would conclude, as a substantive matter, thatDefendant has failed to establish a claim for a violation ofApprendi . In this case, Defendant was convicted of two drug counts that did not specify the quantity of drugs. As such, themandatory minimum provisions of Section 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)were not invoked. Rather, Defendant was sentenced in accordancewith 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) and 21 U.S.C. § 851, because he hada prior drug conviction. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C),Defendant was subject to a maximum period of incarceration of 30years imprisonment on each count. In this case, Defendant wassentenced to thirty years imprisonment to run concurrently onboth of his convictions. Because Defendant’s sentence did notexceed the statutory maximum penalty that he was subject to as aresult of his prior conviction, the Court concludes thatDefendant cannot establish a violation of Apprendi . United States v. Pressler , 256 F.3d 144, 159 (3d Cir. 2001); United

--- Page 6 ---
7States v. Butch , 256 F.3d 171, 180 (3d Cir. 2001) (requiring under first prong of Apprendi inquiry that defendant’s sentence exceed the “prescribed statutory maximum”); see also United States v. Combs , 267 F.3d 1167, 1180-1181 (10th Cir. 2001) (“Apprendi does not require us to reverse where a sentence is equal to the statutory maximum.”). Accordingly, the Court willdismiss Defendant’s claim that his sentence violated Apprendi . B. Defendant’s Claim That He Was Sentenced Based On A Constitutionally Invalid Prior Conviction In renewing his Section 2255 Motion, Defendant also requests the Court to adjudicate the claim he initially advanced, i.e.that his sentence was enhanced by a prior state court convictionin Massachusetts that is constitutionally invalid. (D.I. 189).In his renewed Motion and attached affidavit, Defendant does notexpand on this claim other than to inform the court of thedisposition of his collateral attack. Specifically, Defendantstates that he was unsuccessful in pursuing his collateral attackin the Massachusetts appellate court. As for his appeal to theMassachusetts Supreme Court, Defendant contends that his appealwas rejected because it was not properly formatted and hiscounsel did not submit a corrected application. (D.I. 200,Flaherty Aff. at ¶¶ 1-4). The United States Supreme Court has held that a defendant cannot collaterally attack a previous state court conviction usedto enhance a federal sentence through a federal Section 2255

--- Page 7 ---
2Defendant has not informed the Court of the grounds upon which he challenged his prior state court conviction ineither his original Section 2255 Motion or his renewed Motion,but Defendant has acknowledged that he “has no valid grounds tobase his section 2255 motion unless he receives a favorable decision in the state court either modifying or vacating thestate conviction used to enhance his federal sentence.” (D.I.189 at 6) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the Court doesnot believe that the Gideon exception applies in this case. Further, because Defendant has not provided the Court with anyinformation about his state court conviction, the Court does notbelieve Defendant is trying to use the instant Section 2255Motion to substantively attack that conviction. 8proceeding. Daniels v. United States , 532 U.S. 374, 382-383 (2001). This rule applies to all federal constitutionalchallenges to the state court conviction, except for a challengethat the conviction was obtained in violation of the SixthAmendment right to court-appointed counsel established in Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U.S. 335 (1963). Id. at 382. (“A defendant may challenge a prior conviction as the product of a Gideon violation, in a 2255 motion, but generally only if he raised thatclaim at his federal sentencing proceeding.”). 2 To challenge a state court conviction used to enhance a federal sentence, the defendant must pursue the remediesavailable for that conviction, i.e. direct appeal, post-conviction proceedings under state law and habeas corpus reliefpursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254. Id. at 381. If the defendant is successful in such a challenge, the defendant may then apply toreopen his federal sentence. Id. at 381-382. However, if the prior conviction is no longer open for direct or collateral

--- Page 8 ---
9attack because the defendant failed to pursue his remedies or was unsuccessful in pursing them, then the conviction ispresumptively valid and may be used to enhance the defendant’sfederal sentence. Id. Based on Defendant’s affidavit, it appears that he was unsuccessful in challenging the state court conviction used toenhance his federal sentence in the Massachusetts state courts. Should Defendant be successful at some point in the future inchallenging that conviction through Section 2254 proceedings orrenewed state court proceedings, he can petition the Court toreopen his federal sentence. At this point, however, Defendanthas not established that the state court conviction used toenhance his federal sentence was invalid. Accordingly, the Courtwill dismiss Defendant’s claim to the extent that it challengesthe state court conviction used to enhance his federal sentence. CONCLUSION For the reasons discussed, the Court will grant Defendant’s Motion To Renew his Section 2255 Motion, grant Defendant’s MotionFor Leave To Amend and deny Defendant’s Amended Section 2255Motion (D.I. 189, 200). An appropriate Order will be entered.
