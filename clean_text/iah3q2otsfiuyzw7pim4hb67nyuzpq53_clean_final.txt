February 11, 2009: Congressman Wittman Lauds Decision to Freeze Congressional Payraise (WASHINGTON, DC) - Tuesday, House Leaders announced that House members will not receive a pay raise in 2010. The Appropriations Committee has been instructed to include language in the fiscal year 2010 Legislative Branch appropriations bill that would block any pay increase for House members. &quot;I applaud House Leadership for finally listening to the American people. I do not believe that a congressional pay raise of any amount is appropriate at a time when our nation is at war and our federal budget deficit is rising,&quot; said Wittman. &quot;I believe that our nation's leaders have a duty to set a patriotic and responsible example, in my mind, increasing our own salaries when our military service personnel are still faced with a pay gap and American families are tightening their budgets is emphatically not part of that example,&quot; said Wittman. Wittman has been calling for the freeze for months and is a cosponsor H.R. 156 introduced by Rep. Harry Mitchell of Arizona. The legislation would eliminate automatic pay increases for Members of Congress. Under the terms of a 1989 law, members of Congress automatically receive an annual cost-of-living pay increase unless they act to stop it. The annual increases are based on a formula calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which takes into consideration changes in private industry wages and salaries. 1 / 1
