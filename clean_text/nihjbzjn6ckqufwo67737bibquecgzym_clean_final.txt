22Standard CRA Definitions and Common Abbreviations The following terms and abbreviations are used thr oughout this performance evaluation, including the CRA tables. The definitions are intended to provide the reader with a general understanding of the terms, not a strict legal definition. Affiliate: Any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another company. A company is under common control with another company if the same company directly or indirectly controls both companies. A bank subsidiary is controlled by the bank and is, therefore, an affiliate. Aggregate Lending: The number of loans originated and purchased by all reporting lenders in specified income categories as a percentage of the aggregate number of loans originated and purchased by all reporting lenders in the MA/assessment area. Block Numbering Area (BNA): A statistical subdivision of a county fo r grouping and numbering blocks in non- metropolitan counties where local censu s statistical area committees have not established census tracts. A BNA does not cross county lines. Census Tract (CT): A small subdivision of metropolitan and other densely populated counties. Census tract boundaries do not cross county lines; however, they may cross the boundaries of metropolitan statistical areas. Census tracts usually have between 2,500 and 8,000 persons, and their physical size varies widely depending upon population density. Census tracts are designe d to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living cond itions to allow for statistical comparisons. Community Development: Affordable housing (including multifamily rental housing) for low- or moderate- income individuals; community services targeted to low- or moderate-income individua ls; activities that promote economic development by financing businesses or farms that meet the size eligibility standards of the Small Business Administration’s Development Company or Small Business Investment Company programs (13 CFR 121.301) or have gross annual revenues of $1 million or less; or, activities that revitalize or stabilize low- or moderate-income geographies. Consumer Loan(s): A loan(s) to one or more individuals for hou sehold, family, or other personal expenditures. A consumer loan does not include a home mortgage, small business, or small farm loan. This definition includes the following categories: motor vehicle loans, credit card loans, home equity loans, other secured consumer loans, and other unsecured consumer loans. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): the statute that requires the OCC to evaluate a bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its local community, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank, and to take this record into account when evaluating certain corporate applications filed by the bank. Family: Includes a householder and one or more other pers ons living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. The num ber of family households always equals the number of families; however, a family household may also include non-relatives living with the family. Families are classified by type as either a married-couple family or other family, which is further classified into ‘male householder’ (a family with a male household and no wife present) or ‘female householder’ (a family with a female householder and no husband present). Full Review: Performance under the Lending, Investment, and Serv ice Tests is analyzed considering performance context, quantitative factors (e.g., geographic distributio n, borrower distribution, and total number and dollar amount of investments), and qualitative factors (e.g ., innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness).

--- Page 4 ---
33Geography: A census tract or a block numbering area delineated by the United States Bureau of the Census in the most recent decennial census. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA): The statute that requires certain mortgage lenders that do business or have banking offices in a metropolitan statistical area to file annual summary reports of their mortgage lending activity. The reports include such data as the race, gende r, and the income of applications, the amount of loan requested, and the disposition of the applica tion (e.g., approved, de nied, and withdrawn). Home Mortgage Loans: such loans include home purchase and home improvement loans, as defined in the HMDA regulation. This definition also includes loans for multifamily (five or more families) dwellings, loans for the purchase of manufactured homes and refinanci ng of home improvement and home purchase loans. Household: Includes all persons occupying a housing unit. Persons not living in households are classified as living in group quarters. In 100 percent tabulations, the count of households always equals the count of occupied housing units. Limited Review: Performance under the Lending, Investment, and Service Tests is analyzed using only quantitative factors (e.g., geographic distribution, borro wer distribution, total number and dollar amount of investments, and branch distribution). Low-Income: Individual income that is less than 50 percent of the area median income, or a median family income that is less than 50 per cent, in the case of a geography. Market Share: The number of loans originated and purchased by the institution as a percentage of the aggregate number of loans originated and purchased by all reporting lenders in the MA/assessment area. Median Family Income (MFI): The median income determined by the U. S. Census Bureau every ten years and used to determine the income level category of geog raphies. Also, the median income determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Deve lopment annually that is used to determine the income level category of individuals. For any given area, the median is the point at which half of the families have income above it and half below it. Metropolitan Area (MA): Any primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA), metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or consolidated metropolitan area (CMSA), as defi ned by the Office of Management and Budget, with a population of 250,000 or more, and any other area desi gnated as such by the appr opriate federal financial supervisory agency.

--- Page 5 ---
44Qualified Investment: A qualified investment is defined as any lawful investment, deposit, membership share, or grant that has as its primary purpose community development. Rated Area: A rated area is a state or multi-state metropolitan area. For an institution with domestic branches in only one state, the institution’s CRA rating would be the state rating. If an institution maintains domestic branches in more than one state, the institution will r eceive a rating for each state in which those branches are located. If an institution maintains domestic branches in two or more states within a multi-state metropolitan area, the institution will receive a rating for the multi-state metropolitan area. Small Loan(s) to Business(es): A loan included in 'loans to small bus inesses' as defined in the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (Call Re port) and the Thrift Financial Reporting (TFR) instructions. These loans have original amounts of $1 million or less and typically are either secured by nonfarm or nonresidential real estate or are classified as commercial and industrial loan s. However, thrift institutions may also exercise the option to report loans secured by nonfarm residential real estate as "small business loans" if the loans are reported on the TFR as nonmortgage, commercial loans. Small Loan(s) to Farm(s): A loan included in ‘loans to small farms’ as defined in the instructions for preparation of the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (Call Report). These loans have original amounts of $500,000 or less and are either secured by farmland, or are classified as loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers.

66Scope of the Evaluation Evaluation Period/Products Evaluated • The evaluation period for the lending test (excluding community development loans) is January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2000. Home mortgage lending activity does not include 1998 data because many individual loan record s were no longer available for validation. • The evaluation period for community development loan s, the investment test, and the service test is September 22, 1998 through December 31, 2000. • The bank collects home purchase and refinance lo an data even though it is not a HMDA reporter. Bank systems do not separately code home improvement loans. • We did not evaluate home mortgage loans in the le nding test analysis. Re sidential loans are not a primary bank product. Home mortgages loans acc ounted for only 6% of loans over the evaluation period by number (and 9% by dollar volume). • Products reviewed in the lending te st include small business loans, small farm loans, and community development loans. • In the Lending Test, we gave the most weight to farm loans followed by business loans. Farm lending represents 71% of the bank’s loan s by number (and 55% by dollar volume) over the evaluation period. Business lendi ng represents 23% of bank lo ans by number (and 36% by dollar volume). • Market comparisons for business and farm lending are based on 2000 peer data. This was the most recent data available at th e time of the evaluation. • At the bank’s request, we considered qualified investments made by the affiliated Otto Bremer Foundation. • At the bank’s request, we also consid ered automated teller machines (ATMs) owned by the affiliated Bremer Services, Incorporated in the “Service Test” assessment.

77Data Integrity • To assess the accuracy of the bank’s CRA data, we compared reported information to credit file documentation for an independent sample of loans. We did not identify any material errors. • To assess the accuracy of the bank’s HMDA data, we compared reported information to credit file documentation for an independent sample of loan s. We identified a ma terial reporting error involving the inclusion of home equity loans that do not have a HMDA purpose. The bank revised the data during the examination, and we validated its accuracy via another independent sample. The revised data is presented in this evaluation. • We reviewed 100% of the bank’s community devel opment loans, investments, and services. Only those activities that qualified are presen ted and considered in this evaluation. Selection of Areas for Full-Scope Review We performed a full scope review of the bank’s sole assessment area. Ratings The bank’s overall rating is based entirely on performance in its sole assessment area. Other Information Refer to Appendix B for performance context inform ation and a description of the community contacts used in this evaluation. Fair Lending Review We performed an analysis of 1999 and 2000 public comments, consumer complaint information, small business and small farm lending data according to the OCC’s risk based fair lending approach. Based on this analysis, we concl uded that a comprehensive fair le nding examination was not needed in connection with the CRA evaluation this year. The bank’s last comprehensive fair lending examination was performed in 1998.

88Conclusions with Respec t to Performance Tests LENDING TEST Conclusion Bremer’s performance under the Lending Test is ra ted “Outstanding”. Ov erall lending activity is excellent, the borrower distribution of loans is excellent, and the ge ographic distribution of loans is good. The bank also had a high level of community development lending which received positive consideration in our assessment of lending performance. Lending Activity (Refer to Table 1 in Appendix C for the facts and data used to eva luate the bank’s lending activity.) Lending levels reflect excellent re sponsiveness in relation to area cr edit needs and the bank’s deposit market share. Agricultural loans are essential to the vitality of the local economy. Community contacts also identified business loans as an area credit need. Bremer has the most deposits ($326 million)among 39 financial institutions with an office in th e Minot assessment area. The bank’s deposit rank is 1 and its market share is 13%. Farm lending activity is excellent. Bremer re ported 3,864 farm loans totaling $167 million over the evaluation period. Bremer originated 58% of all reported 2000 farm loans in the Minot assessment area, ranking first among 11 lenders. The meaningfulness of market share information is, however, somewhat limited. Only four of 38 local competitors report ed large bank CRA data for the year 2000. These CRA data reporters collectively account for 38% of area deposits. Among CRA data reporters only, Bremer’s farm loan market share is 59% a nd its deposit market share is 33%. Business lending activity is good. Bremer repor ted 1,248 business loans totaling $110 million over the evaluation period. Bremer originat ed 19% of all reported 2000 busine ss loans in the Minot assessment area, ranking first of 36 lenders. As previously me ntioned, the meaningfulness of market share data is somewhat limited. Among CRA data reporters only, Br emer’s business loan market share is 36% and its deposit market share is 33%. In our assessment of lending activity, we also c onsidered the favorable comments received from community contacts and the lack of CRA complaints in the bank’s public CRA file.

99Distribution of Loans by In come Level of the Geography The bank’s overall geographic distribution of loans is good. Small Loans to Farms (Refer to Table 6 in Appendix C for the facts and data us ed to evaluate the ge ographic distribution of the bank’s origination and purchas e of small loans to farms.) The geographic distribution of farm loans is good. Th e bank’s percentage of loans in moderate-income geographies is near the percenta ge of farms located in those ge ographies. There are no low-income geographies in the Minot assessment area. Of all banks that reported 2000 CRA data, Bremer or iginated the most farm loans in moderate-income geographies (and the most farm loans) in the Minot assessment area. The bank’s market share for farm loans in moderate-income areas (51%) is near its ove rall farm loan market share (58%). No other reporting bank had a market share for farm loans in moderate-income geographies of more than 28%. Small Loans to Businesses (Refer to Table 5 in Appendix C for the facts and data us ed to evaluate the ge ographic distribution of the bank’s origination and purchase of small loans to businesses.) The geographic distribution of busine ss loans is excellent. The bank’s pe rcentage of loans in moderate- income geographies significantly exceeds the percenta ge of businesses located in those geographies. Of all banks that reported 2000 CRA data, Bremer originated the most busin ess loans in moderate- income geographies (and the most business loans) in the Minot assessment area. The bank’s market share for business loans in moderate-income areas exceeds its overall business loan market share. No other reporting bank had a market share for busines s loans in moderate-income geographies of more than 10%. Home Mortgage Loans (Refer to Tables 2, 3 and 4 in Appendix C for the facts and data used to evaluate the geographic distribution of the bank’s home mort gage loan originations and purchases.) Residential loans are not a primary bank product and were not analyzed. Lending Gap Analysis Our geographic distribution analys is included a review for any unexplained lending gaps in the Minot AA, particularly in moderate-income geogra phies. We did not identify any conspicuous gaps. Inside/Outside Ratio A substantial majority of the bank’s loans (89% by number) are inside th e Minot assessment area. By product type, 88% of farm loans and 94% of bus iness loans are inside the bank’s assessment area. We viewed this characteristic positivel y in our assessment of lending performance.

--- Page 11 ---
1010Distribution of Loans by In come Level of the Borrower The bank’s overall borrower distri bution of loans is excellent. Small Loans to Farms (Refer to Table 10 in Appendix C fo r the facts and data used to evaluat e the borrower distribution of the bank’s origination and purchase of small loans to farms.) The distribution of loans to farms of difference sizes is excellent. The percentage of loans to small farms (i.e. gross annual revenues of $1 million or le ss) exceeds the percentage of small farms in the assessment area. Of all banks that reported 2000 CRA data, Bremer or iginated the most loans to small farms (and the most farm loans) in the Minot assessment area. In addition, the bank’s market share for loans to small farms exceeds its overall farm loan market share. The bank’s willingness to make loans to small farms is further evidenced by it s loan size distribution. Approximately 90% of Bremer’s reported farm loans were originated in amounts of $100,000 or less. Small Loans to Businesses (Refer to Table 9 in Appendix C fo r the facts and data used to evaluat e the borrower distribution of the bank’s origination and purchase of small loans to businesses.) The distribution of loans to businesses of differen ce sizes is good. The percen tage of loans to small businesses (i.e. gross annual revenues of $1 million or less) substantially meets the percentage of small businesses in the assessment area. Of all banks that reported 2000 CRA data, Bremer orig inated the most loans to small businesses (and the most business loans) in the Minot in assessment area. In addition, th e bank’s market share for loans to small businesses exceeds its overa ll business loan market share. The bank’s willingness to make loans to small bus inesses is further evidenced by its loan size distribution. Approximately 78% of Bremer’s re ported business loans originated in amounts of $100,000 or less. Home Mortgage Loans (Refer to Tables 7, and 8 in Appendix C for the fact s and data used to evaluate the borrower distribution of the bank’s home mortgage l oan originations and purchases.) Residential loans are not a primary bank product and were not analyzed.

--- Page 12 ---
1111Community Development Lending (Refer to Table 1 in Appendix C for the facts and data us ed to evaluate the bank ’s level of community development lending.) Bremer originated three community development loans totaling $6.4 million. Community development loans accounted for 2% of the lend ing activity considered in this evaluation period ( by dollar volume). Community development loans represented 21% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital. The community development loans were responsive to assessme nt area needs in that they promoted economic development and provided social services to low- and moderate-income individuals. This volume of community development lending activity is considered excellent. We did not identify any other banks with this level of community deve lopment lending in the Minot assessment area. The bank’s level of community development lending had a positive impact on its Lending Test assessment.

--- Page 13 ---
1212INVESTMENT TEST (Refer to Table 12 in Appendix C for the facts and data us ed to evaluate the bank ’s level of qualified investments.) Bank performance under the Investment Test is rated “High Satisfactory”. Bremer provided a good level of qualified investme nts in the Minot assessment area. Qualified investments consist primarily of current period cont ributions to organizations that provide community development services. The bank provided 46 qualified grants and donati ons totaling $598 thousand during the evaluation period. Seventy-seven percent of the donations ( by dollar) funded organizati ons that provide social services to low- and moderate-income (LMI) indivi duals. Another 15% of the donations benefited organizations that facilitate sma ll business development. The remain ing 8% benefited organizations that provide affordable housing for LMI individuals. Bremer also has two outstanding prior period invest ments (totaling $200 thousan d) in the North Dakota Small Business Investment Company. The North Dakota Small Business Investment Company is a limited partnership that makes venture capital i nvestments in manufacturing, service, and retail businesses with the potential for s ubstantial growth and long term e quity appreciation. The company serves the entire state of North Dakota. The bank’s volume of qualified investments is cons idered good given the somewhat limited investment opportunities in the assessment area. We did not identify any other opportunities for community development investment securities in our performance context research, community contact work, or our review of the CRA performance evaluations of competing banks. CRA investment opportunities primarily consist of contribu tions to organizations with a community development purpose.

1313SERVICE TEST Bank performance under the Service Te st is rated “High Satisfactory”. Retail Banking Services (Refer to Table 13 in Appendix C for the facts and data us ed to evaluate the di stribution of the bank’s branch delivery system and branch openings and closings.) Bremer’s delivery systems are accessible to geographi es and individuals of different income levels throughout the assessment area. The percentage of branches operated in moderate-income geographies exceeds that of the population. The distribution of ATMs in moderate-income tracts also exceeds the demographic. Twenty percent of the bank’s ATMs accept deposits. Business hours offered throughout the assessment area are reasonable and do no t vary in a way that inconveniences low- or moderate-income geographies or individuals. Bremer offers its complete line of products and services at each offi ce in the assessment area; six locations have in -house lenders. The Devils Lake office (located in a moderate-income ar ea) is one location with an in-house lender. Other branches accept loan applicati on and forward them to the Minot or Devils Lake offices. Alternative delivery systems include a 24-hour telephone service and an Internet banking service. The telephone banking service allows customers to check balances, review account history, transfer funds, initiate stop payment orders, and check CD and loan rates. The Internet banking service offers similar features in addition to accepting loan paym ents and processing bill payment requests. Alternate delivery systems did not influence service test performance, as the bank could not demonstrate the impact of these systems in low- and moderate-income geographies or the use of these systems bylow- and moderate-income individuals. No branches were opened or cl osed during this evaluation period. Community Development Services Bremer provides an adequate level of community development services. During the evaluation period, the bank provided qualifying services to 13 organiza tions. Services primarily consist of providing technical expertise and serving on the Board of Directors for organi zations that address affordable housing needs and small business development.

The bank has one, non-metropolitan assessment area (AA). The AA consists of 12 whole counties (Benson, Bottineau, Dunn, Eddy, Foster , McHenry, McLean, Pierce, Ramsey, Stark, Stutsman, and Ward). The AA resembles an ups ide down “U” covering the north central part of the state. Although the AA is primarily comprised of middle- and upper-income geographies, itdoes contain seven moderate-income areas. The moderate-income geographies are spread throughout the AA. The AA does not contain a ny low-income geographies. The AA complies with regulatory guidelin es and does not arbitrarily exclude LMI areas. The economy is stable and has a mixture of agri culture, manufacturing, and service industries. The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture as many of the bus inesses are directly related to agriculture. Majo r agricultural products include wheat, barley, sunflowers, and beef cattle. Unemployment is well below the national average. We performed a community contact with an economic development organization. We also reviewed five recent contacts by other regulators with tribal government, local government, and economic development representatives. Contacts cited a credit need for business start up and expansion loans. They indicated that area ba nks are very active in the community and are generally meeting area credit needs. Some c ontacts indicated a need for housing stock in some communities, while other communities had ample housing. Community development opportunities in the a ssessment area are somewhat limited. We did not identify any significant opportunities for community development loans, investments or services in our performance context research, commun ity contact work, or our review of the CRA performance evaluations of competing banks. As evidenced by the bank’s performance, community development opportunities primarily cons ist of loans, contributions, and service work with nonprofit organizations that ha ve a community development purpose.

Appendix B-1Numerous commercial banks provide strong comp etition for bank services in the AA. Bremer has the largest deposit market sh are in the AA (13%) as of June 30, 2001. Institutions with the next highest market shares are significantly larger institutions that serve much larger geographic areas - Wells Fargo Bank North Dakota, N.A. (12%) and U.S. Bank N.A. (8%). Other competitors have less than an 8% deposit mark et share each and primarily consist of small, independent community banks.

Appendix C-1Appendix C: Tables of Performance Data Content of Standardized Tables References to the “bank” include activities of a ny affiliates that the bank provided for consideration (refer to appendix A: Scope of the Examination). Fo r purposes of reviewing th e lending test tables, the following are applicable: purchased loans are treated as originations/purchases and market share is the number of loans originated and purchased by the bank as a percentage of the aggregate number of reportable loans originated and purchased by all lenders in the MSA/assessment area. The following is a listing and brie f description of the tables: Table 1. Lending Volume - Presents the number and dollar am ount of reportable loans originated and purchased by the bank over the ev aluation period by MSA/assessment area. Table 2. Geographic Distribution of Home Purchase Loans - Compares the percentage distribution of the number of loans origin ated and purchased by the bank in low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies to the percentage distribution of owner- occupied housing units throughout those geographies. The table also presents market share information based on the most recent aggregate market data available. Table 3. Geographic Distribution of Home Improvement Loans (not applicable) Table 4. Geographic Distribution of Home Mortgage Refinance Loans - See Table 2. Table 5. Geographic Distribut ion of Multifamily Loans - See Table 2. Table 6. Geographic Distribution of Small Loans to Businesses - The percentage distribution of the number of small loans (less than or equa l to $1 million) to businesses originated and purchased by the bank in low-, moderate -, middle-, and upper-income geographies compared to the percentage distribution of businesses (regardl ess of revenue size) throughout those geographies.
