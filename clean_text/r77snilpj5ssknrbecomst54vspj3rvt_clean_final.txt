DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY WASHINGTON, D.C. 20220 INSPECTOR GENERAL for TAX ADMINISTRATION October 14, 1999 MEMORANDUM FOR COMMISSIONER ROSSOTTI FROM: Pamela J. Gardiner Deputy Inspector General for Audit SUBJECT: Final Audit Report - The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, andEnhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program This report presents the results of our review of the 1998 TeleFile Program used by small business taxpayers to file an Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return(Form 941). We evaluated the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS)processes for ensuring that the 1998 Form 941 TeleFile Program was successfullyimplemented. This was the first year for nationwide TeleFile processing of Forms 941. In summary, we found that the IRS established effective processes for ensuring that the 941 TeleFile Program was successfully implemented. The vast majority of Form 941TeleFile returns filed in 1998 were accurately processed and posted to the IRS'Business Masterfile. However, to achieve its long-term goals of increased 941 TeleFileProgram participation, the IRS needs to encourage eligible taxpayers to use the system,educate taxpayers on program changes, and provide quality customer service to allTeleFile users. In addition, improvements to the 941 TeleFile System would prevent thefiling of multiple returns by a taxpayer and would allow the system to verify the filinghistory and electronic signature of TeleFile users. The report recommends that the IRS analyze customer feedback information gathered in 1997 during the 941 TeleFile Program limited expansion to identify ways to increaseparticipation. It also recommends that the IRS educate taxpayers on the requirementsfor using the 941 TeleFile System, as well as any program changes, and ensure qualitycustomer service. In addition, the report recommends enhancements to the system toprevent the processing of duplicate Form 941 TeleFile returns and to verify the filing

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page iExecutive Summary TeleFile is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) voice response system that allows taxpayers to file tax returns using a touch-tone telephone. In 1997, the IRS expanded theTelefile System to allow a limited number of small business taxpayers to file theEmployer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return (Form 941) through the 941 TeleFile System.In 1998, TeleFile was further expanded to allow small businesses nationwide to use thesystem. For the first six months of 1998, almost 460,000 Form 941 returns were filedusing the 941 TeleFile System. TeleFile is an important initiative in the IRS’ overallplans to increase electronic filing of tax returns. The IRS has a goal of 16 million employment tax returns being filed electronically by the year 2002. The TeleFile Program is coordinated through the National Office and includes all of the activities that enable taxpayers to file tax returns using the Telefile System. Theobjective of this audit was to evaluate the effectiveness of the IRS’ processes for ensuring that the 1998 941 TeleFile Program was successfully implemented. Results The 941 TeleFile Program experienced a successful 1998 filing season, its first year of nationwide use (for the period January 1998 through the end of our fieldwork inNovember 1998). The IRS had effectively corrected prior audit findings, and ensuredthat Form 941 tax returns were accurately processed through the Telefile System andrecorded on the taxpayers’ accounts in the IRS’ computer systems. However, to achieve the long-term goals of the 941 TeleFile Program, the IRS needs to: • Encourage eligible taxpayers to use the 941 TeleFile Program. • Provide quality customer service to TeleFile users. • Improve 941 TeleFile computer controls to prevent taxpayers from filing multiple returns and allow the system to verify a TeleFile user’s filing history and electronic signature. The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Eligible Taxpayers to Use the 941 TeleFile Program The customer feedback information gathered during the 1997 limited expansion should be used to increase 941 TeleFile Program participation . The IRS obtained information from taxpayers who chose not to use the 941 TeleFile System. Thiscustomer feedback showed that many taxpayers had not used the 941 TeleFile Systemeither because they used a paid preparer or because they wanted a paper copy of the

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page iireturn. This information could have been used to focus the IRS’ marketing efforts to address any taxpayer misconceptions about the system. During 1998, there was nosignificant increase in the percentage of eligible taxpayers who used the TeleFileProgram. The IRS needs to focus its marketing efforts to encourage more taxpayers touse the 941 TeleFile System. This will enable the IRS to achieve its goal of 16 million electronically filed employment tax returns by the year 2002. The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Provide Quality Customer Service to TeleFile Users A more effective method for resolving taxpayer problems needs to be established . The IRS has not implemented a process for delivering effective one-stop customerservice to taxpayers using the 941 TeleFile Program (correctly handling their questions orconcerns during their first contact with the IRS). Taxpayers with questions regardingForm 941 TeleFile returns are instructed to contact a customer service call site. The callsite representative will then either contact the TeleFile Coordinator to ask the question for the taxpayer or will instruct the taxpayer to contact the Coordinator directly. Taxpayers should be informed when they are no longer eligible to participate in the 941 TeleFile Program . If a taxpayer’s annual Form 941 liability exceeds a certain dollar criteria, then the taxpayer is no longer eligible to use the 941 TeleFile System. The IRShas no procedures to notify taxpayers of this and to suggest other electronic methods for filing the Form 941 returns. The 941 TeleFile forms and instructions should be timely updated to reflect program changes . The 941 TeleFile tax package (which includes the forms and instructions mailed to taxpayers) was not timely updated to indicate that the IRS wouldaccept returns with a higher balance due amount than had been accepted previously.Some taxpayers may not have used the 941 TeleFile System because of the incorrect instructions. The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Improve 941 TeleFile Computer Controls to Prevent Taxpayers From Filing Multiple Returns and Allow the System to Verify a TeleFile User’s Filing History and Electronic Signature The 941 TeleFile System should prevent multiple returns from being filed by a taxpayer . Normally, TeleFile returns are received at one processing site, with a backup site available to handle the excess volume. If both sites are receiving returns, and ataxpayer files a second (amended) return on the same day the first (original) return wasfiled, both returns could be accepted by TeleFile if the returns were processed at separatesites. The IRS would not be aware of the potential duplicate or amended return becausedata from the two sites are only merged and updated at the end of the day. When thisoccurs, TeleFile always processes the return received at the main processing site, and not

--- Page 6 ---
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page iiithe return from the backup site, even though the taxpayer may have intended otherwise. While this should not be a common occurrence, we performed some limited testing andidentified several instances where a taxpayer filed more than one return on the same day.This is a systemic problem that will be compounded as the population of TeleFile users increases. The look-back period could be used to ensure businesses are authenticated (i.e., verified) to use the 941 TeleFile System . The IRS requires taxpayers to be in business for at least 12 months before using the 941 TeleFile System. However, theexisting 941 TeleFile System will accept and process returns from taxpayers, even thoughthey are not authenticated to use the 941 TeleFile System. The IRS has a current processin place (the look-back period) that could be used to provide the IRS with more assurance that taxpayers have an established filing history when using the 941 TeleFile System. The process for verifying the electronic signature of 941 TeleFile System users needs to be improved . There is not an effective process to ensure that returns filed using the 941 TeleFile System were actually filed by the taxpayers or their representatives. Theprocess for verifying the electronic signatures of the taxpayers is incomplete because(1) only a sample of the electronic signatures are verified as correct, and (2) there are no procedures for following up on invalid signatures. Summary of Recommendations The IRS should analyze the customer feedback information gathered during the 1997 limited expansion to determine how 941 TeleFile Program participation can beincreased. In addition, the IRS needs to ensure 941 TeleFile Program taxpayers are givenquality customer service when resolving taxpayer problems with the 941 TeleFileProgram. Also, the 941 TeleFile computer controls need to be enhanced to preventduplicate Form 941 returns from being filed and to improve the process for verifying the filing history and electronic signature of taxpayers using the 941 TeleFile System. Management’s Response: IRS management agreed with the conditions cited in the report and has designed and, in some instances, implemented actions to correct the problems. To improve its marketing effort to increase participation in the 941 TeleFile Program, theIRS has contracted with a vendor to develop a comprehensive marketing andcommunication strategy that will focus on the Form 941 products. In addition, the IRShas made several enhancements and clarifications to the 1998 TeleFile tax package to address customer feedback received in 1997 and 1998. To ensure 941 TeleFile Program taxpayers are given quality customer service, the IRS will update the instructions for its telephone representatives to include additional programdetail, processing guidelines, and questions and answers. In addition, the IRS tested an

To prevent duplicate returns from being filed, the IRS has implemented a process to eliminate duplicate returns when multiple sites are used to process returns. To improvethe process for verifying the identity of taxpayers using TeleFile, the IRS will redesign the return filing confirmation number to make it unique for each taxpayer. Management’s complete response to the draft report is included as Appendix VI. (Note: the report recommendations were renumbered after management issued their response,and, therefore, do not correspond directly with the recommendation numbers shown in Appendix VI.)

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page 1Objective and Scope The TeleFile Program for the Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return (Form 941) was designed to providebusinesses with flexible and convenient ways to filereturns. The overall objective of the audit was to evaluatethe effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS)processes for ensuring that the 1998 941 TeleFile Program was successfully implemented. Specifically, we: • Evaluated actions taken in response to a prior audit report titled, “Evaluation of the 1997 TeleFile Pilot - Business Masterfile” (Reference Number 080704, Dated December 2, 1997) on the 1997 TeleFile limited expansion for Form 941 tax returns. • Evaluated the effectiveness of the IRS’ processes for ensuring Form 941 TeleFile returns were accurately processed nationwide. • Evaluated the effectiveness of the IRS’ publicity efforts to increase the number of businesses that file returns using the 941 TeleFile System. The review was conducted between July 1998 and November 1998 at the National Office and theCincinnati Service Center (CSC), with limited testing atthe Tennessee (TCC) and Martinsburg ComputingCenters (MCC). These centers are the IRS officeswhere TeleFile returns are filed and processed. Weperformed this review in accordance with Government Auditing Standards . Appendix I provides the detailed objective, scope, and methodology used to conduct the audit; Appendix II liststhe major contributors to this report; and Appendix III reflects the Report Distribution List. During the review, we issued two audit memoranda communicating several issues requiring immediateattention. This report presents a summary of thetwo memoranda and additional audit results completedThe overall objective was to evaluate the effectiveness ofthe IRS’ processes for ensuring that the 1998 941 TeleFile Program wassuccessfully implemented.

IRS management responded to the first memorandum. A copy of the firstmemorandum and management’s response are included in Appendices IV and V, respectively. Background TeleFile is a voice response system that allows taxpayers to file tax returns using a touch-tonetelephone. The Telefile System uses Electronic Filing(ELF) to process returns. The Program is coordinatedthrough the Electronic Tax Administration (ETA) Officeat the National Office and includes all of the activitiesthat enable taxpayers to file tax returns using the TelefileSystem. Beginning in 1996, the TeleFile Programenabled individual taxpayers across the nation to filereturns over the telephone. The IRS expanded theProgram in 1997 by allowing a limited number of smallbusiness taxpayers to file Form 941 returns through the 941 TeleFile System. On December 2, 1997, the IRS Inspection Service (now Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration)issued a report titled, “Evaluation of the 1997 TeleFile Pilot - Business Masterfile.” The purpose of that audit was to evaluate controls over the 941 TeleFile Programand determine whether it was properly implemented.We concluded that the IRS experienced a successfullimited expansion with 48,834 Form 941 returns filedand 99 percent of the businesses able to access thesystem on their first attempt. However, the following issues were also identified: • The 941 TeleFile Program allowed new businesses and businesses that were not current with their filing requirements to participate in the Program. • Taxpayers in the 941 TeleFile Program were not always properly verified. • Instructions in the Form 941 TeleFile package contained an error that could be confusing to taxpayers.

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page 3ETA management generally agreed with our recommendations and established plans for correctiveaction. In 1998, TeleFile was further expanded to allowsmall business taxpayers nationwide to file Form 941 returns electronically. Results Overall, the IRS has established effective processes for ensuring that the 941 TeleFile Program was successfullyimplemented. For example, Form 941 TeleFile returnsfiled in 1998 were accurately processed and posted tothe taxpayers’ accounts. In addition, the IRSimplemented corrective actions from the 1997 audit,which increased assurances that only authorized taxpayers participated in the Program. Nearly 460,000 employment tax returns were filed for the first six months of calendar year 1998 using the941 TeleFile System. In addition, approximately94 percent of the business taxpayers that attempted tofile over the telephone in the second quarter of calendaryear 1998 were successful. The remaining six percentof the taxpayers were either not allowed by the IRS tocomplete their TeleFile return because they did not meetthe eligibility requirements or they hung-up before completing their return. Although the IRS had a successful 1998 filing season (January 1998 through December 1998) for the941 TeleFile Program, additional actions are needed tomarket the 941 TeleFile Program to eligible users and toimprove customer service for TeleFile users.Improvements in these two areas should enhance theIRS’ ability to achieve its goal of 16 millionemployment tax returns being filed electronically by the year 2002. The IRS needs to improve its marketing and customer service by: • Using the customer feedback information gathered during the 1997 limited expansion to increase TeleFile Program participation.ETA management agreed with the results from the prior report and established plansfor corrective action. Nationwide implementation of the 941 TeleFile Program wassuccessful. Additional actions are needed to ensure the IRS achieves its goal of 16 million employment tax returns being filed electronically by theyear 2002.

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program • Establishing a more effective method for resolving taxpayer problems with the 941 TeleFile Program. • Informing taxpayers when they are no longer eligible to participate in the 941 TeleFile Program. • Ensuring that 941 TeleFile Program forms and instructions are timely updated to reflect program changes. Our review also showed that improvements to the TeleFile computer controls would help ensure that the correct return is processed by: • Preventing the filing of multiple returns by a taxpayer. • Using the look-back period to ensure businesses using the 941 TeleFile System are authenticated (i.e., verified) to use the system. • Improving the process of verifying the electronic signatures of 941 TeleFile System users. The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Eligible Taxpayers to Use the 941 TeleFile Program The IRS should use the customer feedback information gathered during the 1997 limited expansion to increase 941 TeleFile Program participation . We found no evidence that the IRS focused its marketing on the 941 TeleFile Programnon-users (those 941 filers who were eligible to useTeleFile but did not do so) to increase the number of businesses participating in the Program. The IRS obtained customer feedback information during the 1997 Customer Satisfaction Survey, which includedthe reasons why taxpayers used or did not use theTelefile System. Customer feedback obtained fromeligible non-users of the 941 TeleFile Program indicated that:Improvements to the computer controls would prevent a taxpayer from filing more than one return per day. The IRS has not used customer feedback from 1997 to identify ways to better market theProgram to eligible users.

--- Page 12 ---
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program • Approximately 39 percent of eligible non-users employed a paid tax preparer (called a third- party preparer) to complete and file their quarterly returns. • Another 23 percent of the businesses did not use the Program because they wanted a copy of the return. The IRS does not know why the third-party preparers did not file clients' returns electronically. The TeleFileteam that measures quality recommended that the IRSmarket and educate third-party preparers to increasefuture use of the 941 TeleFile Program. However, theETA office did not use the information gathered orprepare a 941 TeleFile Program marketing strategy forcalendar year 1998 and there were no coordinatednationwide efforts toward third-party preparers. During1998, IRS employees again traveled around the country to obtain customer feedback from businesses. The feedback contained some of the same issues as theprevious year, further emphasizing the need for the IRSto analyze and use this information to address any taxpayer misconceptions about the System. The National Office also did not provide any of the marketing information to the district TeleFilecoordinators after nationwide implementation of the941 TeleFile Program. These employees wereresponsible for marketing the 941 TeleFile Program andindicated that they received no marketing informationspecifically on the 941 TeleFile Program from theNational Office. In addition, we were informed that theoverall ETA marketing strategy efforts in 1998 focusedprimarily on the IRS’ TeleFile Program for individualtaxpayers (known as “Individual Masterfile (IMF) TeleFile”), and not on the 941 TeleFile Program. The IRS sent TeleFile tax packages to eligible taxpayers in 1998; however, the lack of emphasis on marketing the941 TeleFile Program in 1998 may be reflected in thelow volume of participation in the Program. Wedetermined that the percentage of eligible filers usingthe Telefile System in 1998 was almost the same asNo marketing strategy was developed for the 941 TeleFileProgram.

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program (6.7 percent of the eligible filers in 1998 compared to 6.2 percent in 1997). Through the second quarter ofcalendar year 1998, approximately 460,000 employmenttax returns were filed by businesses using the 941TeleFile System. Unless there is a significant increasein the number of 941 TeleFile returns filed for thesecond half of calendar year 1998, the IRS will be about24 percent below its estimate of 1.2 million 941 TeleFile returns filed for 1998. The IRS has taken steps to improve its marketing efforts by contracting with an outside vendor to develop astrategy for marketing the 941 TeleFile Program. Thecontract will go into effect the first quarter of calendaryear 1999. With the emphasis on customer service andon increasing the number of electronic returns, the IRSneeds to consider any information that could be used tohelp achieve its goal of 16 million employment taxreturns being filed electronically by the year 2002. Recommendations The IRS needs to improve its marketing towards eligible businesses to increase participation in the 941 TeleFile Program. Specific actions include: • Using the non-users’ customer feedback responses to determine where to concentrate marketing efforts (i.e., third party preparers). • Clarifying the 941 TeleFile Program instructions and educational material to address taxpayers’ misconceptions with the system (e.g., informingtaxpayers that they will receive a confirmation number as proof of filing). Management’s Response: The IRS has evaluated the non-user responses and determined that since the IRS identifies eligible users prior to filing, and sends taxpackages to those taxpayers, it will continue toemphasize a direct marketing approach by using the taxpackages to communicate messages directly to eligible users. ETA management has written tax package instructions to be easy to read and understand. They have alsoThe IRS has evaluated the non-user responses from the1997 limited expansion and will continue to use tax packages as its primary method for communicating directly with eligible users.

--- Page 14 ---
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page 7addressed many misconceptions of users, eligible non- users, and tax preparers. For example, the instructionregarding proof of filing or return acceptance has beenrevised to draw more emphasis to this benefit and to theissuance of a confirmation number by the Telefile System. ETA management has also established a group to promote awareness and education to internal andexternal audiences. In addition, the IRS periodicallyprovides articles and Questions and Answers on the 941 TeleFile Program to employees and taxpayers toimprove publicity, education, and instructions for IRS electronic filing programs. The IRS has contracted with a vendor to develop a comprehensive marketing and communications strategythat will focus on the “941 Suite” of products. The finalplan “IRS Marketing for Business Masterfile (BMF)Initiatives” was delivered December 23, 1998. The plangave further direction and provided recommendationsfor the best marketing approach for electronic business options. The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Provide Quality Customer Service to TeleFile Users The IRS needs to establish a more effective method for resolving taxpayer problems with the 941 TeleFile Program . The IRS has not established an effective method for delivering quality customer serviceto taxpayers using the 941 TeleFile Program. Currently,business taxpayers with questions about their 941TeleFile return contact IRS Customer Service. Thecustomer service representative then either contacts theTeleFile Coordinator or has the taxpayer contact theCoordinator. We were advised that the TeleFileCoordinator currently handles about 20 phone calls per day. Since this was the first full year of nationwide use, most of these calls could be handled by the TeleFileAn effective method for resolving taxpayer problems isneeded.

--- Page 15 ---
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page 8Coordinator. However, the current process does not meet the IRS’ goal of resolving taxpayers’ problemsduring their initial contact with the IRS. In addition, asthe number of TeleFile users increases, a more effectivemethod will need to be implemented since TeleFile is not adequately staffed to handle taxpayer problems. The IRS is testing an Employment Tax call site for 90 days at the MCC and an employment tax web page onthe Internet. These two options, if implemented, couldimprove the customer service provided to businesses using the 941 TeleFile Program. Taxpayers should be informed when they are no longer eligible to participate in the 941 TeleFile Program . The 941 TeleFile Program will not allow businesses with tax liabilities greater than $50,000 touse the system because those businesses are required tofile an additional supporting schedule with the Form 941 return. The IRS uses a taxpayer’s prior filing history to determine the taxpayer’s requirements for depositingemployment tax payments (known as Federal TaxDeposits or FTDs) towards their yearly tax liability.Specifically, the IRS uses the taxpayer’s Form 941 filinghistory for 12 months (e.g., beginning July 1 st and ending June 30th of the prior year). This period is called the look-back period. Once the taxpayer’s total taxliability exceeds $50,000, they are required to deposittheir FTDs on a semi-weekly basis and are also requiredto file an Employer’s Record of Federal Tax Liability (Schedule B), with the Form 941 return. When business taxpayers exceed the $50,000 liability threshold, the IRS issues an Annual Notification of FTDDeposit Requirements (CP-136 notice), advising themthat their FTD requirements have changed from monthlyto semi-weekly. However, the notice does not mentionthat the taxpayer is no longer eligible to use the941 TeleFile Program because they exceeded thethreshold. It also does not indicate that they are now required to file a Schedule B with the Form 941 return.Some current 941 TeleFile Program users will not be allowed to use TeleFile for 1999 because their tax liabilities have exceeded the dollar threshold, but the IRSdoes not inform them of this.

--- Page 16 ---
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page 9Once a taxpayer is required to file a Schedule B, they cannot file electronically through the Telefile System.During the first six months of 1998, there were 236,344filers who attempted to use TeleFile and 8,294 of thesefilers were not allowed to use the System because theywere required to file a Schedule B with the Form 941return. These Schedule B filers (3.5 percent of thepopulation) received a CP-136 notice and may havesubsequently called the IRS to determine why they wereno longer eligible to use TeleFile. These types of callscould be prevented if the IRS notifies the taxpayer whenthey are no longer eligible to use the 941 TeleFileSystem. The IRS could use the CP-136 to advisetaxpayers that they are no longer eligible to use TeleFileand that they are now required to file a Schedule B with the Form 941 return. The notice could also advise the taxpayer of other alternatives for filing their returns, such as ELF. The IRS needs to ensure that the 941 TeleFile Program forms and instructions are timely updated to reflect program changes . On October 2, 1998, we issued a memorandum advising the IRS that theinstructions to the 941 TeleFile package had not beenupdated to reflect a revision to the criteria scheduled foruse with the Telefile System in the fourth quarter ofcalendar year 1998. This criteria change involvedpermitting taxpayers with a balance due tax liability of$1,000 or less to use the 941 TeleFile System. Prior tothis criteria change, taxpayers could only use the 941TeleFile System if they had a balance due of $500 orless. Our review of the fourth quarter TeleFile tax package instructions and the 941 TeleFile tax form showed thatthey had not been revised to reflect that the balance duecriteria of $500 was raised to $1,000. Line 15 of the941 TeleFile tax form incorrectly instructed thetaxpayers that if they owed a balance due of $500 ormore, then they could not use the 941 TeleFile System.This information was also included on Page TEL-1 ofthe tax package instructions. TeleFile packages had not been updated to reflect therevised balance due limitationof $1,000.

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page 10The IRS was expected to mail approximately 3.5 million fourth quarter TeleFile packages to taxpayers inDecember 1998. The omission to the instructions mayhave caused some eligible taxpayers to not use the941 TeleFile System. The incorrect instructions mayimpact IRS management’s ability to achieve their goalof 16 million employment tax returns being filed electronically by the year 2002. The IRS is currently in the process of enhancing the 941 TeleFile Program to accept all balance due returnseffective January 4, 1999. This change will eliminate the balance due dollar restriction. Recommendations The IRS should ensure that Customer Service representatives located at Customer Service sites are adequately trained to handle 941 TeleFile Program problems. The IRS should provide additional wording to the CP-136 notice to advise taxpayers they are no longereligible to use the 941 TeleFile Program and toadvise them of other electronic alternatives for filing their returns, such as ELF. In a memorandum dated October 2, 1998, we recommended that the fourth and subsequent quarterTeleFile tax packages be revised to correctly instruct taxpayers on the revised criteria. Management’s Response: The IRS will supplement Part 21 of the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) for customer service representatives to include additionalprogram detail and processing instructions when responding to calls from taxpayers. The test for the new Employment Tax call site was conducted between October and December 1998. Basedon the results of the test, the IRS has proposed the establishment of the call site. IRS management has requested a computer code for the 941 TeleFile Program to enable them to track and retaineligible filers. Based on Information Systems resources,The IRS is supplementing Part 21 of the IRM to includeadditional detail and instructions when responding to calls from taxpayers, and has proposed the establishment of an Employment Tax call site.

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page 11the assignment of this code may not be possible until the year 2001. The IRS will explore the recommendation to include information in the CP-136 notice that will advise thetaxpayer that if they are required to file a Schedule B,they are no longer eligible to use the 941 TeleFileSystem. The IRS is also working on incorporating the Schedule B into the 941 TeleFile System, which is the basis for the expansion of the 941 TeleFile Program. The IRS explained that it could not revise the 941 TeleFile tax package prior to mailing the fourth quarterpackages. The TeleFile instructions and tax packagewere subsequently updated and the changes wereeffective in the mailout for the first quarter of calendar year 1999. The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Improve 941 TeleFile Computer Controls to Prevent Taxpayers From Filing Multiple Returns andAllow the System to Verify a TeleFile User's Filing History and Electronic Signature The 941 TeleFile computer system should prevent the filing of multiple returns by a taxpayer . Form 941 TeleFile returns are primarily processed at the TCC. Ifthe TCC cannot handle the volume of returns beingfiled, or if the Telefile System is not working at TCC,the CSC serves as the backup site to handle the excessvolume. The CSC currently accepts TeleFile returnsonly during peak filing periods, which are the last twodays of the filing month. Returns from the two locationsare merged and updated on the 941 TeleFile System atthe end of each day. In contrast, the IRS’ IMF TeleFilecomputer system, which processes Individual Income Tax Returns (Form 1040), is updated every 15 minutes. Occasionally, taxpayers file a second, or amended, return to correct errors or omissions in their original taxreturn. The TeleFile tax package instructions state thatamended returns cannot be filed through TeleFile andThe IRS is exploring the recommendation to include information about a change in a taxpayer’s eligibility for the941 TeleFile Program in theCP-136 notice. Multiple Form 941 TeleFile returns are being filed.

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page 12must be filed on paper. However, if a taxpayer attempts to file more than one Form 941 TeleFile return in thesame peak filing day, both returns could be processedseparately at the two sites. Since the Systems are onlymerged and updated at the end of the day, TeleFilewould not be aware of the potential duplicate oramended return and would accept both returns.However, when there are duplicate returns, TeleFilealways processes the return received at the primaryprocessing site (TCC). The return filed at the CSC, thebackup site, would not be processed even though the taxpayer may have intended otherwise. Our audit showed that the 941 TeleFile System did not prevent multiple returns from being filed when both theTCC and the CSC were receiving TeleFile returns. Wetested the peak processing period for the second quarterof calendar year 1998 and identified 17 businesstaxpayers that filed more than one 941 return on the Telefile System. This process may cause the taxpayer to contact the IRS to ensure the correct return was processed, whichincreases taxpayer burden. This problem will becompounded as the volume of both Form 1040 andForm 941 TeleFile returns increases and there are moredays when both the TCC and the CSC are accepting TeleFile returns. The IRS could use the look-back period to ensure businesses using the 941 TeleFile System are authenticated (i.e., verified) to use the System . Under existing processes, business taxpayers can participate inthe 941 TeleFile Program without being authenticated.Each quarter, the IRS creates a database of taxpayerswho are eligible to use the 941 TeleFile System. Eachof the taxpayers in the database has been in business forat least the last 12 months. Requiring taxpayers to be inbusiness for at least a year assures the IRS that the 941TeleFile System is only used by businesses with anestablished filing history. Using the look-back period,which relies on the Form 941 filing history over the pastyear, will provide the IRS with more assurance that Businesses are filing returns through the 941 TeleFile System without beingauthenticated (i.e., verified) touse the system.

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page 13taxpayers have an established filing history when using the 941 TeleFile System. To verify the taxpayer’s identity, the IRS requires the taxpayer to enter the prior year’s third quarter total FTDamount each time a Form 941 return is filed. If thetaxpayer did not file a prior year third quarter Form 941return or have any FTDs for that quarter and enters azero in the FTD amount field, the computer allows thetaxpayer to file the current Form 941 return. As a result,businesses are able to participate in the Program eventhough they have not established a filing history todetermine their filing requirements. However, it is possible due to timing for an eligible taxpayer (in business for at least 12 months) to not havea prior year third quarter FTD amount. For example,taxpayers eligible to file for the fourth quarter of 1998(October 1998 - December 1998) would only have to bein business since the fourth quarter of calendar year1997 (October 1997 – December 1997). Thesetaxpayers would not have a prior year third quarter FTDamount because they were not in business during the third quarter of calendar year 1997. The IRS should improve the process of verifying the electronic signatures of the 941 TeleFile System users . Currently, taxpayers electronically sign their returns by entering their Social Security Number (SSN)and their last name. After TeleFile accepts the return,the System provides a confirmation number to thetaxpayer. The confirmation number is based, in part, on the date the return is filed. Because the taxpayer’s electronic signature (name and SSN) cannot be verified on-line against the IRS’computer system, a sample of electronic signatures ismanually reviewed at the end of the quarter as a qualitymeasure. The TeleFile Coordinator selects a randomsample of returns and manually matches the names andSSNs to the IRS’ Masterfile to ensure the returns were filed by the taxpayer or his or her representative. The TeleFile Coordinator’s review at the end of the first quarter of calendar year 1998 showed that about Five percent of the electronic signatures were not valid.

--- Page 21 ---
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program percent of the electronic signatures were valid. Five percent of the signatures were not valid because the SSNdid not match the name control. However, the IRS doesnot have procedures to follow up on the invalid signatures, allowing potential invalid returns to be filed. This raises the question about the purpose of this quality review. If it is important to verify the signature bymanually reviewing a sample of returns, then the IRS should follow up on the invalid signatures. Recommendations The IRS should update the 941 TeleFile System using the same update process used by the IMFTelefile System. This process would result inupdates every 15 minutes, which reduces the risk of multiple returns being filed. The IRS should require taxpayers to be in business for the entire look-back period to be eligible to participate in the 941 TeleFile Program. The IRS should assess the risks associated with the electronic signature process and develop appropriateactions based on this assessment. If the IRS elects tocontinue the existing process, we recommend thatthe IRS determine an acceptable error rate forinvalid signatures and take appropriate action when the error rate is exceeded. Management’s Response: To prevent duplicate returns from being filed, the IRS has implemented a Data Replication process to eliminate duplicate returns whenmultiple sites are used to process returns . This process will be tracked to ensure it is successful. ETA management will analyze the computer program criteria for determining if a taxpayer is eligible to usethe 941 TeleFile System to ensure it is capturing eligiblefilers for the full look-back period. ETA management isalso researching the possibility of allowing all newbusinesses that otherwise meet the 941 TeleFile Program requirements to use the System.

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page 15The IRS is researching a random sample of SSNs for invalid electronic signatures. The IRS is sending lettersto the taxpayers who provided the invalid signatures,and informing them their tax return may be delayed untilthe letter is returned with a valid signature. The IRS isalso working on redesigning the return filingconfirmation number so that it will be unique to eachtaxpayer, which will allow the IRS to continue to trackthe electronic signature information on a quarterly basis.The results of the electronic signature information andan assessment of the error rate will continue to be reported. Conclusion Overall, the IRS experienced a successful 1998 filing season for the 941 TeleFile Program. Returns wereaccurately processed and approximately 94 percent ofthe business taxpayers attempting to file electronicallythrough the 941 TeleFile System were successful.Improving the marketing and customer service processeswill increase assurances that more of the eligible filerswill use the 941 TeleFile Program in the future. Inaddition, improvements to the 941 TeleFile System willprevent taxpayers from filing multiple returns and willimprove the process for verifying the filing history andelectronic signatures of taxpayers using the 941 TeleFile System.The IRS is redesigning the return filing confirmation number to make it unique foreach taxpayer. Ninety-four percent of the businesses that attempted touse the 941 TeleFile System in the second quarter of calendar year 1998 were successful.

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program Page 16Appendix I Detailed Objective, Scope, and Methodology The overall objective of this audit was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) processes for ensuring that the 1998 941 TeleFile Program was successfully implemented. To accomplish the overall objective, we conducted the following tests: I. Evaluated whether the IRS took appropriate actions to address the following issues identified in the prior review. A. Determined whether taxpayers were adequately identified by selecting a sample of 50 Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return (Form 941)TeleFile returns to determine whether the taxpayer had to enter the correctamount in the security field (total third quarter Federal Tax Deposit amount from the prior year) before being allowed to file. B. Determined whether only eligible taxpayers filed 941 TeleFile returns. II. Matched the Martinsburg Computing Center requirements for extracting 1998 eligible 941 TeleFile businesses to the 1998 TeleFile package. III. Reviewed 941 TeleFile returns filed for the second quarter of calendar year 1998 to determine whether only eligible businesses filed. IV. Determined the effectiveness of the IRS’ processes for ensuring 941 TeleFile returns were accurately processed and accounted for during the nationwide implementation. A. Reviewed a sample of 114 Form 941 TeleFile returns filed for the second quarter of calendar year 1998 and determined whether taxpayer return information posted correctly to the Masterfile. B. Tracked the second quarter 941 TeleFile returns from the Tennessee Computing Center and Cincinnati Service Center Telefile Systems to the Masterfile. C. Evaluated the IRS’ efforts to verify the electronic signatures (Social Security Numbers and last name) used to sign the 941 TeleFile returns. V. Assessed publicity efforts for increasing the number of businesses who filed 1998 returns using the 941 TeleFile Program. A. Evaluated the IRS’ efforts to market the 1998 941 TeleFile Program by reviewing marketing materials and interviewing project office employees.

Although Internal Revenue Manual 1289 provides 30 workdays forresponding to an Internal Audit memorandum, we are requesting that you advise us of theaction you plan take in a written response within 10 workdays. This request is beingmade as a result of the time sensitivity of the issue. If you have any suggestions forimproving or clarifying this memorandum, please contact me or Audit Manager Jim Westcott at (606) 292-5162. Instructions to the BMF TeleFile package have not been updated to reflect program enhancements scheduled for the Telefile System in the fourth quarter. We determined that the 941 TeleFile Tax packages have not been revised to show that the $500 balance due limit is no longer in effect. The Service is in the process of enhancingthe BMF TeleFile program to accept all balance due returns effective January 4, 1999.This change will eliminate the restriction for taxpayers who owe a balance due of $500 ormore. Previously, if a taxpayer attempted to file and had a balance due of $500 or morethey would receive a message indicating that their balance due exceeded the balance dueamount that TeleFile can accept and that the Service cannot continue with the processingof their return. Furthermore, taxpayers would be advised to file a paper return for thequarter. Our review showed that the TeleFile package instructions and the 941 TeleFile Tax Record have not been revised to eliminate the balance due criteria of $500 or more. Line15 of the 941 TeleFile Tax Record incorrectly tells the taxpayer that if they owe a balancedue of $500 or more, they cannot use 941 TeleFile. This information is also included onPage TEL-1 of the tax package instructions. Modifications to the 941 TeleFile Programfor the fourth quarter eliminated the restriction of taxpayers who owe a balance due of

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program $500 or more. The BMF TeleFile packages are scheduled to be mailed in December 1998, for the fourth quarter. This oversight to the instructions will cause taxpayers not to use the BMF TeleFile program. We estimate the Service plans to mail approximately 3.4 million 941TeleFilepackages for the fourth quarter. With the emphasis on customer service and on increasingthe number of taxpayers filing returns electronically, the Service cannot afford tooverlook issues that may impact these goals. Recommendation To minimize losing potential taxpayers that are eligible to file 941 TeleFile, we recommend that the fourth and subsequent quarter TeleFile tax packages, including the941 TeleFile Tax Record line 15, be revised by removing the reference to the $500balance due. cc: Assistant Commissioner (Electronic Tax Administration) OP:ETA National Director, Electronic Program Operations OP:ETA:OAssistant Commissioner (Forms and Submission Processing) OP:FS
