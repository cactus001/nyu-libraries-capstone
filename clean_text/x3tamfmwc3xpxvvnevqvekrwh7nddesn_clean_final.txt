May 20, 2013 The Honorable Bernard Sanders Chairman, Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions 648 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Dear Chairman Sanders: On behalf of the National Council on Aging, I am pleased to share NCOA's endorsement of the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2013 and commend you for this important first step to spur a bipartisan, bicameral reauthorization process for the 113th Congress. We appreciate your continued leadership to advance a very thoughtful reauthorization package that continues to recognize that the Act still provides a strong foundation for the Aging Services Network and its partners to empower older adults to retain or improve their health and economic independence so they can remain in their own homes and communities. The most significant reason why the Act has not yet fully realized its true potential has been a lack of investment, which your bill addresses through several Sense of the Senate statements. Reauthorization of the OAA as increasing waves of Baby Boomers turn 65 is crucial to ensure that successes of the Act can be better leveraged, and innovation continues to be fostered to meet the needs of today's seniors. Proposals in your legislation that seize this opportunity include those which define economic security and significantly establish it as a goal of the Act, emphasize the delivery of evidence-based chronic disease self-management and falls prevention, promote senior center modernization, enhance the Senior Community Services Employment Program (SCSEP), and strengthen legal assistance and other elder justice provisions. Together, these improvements can empower seniors and improve their health and economic security, bend downward the long-term entitlements cost curve, and promote greater program efficiency and coordination. We applaud your ongoing efforts to move OAA reauthorization forward, and we look forward to continuing to work with you to promote a bipartisan process that remains true to the history of this important legislation. Sincerely, James P. Firman, Ed.D. President & CEO

May 20, 2013 The Honorable Bernard Sanders United States Senate 332 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Senator Sanders, The Strengthen Social Security Coalition is comprised of over 350 national and statewide organizations, including labor, womens, aging, disability, veterans and civil rights groups, whose goal is to strengthen Social Security benefits for current and future beneficiaries. We are writing to express our unwavering support for the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act. This vital piece of legislation has created outlets of support for seniors to live in their communities with independence and dignity since 1965 when it was signed into law . The Older Americans Act reauthorization directs the Bureau of Labor Statistics to create a more robust version of the Consumer Price Index for the elderly (CPI-E) which is a more accurate measure of costs for seniors. As compared to the rest of the population, the average senior disproportionately spends a substantially larger portion of their income on health care, heating, cooling and other housing costs. Adjusting the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) to reflect inflation based on the CPI-E would afford a more accurate Social Security benefit for thousands of seniors across America who currently only receive a modest income. This reauthorization would strengthen the Older Americans Act by reauthorizing all programs through FY 2018 and requesting a 12 percent increase in appropriations from FY 2010 in order to address the needs of the baby boom generation. Updating the definitions of social and economic need to include outreach to LGBT individuals, veterans, and those with Alzheimer’s disease is essential to providing quality assistance to a diverse and growing senior population . The reauthorization also introduces efforts to protect seniors from abuse and authorizes new grants to strengthen the environment of senior and caregiver supports around the country- including the creation of the National Resource Center on Family Caregiving . The reauthorization of the Older Americans Act is critical to ensuring the wellbeing of seniors in the United States who are committed to living out their days in the comfort of their own communities. Your efforts to stand up as a v oice for the aging population are celebrated among our coalition, and we thank you for your strong leadership. Sincerely, Nancy Altman Eric Kingson Coalition Co ‐Chair Coalition Co ‐Chair

National Association of State Long -Term Care Ombudsman Programs Joseph Rodrigues, NASOP President Office of the State Long- Term Care Ombudsman 1300 National Drive, Suite 200 Sacramento, CA 95834 Phone (916) 419- 7510 FAX (916) 928- 2503 E-mail: jrodrigu@aging.ca.gov www.nasop.org May 22, 2013 The Honorable Bernard Sanders, Chairman Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging United States Senate 648 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Senator Sanders: The National Association of State Long- Term Care Ombudsman Programs (NASOP) is pleased to support your legislation, the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2013, which , among other things, would improve the capacity of State Long- Term Care Ombudsman Programs to advocate for residents of long- term care facilities. As you are well aware, the Long- Term Care Ombudsman Program (LTCOP) identifies, investigates and resolves complaints made by or on behalf of residents of long- term care facilities that affect their health, safety, welfare, or rights. Clarifying that residents have regular, timely, private and unimpeded access to LTCOP services strengthens residents’ rights to assistance from our Program. Improving the ability of the LTCOP to access all records pertaining to residents and clarifying that the LTCOP is a Health Oversight Agency improves the LTCOP’s ability to investigate and resolve resident complaints. Removing organizational conflicts of interest and clarifying the relationship between the State Long- Term Care Ombudsman and designated local entities ensures the independence of the LTCOP and strengthens the unity of statewide LTCOPs under the leadership of the State Long- Term Care Ombudsman. Restoring maintenance of effort provisions that protect federal and state funding for the Program and increasing funding in Title VII will protect our ability to ensure regular and timely access to Ombudsman services. Authorizing Title IIIE National Family Caregiver Program funding to support the work of the LTCOP in helping establish and assist family councils in long- term care facilities, identifies an unmet need to support family caregivers who continue to care for loved ones. We applaud your vision and efforts to improve the whole Act and especially your attention to the often- neglected l ong-term care system. NASOP enthusiastically supports your efforts and this important legislation that protects the rights of all residents of long- term care facilities. We look forward to working with you as the OAA reauthorization process moves ahead. Sincerely, Joseph Rodrigues President

William Lamb, President Sarah F. Wells, Executive Director Ph: 202.332.2275 Fax: 866.230.9789 www.theconsumervoice.org May 22, 2013 The Honorable Bernie Sanders United States Senate 332 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washing ton, DC 20510 Dear Senator Sanders, The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care (Consumer Voice) commends you for the introduction of the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2013 . We support this critical legislation, which is a much-needed first step towards reauthorizing essential Older Americans Act programs, and are particularly pleased that it includes provisions to protect the rights and well- being of elders living in long-term care facilities, as well as those at home and in the community. As you are aware, residents of long-term care facilities need effective advocacy in order to ensure that they receive the quality of care and quality of life they deserve and are entitled to by law. The purpose of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program is to provide residents with access to such advoca cy. The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2013 would strengthen and improve this program’s effectiveness in a number of important ways. This legislation would clarify both organiz ational and individual conflicts of interest within the program; clarify that the State Ombudsman is responsible for the management of the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, including the office’s fiscal management; improve resident access to ombudsmen; and e nsure that State Ombudsmen receive ongoing training. It would also enhance the ability of the Nati onal Ombudsman Resource Center to train and support both state and local ombudsmen by increasing the Center’s funding. Further more, older adults receiving services and supports at home also deserve similar protections to ensure they are receiving high-quality care and a good quality of life. Yet these individuals have few, if a ny, rights and protections under current law. The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2013 would guarantee home care consumers basic rights, including the right to safety, as well as information about costs, choice, and redress of grievances. The legislation would also advance the developm ent of ombudsman advocacy for home care consumers, who are frequently just as frail and vulnerable as nursing home residents.

May 17, 2013 The Honorable Bernie Sanders 332 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Dear Senator Sanders: The National Hispanic Council on Aging (NHCOA) – the leading national organization working to impr ove the lives of Hispanic older adults, their families, and caregivers – is proud to endorse the Older Ame ricans Act (OAA) Amendments of 2013 . We applaud you for your efforts to strengthen the services and supports of the OAA and help make them available to all older adults. Hispanic seniors often struggle to access services that are available in their communities, but it is NHCOA’s hope that your amendments will help them get the assistance they need to live independently and in the best possible health. The population of older adults in the United States is growing quickly, and the OAA needs to reflect this changing demographic. NHCOA strongly supports the increased funding requested for the vitally important meals, transportation, caregiver support, and employment training that the OAA provides. F or many years, parts of the OAA have gone without funding increases. The increased funding of the OAA Amendments of 2013 will allow service providers to meet the increased demand created by the growing population of older adults. NHCOA is also happy that the OAA Amendments of 2013 place a priority on the delivery of services and supports in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. In addition to growing larger, the population of older adults in the U.S. is also become more diverse. Currently, cultural and linguistic barriers make it difficult for Hispanic older adults to access available services. The OAA Amendments of 2013 help break down those barriers. Prioritizing services that meet the unique cultural and linguistic needs of older adults is a tremendous step forward for the OAA. Thank you for leadership and for your support of older adults. NHCOA looks forward to working with you to further improve the lives of Hispanic older adults, their families, and caregivers. Sincerely, Yanira Cruz, Dr.PH President & CEO

1140 19th Street, NW ∙ Suite 550 ∙ Washington, DC ∙ 20036 ∙ wiserwomen.org May 22, 2013 The Honorable Bernard Sanders Chairman, Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions U.S. Senate, 648 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Dear Chairman Sanders: It is with great pleasure that I write in support of the Older Americans Act Reauthorization legislation that you are introducing this week. Please add the Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement (WISER) to your list of supporters. I truly appreciate all of your efforts to strengthen and expand the programs under the OAA in both this Congress and in the 112th Congress. The importance of the Older Americans Act to millions of older adults should not be underestimated. The impact and influence of the OAA is felt far and wide but intimately, too, in the meals that seniors eat every day, and in the protections and assistance that individuals receive from the many and varied programs and services. The programs of WISER and the National Education and Resource Center on Women and Retirement Planning are great examples of OAA programs that reach older adults in one of the most important ways possible: by protecting women from financial exploitation and poverty in their older years. As you know, the center, administered by WISER, plays a critical role in addressing financial literacy and predatory practices. Predatory practices cost Americans $25 billion annually, robbing women, particularly elderly women, of precious assets and putting their home ownership at risk. The face of the victim is often a “cash poor, house rich” elderly widow, often African American, less-educated, and vulnerable. These are the individuals that make up WISER’s audience and the people to whom WISER focuses its outreach. Being a target when you are at this vulnerable stage of your life has extreme consequences – being swindled out of your life savings is not only devastating but also life threatening. Older women are targeted not only by strangers who are con artists, unscrupulous salespeople, contractors or others, but by those who are known to them and who have power over them such as family caregivers or someone with a power of attorney or other fiduciary obligation. WISER has partnered with the National Adult Protective Services Association to develop education materials, training programs, and outreach to educate, recognize, and prevent elder financial exploitation. In closing, let me again thank you for introducing this important piece of legislation that supports some of the most effective and essential programs that we offer older Americans. Please let me know how I may be of assistance during the upcoming legislative process. Sincerely, Cindy Hounsell President

May 20, 2013 The Honorable Bernard Sanders United States Senate 332 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Senator Sanders, We are delighted to express our firm support for the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act. We are particularly pleased with the CPI-E provision, as discussed below. Since 1965, this Act has helped millions of seniors live with independence and dignity within their own homes and communities . The Older Americans Act created the primary organizing tool, the Administration on Aging, statewide Area Agencies on Aging, as well as programs like Meals on Wheels, and various volunteer services. These programs have allowed thousands of older adults the flexibility and autonomy in deciding the type of environment they would like to live in during their later years. This reauthorization addresses the shortfalls of seniors’ current economic security by directing the Bureau of Labor Statistics to create a more robust version of the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) within a 2 year window. Current benefits are very modest. The current CPI does not adequately reflect seniors’ disproportionally large housing and health care expenditures relative to other age groups. As a consequence, benefits erode over time. This CPI-E would create a more accurate measure of the true cost of living seniors experience, which would help alleviate some financial strain as they age. The Older Americans Act reauthorization is vital to ensuring the wellbeing of the growing senior population in the United States. The coordinated systems of services enacted by this reauthorization would revitalize an essential piece of legislation in order to accommodate the needs of the growing senior population. We applaud your continued leadership on the Older Americans Act, and we are honored to endorse this legislation. Sincerely, Nancy Altman Eric Kingson Coalition Co-Chair Coalition Co-Chair

May 2 2, 2013 The Honorable Bernard Sanders, Chairman Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee United States Senate 428 Senate Dirksen Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Dear Chairman Sanders : The National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys wishes to express its support for your bill, the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2013. We thank you and your staff for the many hours that you have spent listening to stakeholders from across the country, establishing goals for this reauthorization, and drafting the bill that you plan to introduce this week. This is an important step in what should be an open, bipartisan, and bicameral process of reauthorizing this important law. In particular, we believ e that your continuing commitment to strengthen the quality of and access to legal services for older adults is essential in this reauthorization. In addition, your provisions that recognize that the long-term care ombudsman program can be significantly i mproved by changes to the current law that will not demand any additional resources are greatly appreciated . Moreover , your bill adds important language consistent with the Elder Justice Act that will promote the fight against elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation on the federal, state, and local levels. NAELA is a professional association consisting of more than 4,300 attorneys who advocate for the rights of seniors and people with disabilities. Elder law attorneys are specialized and trained in a va riety of areas in the law that address an individual’s long- term care needs. We thank you for including our perspectives in the process and your steadfast commitment to providing much needed services to older adults, particularly those in the greatest eco nomic and social need. Our members see clients every day who have benefited or could benefit from OAA programs, and we are strong supporters of its reauthorization in the 113 th Congress. Please let us know what we can do to help you in this ef fort. Sincerely, Peter G. Wacht, CAE Gregory S. French, CELA, CAP Executive Director President

May 21, 2013 The Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) and the Association of Jewish Family & Children’s Agencies (AJFCA) are pleased to endorse the Older Americans Act reauthorization bill. We urge Senators to support this legislation and reauthorize the Older Americans Act with sufficient funding to meet the needs of seniors as soon as possible. JFNA represents 154 Jewish Federations & over 300 independent Jewish communities. The Jewish Federations, collectively among the top 10 charities on the continent, protects and enhances the well-being of Jews worldwide through the values of tikkun olam (repairing the world), tzedakah (charity and social justice) and Torah (Jewish learning). AJFCA is the membership association for approximately 125 Jewish Family Service agencies across the United States and Canada. Ranging in size from small departments of local Jewish Federations to some of the largest human services agencies in North America, our members provide vital services to clients of all ages, faiths and economic backgrounds. They counsel families, feed the hungry, assist the elderly and protect the vulnerable. We are united by the values of our Jewish tradition and work together toward our common goal of tikkun olam , repairing the world. Our network is comprised of experts in aging services for all seniors and we make up the primary social service providers for Holocaust survivors in the United States. As people who work with Holocaust survivors in their homes and in the community, we are reminded each day of the importance of enabling Holocaust survivors to remain safely at home with their communities. The negative effects of isolation can be devastating for survivors who also face financial challenges and fewer family members to help care for them. The ability to help provide that comfort and quality of life will be enhanced if the Responding to Urgent needs of Survivors of the Holocaust (RUSH) Act, whi ch is incorporated into this reauthorization bill, were to become law. We also strongly support efforts to provide congregate and home-delivered meals that are culturally appropriate based on religious or ethnic requirement or health-related concerns; funding of Title IV to help develop and carry out innovative demonstration projects that advance and sustain healthy, efficient, and independent community-based aging; strengthening the National Family Caregiver Support program; and funding for the Senior Community Service Employment Program; among other important initiatives supported by the Older Americans Act. JFN A and AJFCA look forward to cooperating with members of the Senate to move reauthorization of the Older Americans Act forward. For additional information, please contact Shelley Rood at JFNA at shelley.rood@jewishfederations.org or (202) 736- Sincerely, Association of Jewish Family & Children’s Agencies The Jewish Federations of North America

May 22, 2013 The Honorable Bernie Sanders Chairman, Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee 322 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Dear Chairman Sanders, On behalf of the 158 Goodwill Industries agencies in the United States, I am writing in support of proposed changes to Title V of the Older Americans Act contained in the Older Americans Act Amendments Act of 2013. The Older Americans Act (OAA) was the first federal -level legislation aimed at providing comprehensive services for older adults. Since its original passage in 1964, tens of millions of seniors have benefited from the services provided by the OAA. Among those services are the employment services provided under Title V -Community Service Senior Opportunities Act, commonly referred to as the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP). SCSEP is a program administered by the United States Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration that helps low-income people who are 55 and older to return to or remain active in the workforce. The recession that began in 2008 seriously hurt the standard of living for many seniors, moving many from middle- income to low -income brackets. At a time when our fragile eco nomy continues to struggle to recover from the recession, the importance of the SCSEP program has never been greater. The Older American Act Amendments of 2013 will require the Assistant Secretary for Aging and the Secretary of Labor to conduct a feasibili ty study and submit a report to Congress on the proposed transfer of the Senior Community Service Employment Program from the Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration to the Health and Human Services Administration on Aging. While Goodwi ll supports keeping the SCSEP program located within the Department of Labor, it also supports the study language that will be part of the proposed legislation. Goodwill believes such a study would provide greater clarity on Title V’s interconnection with other Titles within OAA and provide Congress and the Administration with more data on how significant SCSEP’s role is as a workforce development program for our nation’s most at-risk seniors. We appreciate your efforts on behalf of older Americans, especially in these difficult times. Please feel free to contact Paul Seifert, Senior Public Policy Specialist at paul.seifert@goodwill.org or at (240) 333- Sincerely, Jim Gibbons, President & CEO Goodwill Industries International

We sincerely appreciate the efforts you and your staff have made to address the issue of elder abuse, neglect and exploitation in your bill. In particular, we want to congratulate you on adding victims of elder abuse to the category of those who are in “greatest social need.” This is very important because older adults who have been physically or financially abused or exploited are particularly vulnerable individuals in our society and they deserve the highest level of protection we can afford them. In addition, your bill helps to make consistent the approach and definitions used in the Elder Justice Act, and your bill makes perman ent the National Resource Center for Women and Retirement and the National Adult Protective Services Resource Center. Further, your support for the State Home Care Ombudsman Program as well as your support for the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Progr am is greatly appreciated. We feel that this bill is an excellent beginning to the work of reauthorizing the Older Americans Act and we look forward to continuing to work with you and the Subcommittee throughout the proce ss.

May 22 , 2013 The Honorable Bernie Sanders Chair, Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions 428 Senate Dirksen Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Dear Senator Sanders: Thank you for your Older Americans Act reauthorization bill and its many improvements to help aging parents caring for their adul t children with disabilities . The D evelopmental Disabilities , Autism and Family Support Task Force of the Consortium for Ci tizens with Disabilities (CCD) greatly appreciates the proposed amendments to the National Family Caregiver Support program (NFCSP) and the Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ARDCs) . The NFCSP was the first federal program to recognize the needs of the nation’s family caregivers who provide the vast majority of long -term services and supports. NFCSP not only funds respite, but individual counseling, support groups, and caregiver training f or family caregivers, primarily for those who are caring for the aging population. Unfortunately, the NFC SP currently is only available to caregivers of persons age 60 and over. Your bill would make the program available to the increasing number of Americ ans who need it by including caregivers of their adult child ren (age 19 to 59) with disabilities . This needed improvement would not come a moment too soon. There are over 730,000 caregive rs of persons with intellectual and developmental disabil ities who are over the age of 60 and this number is projected to grow substantially with the aging of the baby boom generation. People with intellectual and developmental disabilities are also living longer due to medical advances. As parents of these individuals age, they will require more support to be able to continue providing care to their adult children and avoiding costly and unwanted institutional placement . The aging of the caregiver population is central to another welcome provision in the bill – the a ddition of ADRCS assist ing aging caregivers and adults with disabilities with future planning . The lack of family future planning often result s in inappropriate residential placements , loss of intended inheritance, and jeopardizes access to needed services for adults with disabilities as they age. For instance, long waiting lists preclude appropriate community -based residential options for many individuals with lifelong disabilities . Providing future planning services will provide immense relief to aging caregivers who frequently report that they are “afraid to die.” More than at any other time, when M edicaid , Medicare, and Social Security are being severely threatened, helping family caregivers to continue providing long-term se rvices and supports is good public policy . We look forward to working with you on the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act that will improve services for our nation’s caregivers. 1825 K Street, NW, Suite 1200 • Washington, DC 20006 • PH 202- 783- 2229 • FAX 202- 783-8250 • Info@c- c-d.org • www.c -c-d.org

May 21, 2013 The Hono rable Bernard Sanders, Chairman Retirement and Aging Subcommittee Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee United States Senate Washington, DC 20510 Dear Chairman Sanders: On behalf of the millions of members and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, I am writing to thank you for introducing the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2011, which reauthorizes the Older Americans Act (OAA). We share your hope that this legislation and other proposals to strengthen the OAA will receive bipartisan support in Congress early in 2012. Older Americans Act programs – such as in -home assistance, home -delivered and congregate meals, respite for family caregivers, preventive health services, job training and placement, and legal services - benefit individuals and their families. By helping seniors stay as independent as possible in their homes and communities, these programs also save federal and state government resources from being spent on sometimes unnecessary and often much more expensive care in hospitals and nursing homes. We understand that your legislation improves the OAA programs. In addition, your bill acknowledges that there is simply not enough money allocated for OAA programs to meet the needs of our growing elderly population. The National Committee also applauds you for the provision in the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2011 which requires the Secretary of Labor to revise and improve the experimental price index for the elderly, commonly referred to as the CPI -E, so that it can be considered as a replacement for the consumer price index that is being used to adjust Social Security benefits for inflation. We believe that the CPI -E is based on a market basket of goods that more accurately reflects the spending patterns of the elderly and thus is a better index for the purpose of protecting seniors from the harmful effects of inflation. Revising and improving the experim ental CPI -E is an essential first step in its adoption as the CPI of record for the Social Security program. Thank you for your leadership on the Older Americans Act reauthorization. We look forward to working with you to strengthen these important programs that go a long way toward ensuring economic security and independence for older Americans and their family caregivers. Sincerely, Sherrie Dornberger Sherrie Dornberger, RN, CDONA, CDP, GDCN, FACDONA Executive Director NADONA/LTC 11353 Reed Hartman Hwy., Suite 210 Cincinnati, OH. 45241

May 22, 2013 To: Sophie Kasimow, Staff Director, HELP Subcommittee on Primary Health & Aging From: Lisa Pugh, Public Policy Coordinator, Wisconsin’s Disability Policy Partnership Re: Older Americans Act reauthorization bill I am writing to indicate our agency’s support for the Older Americans Act reauthorization bill to be introduced by Senator Sanders. Our agency had previously worked with Senator Kohl’s office on many of these important issues. This bill includes an important fix to the National Family Caregiver Support Program to include older relative caregivers of adults with disabilities. It also amends the core functions of ADRCs to include that they assist aging caregivers and adults with disabilities with future planning. The language on caregiver assessments will also be extremely helpful for aging caregivers of adults with disabilities. Thank you for your work on this bill. We look forward to providing additional input and supporting its passage. cc: Senator Baldwin staff Billy Gendell, Senate HELP Committee

AMDA is the professional association of nursing home medical directors, nursing home attending physicians, and other professionals practicing in the post-acute and long term care continuum. We work to ensure excellence in patient care and to promote the delivery of quality post- acute and long term care medicine. AMDA supports the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2013, particularly its provisions to strengthen the eldercare workforce and continue funding the long term care ombudsman program. Provisions in your legislation which contribute to these important goals include those that strengthen support for family and informal caregivers through grants to states to conduct assessments of family or informal caregiver needs, test new innovative models of person and family- centered care that encourage well -coordinated, interdisciplinary team care, test models that provide direct -care workers with additional training for new roles, and direct the Administration on Aging to work with other federal agencies to identify and address eldercare workforce shortages. Also included is support for the Long Term Care Ombudsman Program, which addresses the many and varied problems facing long term care residents. State Ombudsmen play an important role in protecting nursing home residents, especially in promoting the development of citizen organizations and family residence councils. AMDA looks forward to continued engagement in the OAA reauthorization process. Our nation faces a severe and growing shortage of eldercare providers with the skills and training to meet the unique health care needs of older adults. AMDA is committed to supporting the reauthorization of the OAA as it invests in building and maintaining an eldercare workforce that supports well-coordinated, high quality care for older adults. Sincerely, Christopher Laxton, CAE Executive Director

May 21, 2013 The Honorable Bernie Sanders United States Senate 332 Dirksen Building Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Senator Sanders: We are writing to extend our most grateful thanks to you for writing and introducing the reauthorization of The Older Amer icans Act. Donated Dental Services (DDS) is a national initiative sponsored by our organization which is affiliated with the American Dental Association. We provide comprehensive pro bono dental care through a network of more than 15,000 volunteer dentists assisted by 3,200 participating laboratories. The program is overwhelmed by requests for assistance from individuals who require dental care to address their medical needs for conditions such as diabetes, cancers, cardiovascular diseases, renal dysfunc tion, autoimmune diseases, and mental health challenges. They cannot afford the dental care and have no insurance for it. Many more dentists are willing to participate in the DDS program and similar charitable service initiatives. However, they will not be effectively engaged without the social work infrastructure such project s require to match needy patients with available dental volunteers. The provision in the Reauthorization of the Older Americans Act authorizing support for that purpose will mobili ze the dental profession’s service potential to produce significant treatment for many very vulnerable individuals. And because of the eligibility focus on needy elderly, disabled, and medically compromised individuals, many of whom are Medicare and/or Medicaid beneficiaries, this process will likely save more money than it costs, since costly medical complications will undoubtedly be prevented. Again, we re extremely appreciative of all your continuing efforts to improve services to our nation’s elderly and disabled members, and we’re eager to assist you in any way we can in helping to bring your efforts to fruition. Respectfully, Bruce Vladeck, Ph.D. Larry Coffee, DDS Board Member Founder and CEO

May 22, 2013 The Honorable Bernie Sanders Chairman Primary Health and Aging Subcommittee SD- 648 Dirksen Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Dear Chairman Sanders: On behalf of our 156,000 members, we thank you for including important oral health provisions in 2013 the Older Americans Act (OAA) reauthorization. We believe that these additions are important for increasing access to needed oral health care for senior citizens. Sec. 425 in the bill provides for a grant program that will support national dental programs to coordinate medically recommended dental care for low income individuals. The dental care will be provided by volunteer dentists at no cost to patients who have medical conditions – like diabetes, cancer, autoimmune disease, kidney disease or need heart or joint replacements or transplants. This legislation is needed because Medicare, which does not cover routine dental services, will not pay for the coordination of medically recommended dental care, thereby preventing many underserved patients from getting needed care or compromising an existing chronic condition. This program will reduce Medicare and Medicaid costs. For example, kidney dialysis patients need to be able to consume enough protein to stabilize their condition. If a patient cannot eat properly, physicians have to insert a feeding tube. A 2001 study reported that the estimated one year cost of feeding a patient through a tube is $31,832. Under this bill, a patient in this condition would receive free oral health services from a volunteer dentist and avoid the need of a feeding tube. It has been estimated that the $2 million grant investment authorized in this bill will return roughly $13 million in medical ly-necessary, pro bono dental treatment and will help 5,000 Medicare and/or Medicaid beneficiaries. We are also pleased that you have included dental expenses in Sec. 209 of the bill, which requires the Secretary of Labor to revise the Experimental Price Index for the Elderly commonly referred to as the CPI-E. Adults increasingly are keeping their teeth well into old age, placing increasing demands for services on the dental profession as well as incurring more expense as consumers. Dental care is paid for much differently than most medical care; therefore indexing dental expenditures will be helpful in understanding the impact of these expenses on the elderly. We anticipate that the greater number of elderly individuals requiring dental care will change the way dentistry is practiced in the future. Including dental

May 22, 2013 expenses in the CPI-E will help the dental profession better understand the impact of those expenditures. Thank you again for including these oral health provisions in the Older American Act reauthorization. This is the first time in the history of the OAA that oral health care has been included. Sincerely, Robert A. Faiella, D.M.D., M.M.Sc. President Kathleen T. O’Loughlin, D.M.D., M.P.H. Executive Director

1 May 22, 2013 The Honorable Bernie Sanders Chair, Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions 428 Senate Dirksen Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Dear Senator Sanders: On behalf of The Arc of the United States, I wish to express my sincere appreciation for your Older Americans Act reauthorization bill . This legislation offers significant improvements for our nation’s family caregivers who provide the vast majority of long term services and supports. For more than 60 years, The Arc has worked to ensure that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities have the supports and services they need to live as independently and productively as possible. Through our network of over 700 state and local chapters and 140,000 members, we have helped to create basic protections and opportunities for the more than 7 million people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in the U.S. More than 65 million Americans provide care for a loved one who has a disability, is chronically ill, or is elderly and spend an average of 20 hours per week providing care. For caregivers of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) the levels of responsibility are not only greater, but frequently lifelong. There are approximately 2.9 million family caregivers of persons with I/DD in the U.S. According to The Arc’s Family and Individual Needs for Disability Supports (FINDS) survey, most of these family caregivers provide more than 40 hours of care per week (including 40% who provide more than 80 hours of care per week). As our society continues to depend on the active engagement of family caregivers for the s upport of individuals with I/DD, it is essential to meet the needs of those caregivers to continue providing care in the community instead of more costly and unwanted institutions. Family caregivers of people with I/DD urgently need the services provided by the National Family Caregiver Support program (NFCSP) created by the Older Americans Act . Your legislation would finally make the NFCSP available to the majority of them who have been excluded from the program – caregivers of persons with I/DD who are age 18 to 59. As a result, many more families will be able to access essential respite, counseling, training, support group, and other services that help them to keep their loved ones at home . In addition, the legislation would greatly help the growing number of aging caregivers to help plan for the future of their adult children with disabilities. Over 75% of adults with lifelong

--- Page 26 ---
2 disabilities live at home with family caregivers and more than a quarter live with aging caregivers over 60 years of age. By expanding the role of Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) to begin providing future planning services, many aging caregivers will be able to achieve the peace of mind that they deserve. P lanning for the future when aging caregivers can no longer provide care involves specific legal and financial considerations – such as special needs trusts, guardianship, and less restrictive protections – as well as future residential and lifestyle preferences. Access to these planning services will reduce the likelihood of inappropriate residential placements, loss of intended inheritance, and limited access to needed services for their adult children with disabilities. Helping family caregivers to continue providing long -term services and supports is a matter of ethical and fiscal responsibility . We look forward to working with you on the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act that will improve services for our nation’s caregivers. Sincerely, Annie Acosta Policy Advocate The Arc of the United States

May 23, 2013 Dear Chairman Sanders: The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) supports the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2013. AGS is a national non‐profit organization comprised of over 6,000 health professionals, including physicians, nurses, researchers, medical educators, pharmacists, physician assistants, social workers, health care administrators, and others who specialize in geriatrics. We are the nation's largest multi‐disciplinary health professional organization dedicated to improving the health, independence and quality of life of older people through initiatives in clinical practice, research and professional and public education. We very much appreciate your efforts to move forward with reauthorization of the Older Americans Act (OAA) in the 113th Congress. Reauthorization of the OAA provides an important opportunity to modernize the aging services network and its programs in order to build a health professional workforce with the skills and training to meet the health and long‐term care services and supports (LTSS) needs of older adults. As you know, our nation already faces a severe and growing shortage of healthcare professionals with the training and skills to meet the unique health care needs of older adults. We are pleased to see provisions in the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2013 to address workforce shortages and support family caregivers. Several provisions in your legislation contribute to these important goals, including requiring the Administration on Aging to work with other federal agencies to identify and address workforce shortages in the field of aging. The bill also tests new innovative models of person and family‐centered care that encourage well‐coordinated, interdisciplinary team care. Additional components provide grants to states to conduct assessments of family or informal caregiver needs as well as the testing of models that provide direct care workers with further training for new roles. Chairman Sanders, AGS appreciates your leadership on this important legislation and looks forward to continued engagement in the OAA reauthorization process. Should you have any additional questions, please contact Alanna Goldstein, Assistant Director of Public Affairs and Advocacy, at agoldstein@americangeriatrics.org or 212‐308‐1414.
