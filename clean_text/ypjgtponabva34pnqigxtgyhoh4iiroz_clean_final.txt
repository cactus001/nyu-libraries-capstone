BACKGROUND On December 4, 1993, Carlson issued the following: To: Greg Johnson, President, Local 519From: Keith Carlson, ManagerSubject: Work rule additions and clarificationsDate: December 4, 1993The following items were discussed at our meeting of November 30, 1993. An official notice of rule changeis forthcoming. Please review these changes and let me know if you have any other ideas. No Bus Operator may work more than 12.5 hours in one calendar day. In the eventan operator must be relieved to keep fromworking more than 12.5 hours, the operatorwill be relieved at the Transit Center(5th & State), and at such time to allowhis/her relief to work a minimum of twohours. Under no circumstances is anemployee guaranteed 12.5 hours pay if theymust be relieved prior to the end of ashift. Extra list operators must physically work a minimum of 5.5 hours on Sunday to becredited with a Sunday worked on the"Extra List Sunday Schedule". The onlyexception would be if an extra listoperator takes a paid vacation or personalbusiness day. As for pay for time between pieces of work. While we agreed in principle, I amreluctant to try to word a rule that mayconflict with the labor agreement.Section 13, "Operator's Pull Out Time",addresses

If you need further information please contact me, thank you for your help in this matter. When Carlson did not receive a response to his letter of December 4, 1993, he issued the following letter of January 5, 1994: To: All MTU Employees From: Keith Carlson, ManagerSubject: Addition to MTU Employee's ManualDate: January 5, 1994The following shall become part of the Municipal Transit Utility Employee's manual. Effective dateJanuary 12, 1994. SECTION 3 "GENERAL PROCEDURES"3.22 Bus Operator Length of Day No Bus Operator may work more than 12.5 hours in one calendar day. In the event an operator must be relieved to keep from working more than 12.5 hours,the operator will be relieved at theTransit Center (5th & State), and at suchtime to allow his/her relief to work aminimum of two hours. Under nocircumstances is an operator guaranteed12.5 hours of pay if they must be relievedprior to the end of the shift. 16 Extra List Policies Extra list operators must physically work a minimum of 5.5 hours on Sunday to becredited with a Sunday worked on the"Extra List Sunday Schedule". The onlyexception would be if an extra listoperator takes a paid vacation or personalbusiness day. The Union responded by filing a grievance dated January 10, 1994, and which stated as follows: NATURE OF GRIEVANCE (DETAILED STATEMENT): The proposed work rule change dated January 5, 1994. Local 519,believes that this rule change affects both wages, andhours so it must be negotiated.

-6-CLAUSE OF CONTRACT VIOLATED SEC. 6 Management Rights Sec. 22 Rules State Statute 111.70 SETTLEMENT DESIRED For the City not to implement this proposed work rule, but to negotiate it as required by law. On January 17, 1994, Transit Manager Carlson issued the following letter to Union President Gregory Johnson: This letter is to confirm the Step #2 answer to the above captioned grievance. In this case, the grievant alleges that the Municipal Transit Utility (MTU) violated Section 6, ManagementRights, Section 22, Rules and Regulations, of theagreement and State Statute 111.70. The work rule, 3.22 Bus Operator Length of Day, is consistent with what we discussed at our November 30,1993 meeting and outlined in a memo to you onDecember 4, 1993. See attached memo. In fact, it wasat your suggestion that we set the number of hours. Inaddition, the two hour minimum required in this rule isalso consistent with a number of other situations thatoccur on a regular basis at the MTU. This grievance is denied. The memo attached to this letter was the memo of December 4, 1993. On February 11, 1994, Personnel Director James Geissner issued the following letter to Union President Johnson: This letter is to confirm that the time limits to hold a hearing and answer the above captioned grievance havebeen extended by mutual consent.

--- Page 6 ---
-7-After a thorough discussion of this case at two (2) separate negotiating sessions leading to a new 1994-1995 agreement, the parties were unable to resolve thematter. In those negotiations, the City informed theUnion that it intended to continue to implement thework rule which became effective January 12, 1994. Please consider this letter as the grievance answer. The City does not believe that it violated the 1993contract when it implemented the changes described in amemo dated January 5, 1994 to all employees.Therefore, this grievance is denied. Thereafter, the grievance was submitted to arbitration.POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES: Union The City has unilaterally implemented a work rule which limits all drivers to no more than 12.5 hours of available work in a given dayirrespective of any indications of driver impairment or safety threat. Thework rule which has been unilaterally changed by the City specifically placesno limit on the number of hours that an employe may work in a given day and,more importantly, specifically mandates that an employe is entitled toavailable overtime based upon seniority. Contrary to the argument of the City,Union President Johnson did not request the establishment of the changed workrule. The unilaterally implemented work rule change is contrary to the clear and consistent practice in which the City has always allowed and always paidemployes for time beyond 12.5 work hours in a given day. Not only have driversbeen permitted to work more than 12.5 hours in a given day, but the City hasscheduled drivers in excess of 12.5 hours in a given day. By virtue of the contract, work rule, past practice, and work schedules of the parties, the City has violated the collective bargaining agreement byseeking to impose the 12.5 hour limitation on all employes. Additionally, theunilateral conduct of the City is in violation of the Municipal EmploymentRelations Act. In arguing that the impact on overtime eligibility is de minimis , the City begs the question. Individual employes are denied pay as a result of the implementation of this work rule and it is irrelevant that other bargainingunit employes may work the disputed hours. Contrary to the argument of the City, the work rule was not a subject of negotiation when the parties bargained their most recent contract. The Citylay in the weeds and implemented the changed work rule four (4) days after thenew contract went into effect. The City's arguments, in which it seeks to justify the unilateral change in the work rule, are appropriate for interest arbitration. A grievancearbitrator, however, cannot alter the terms of the collective bargainingcontract. The City asserts that one of the reasons for its decision to impose an hours restriction is an overriding concern for safety. Conspicuous by itsabsence in this record, is any credible evidence that the practice of theparties has in any way constituted an unsafe condition.

--- Page 7 ---
-8-Bargaining unit employes may have incurred worker's compensation injuries. There is, however, not one shred of competent evidence to suggestthat hours of work are responsible for any injury caused to an employe.Moreover, if the City believes that hours of work were the cause of anyparticular employe's condition, it has the remedy to submit the employe tophysical examination to make that determination. The Union does not criticize the City for seeking ways to efficiently operate the Transit System. However, the desire to save money does not providethe City with the right to abrogate the terms of the collective bargainingagreement. Rather, the City should negotiate the desired change with theUnion. The grievance must be sustained. CITY: By virtue of State Statute 111.70(1)(a) and Section 6 of the collective bargaining agreement, implementation of the work rule is both a right and aresponsibility of the employer. The work rule was implemented to protect boththe public and the drivers. If the work rule results in any loss in wages, such loss is minimal. The application of the work rule would be infrequent and it is likely that any lossof pay for one bargaining unit employe would be gained by another. The City has the longest work day of cities with a similar population. Bus Drivers cannot be expected to work fourteen or fifteen hours straight andremain alert to safely drive the city streets and transport members of thepublic. The City's twelve and one-half (12.5) hour work day is not onlyreasonable, but it actually goes beyond the policy that similar transportationemployers have. The testimony of the City's Worker's Compensation Manager andTransit Manager Carlson indicate that extensive hours on the job results inincreased worker's compensation injuries and lost time. Following the settlement of the Virgil Halderson grievance, the parties met to discuss methods for avoiding future grievances. While Transit ManagerCarlson wished to maintain the status quo , deciding each case on the basis of common sense, the Union wanted a set number of hours established. At thismeeting, the Union President told Carlson that "it is your right as the boss toset a time limit, just set the number of hours." The memo of December 4, 1993,contains the work rule which the Union requested at this meeting. Although the Union was invited to comment on the work rule, the Union made no attempt to respond to this issue, not even at the contract negotiationsession on December 28, 1993. After a month of silence from the Union, theCity posted the memo concerning the rule which was to take effect January 12,1994. The Union seeks to obtain in arbitration that which it failed to requestin bargaining. The arbitrator is without authority to add to, or subtractfrom, the terms of the contract. The number of hours paid should equal the number of hours worked. If the rule were administered as the Union would like, then the City would payfourteen and one-half hours (14 1/2) for thirteen hours of work. This is bothunreasonable and inconsistent with the legislative intent of the MunicipalEmployment Relations Act. It is also inconsistent with the conclusions of theDoolittle Report regarding the reform of various timekeeping inefficiencies. The grievance arbitration forum is not the appropriate forum to litigate alleged violations of Sec. 111.70, Stats. The City has not violated thecollective bargaining agreement. The grievance is without merit and should bedismissed.

--- Page 8 ---
-9-DISCUSSION: Section 3, Grievance Procedure, of the parties' 1994-95 collective bargaining agreement defines a grievance as "Matters involving the interpretation, application, or enforcement of this agreement." Thus, as theCity argues, the grievance arbitration forum is not the appropriate forum tolitigate violations of state statutes, such as the Municipal EmploymentRelations Act. Accordingly, the undersigned has not given any consideration tothe Union argument that the City has committed a prohibited practice inviolation of Sec. 111.70, Stats., by unilaterally imposing the disputed workrule. The Union argues that the City cannot implement Work Rule 3.22 because this work rule violates a past practice of not limiting the number of hoursthat a driver may work in a day. For the sake of argument, the undersigned hasassumed that there is such a past practice. 1/ The parties' collective bargaining agreement does not contain a maintenance of standards provision. Nor does it contain any other provisionwhich incorporates the parties' past practices into the collective bargainingagreement. Additionally, the contract language is silent with respect to thelength of the Bus Driver work day. Thus, the past practice alleged by theUnion is an unwritten practice, existing apart from the contract. 1/ The City denies that there is a past practice of not limiting the number of hours worked in a day. According to the City, the Transit Manager hasreserved, and exercised, the right to use discretion in limiting thenumber of hours worked in a day.

--- Page 9 ---
-1 0-While there is disagreement among arbitrators on this issue, Arbitrator Richard Mittenthal has presented the most cogent view on the general subject ofwhen, and under what circumstances, such a practice can be terminated.Arbitrator Mittenthal writes: Consider first a practice which is, apart from any basis in the agreement, an enforceable condition ofemployment on the theory that the agreement subsumesthe continuance of existing conditions. Such apractice cannot be unilaterally changed during the lifeof the agreement. For, as I explained earlier in thispaper, if a practice is not discussed duringnegotiations most of us are likely to infer that theagreement was executed on the assumption that thepractice would remain in effect. The inference is based largely on the parties' acquiescence in the practice. If either side should,during the negotiation of a later agreement, object tothe continuance of this practice, it could not beinferred from the signing of a new agreement that theparties intended the practice to remain in force.Without their acquiescence, the practice would nolonger be a binding condition of employment. In faceof a timely repudiation of a practice by one party,they must have the practice written into the agreementif it is to continue to be binding. 2/ Negotiation of the parties' 1994-95 agreement commenced on or about November 8, 1993. On November 30, 1993, Union President Johnson and TransitManager Carlson met to discuss several issues, including the right of the Cityto limit the number of hours worked by Bus Drivers. On December 4, 1993,Transit Manager Carlson issued a memo advising Union President Johnson that theCity intended to establish a work rule addressing the length of the Bus Driverwork day. The work rule contained in this memo is identical to Work Rule 3.22,which is the subject of this dispute. 3/ Transit Manager Carlson invited theUnion to respond to his memo of December 4, 1993. When the Union failed torespond, Transit Manager Carlson issued his memo of January 5, 1994, in whichemployes were advised that the City would implement Work Rule 3.22. 2/ "Past Practice and the Culmination of Collective Bargaining Agreements," Proceedings of the NAA (1961). 3/ As the Union argues, it is not evident that Union President Johnson requested the language contained in Work Rule 3.22. Nor is it evidentthat Union President Johnson expressed agreement with this language.

--- Page 10 ---
-1 1-Although the effective date of the contract is January 1, 1994, the parties did not reach a settlement of this contract until February 1, 1994.Contrary to the argument of the Union, the City did not "lie in the weeds" andimplement the work rule four days after the contract went into effect. Rather,as the record demonstrates, the Union received timely notice of the City'sintent to implement Work Rule 3.22 and the Union had ample opportunity to raisethe issue in contract negotiations. Assuming arguendo, that the past practice relied upon by the Union did exist during the term of the parties' 1993agreement, the City repudiated the past practice when it notified the Union ofthe City's intent to implement Work Rule 3.22. Applying the rationale of Arbitrator Mittenthal to the facts of this case, the undersigned is persuaded that, if the Union wished the allegedpractice to continue to be binding upon the parties, it was incumbent upon theUnion to have the alleged practice written into the 1993-94 agreement. TheUnion did not do so. Despite the Union's arguments to the contrary, the recorddoes not demonstrate that Work Rule 3.22 violates any binding past practice ofthe parties. The City relies upon Section 6, Management Rights, which provides the City with the right "to make reasonable work rules or regulations governing conduct or safety pursuant to Section 22." Section 22, recognizes thatemployes are subject to "the present rules and regulations of the City and suchreasonable work rules and regulations as it may hereinafter adopt." A Section 22 challenge to a work rule is initiated by requesting a conference within one calendar week of the time that the work rule is posted bythe City. Since the work rule was effective January 12, 1994, and the Uniondoes not argue that the City failed to follow the contractual postingrequirement, the undersigned assumes that the work rule was posted on January5, 1994, the date of Transit Manager Carlson's memo. The testimony of Union President Johnson establishes that the Union met with the City to discuss the grievance on Work Rule 3.22 prior to filing thewritten grievance. Since the written grievance is dated January 10, 1994, itis evident that the Union did ask for a conference on the proposed work rulewithin one calendar week of the time that the work rule was posted. The undersigned is satisfied that the Union has preserved its contractual right to challenge Work Rule 3.22. Given the City's Section 22 right to adoptreasonable rules and regulations, Work Rule 3.22 must be upheld unless therecord demonstrates that Work Rule 3.22 is not reasonable. Section 22 expressly states that the City may not adopt any work rule or regulation "which is inconsistent with the terms of the agreement." Since awork rule which violates this stricture would be unreasonable, the undersignedturns to the issue of whether or not Work Rule 3.22 is inconsistent with theterms of the parties' agreement.

--- Page 11 ---
-1 2-The Union relies upon the contractual provisions of guarantee time, overtime and work week to argue that the contract reflects the parties'agreements concerning hours of work. The provisions relied upon by the Unionare contained in Sections 14 and 15 of the contract. Section 14 contains two paragraphs. Paragraph One sets forth circumstances in which an employe is guaranteed a minimum wage equal to eighty(80) hours at straight time. Paragraph Two addresses the use of part-timeemployes. Section 15 contains three paragraphs. Paragraph One addresses the payment of overtime for working more than forty hours in a week. Paragraph Twodefines the work week. Paragraph Three provides a shift differential oftwenty-five cents per hour for mechanics. Work Rule 3.22 sets forth a procedure by which Bus Drivers are limited to working no more than 12.5 hours in a calendar day. Work Rule 3.22 alsoaddresses the use of Relief Drivers to ensure that a Bus Driver does not workmore than 12.5 hours in a calendar day. Neither Section 14, nor Section 15,addresses these issues. Thus, Work Rule 3.22, on its face, is not inconsistentwith Section 14 or Section 15. 4/ Nor does the record establish that the Cityhas applied Work Rule 3.22 in a manner which is inconsistent with Section 14 orSection 15. Section 6, Management Rights, relied upon by the City, reserves management of the Municipal Transit Utility and the direction of the work force to the City, except as otherwise provided in the labor contract. Given thefact that the parties' contract language is silent with respect to the issuesaddressed by Work Rule 3.22, the establishment of Work Rule 3.22 is consistentwith rights reserved to the City by Section 6. Section 22 also provides that "The City agrees that all work rules shall be applied equally." To be sure, Work Rule 3.22 provides that a Bus Driver maybe relieved and, thus, precluded from working 12.5 hours, as necessary toensure that the Relief Driver works a minimum of two hours. Inasmuch as thecircumstance limiting the Bus Driver to less than 12.5 hours is applicable toall Bus Drivers, the Work Rule does not violate the contractual mandate that"all work rules shall be applied equally." Nor does the record otherwisedemonstrate that Work Rule 3.22 has not been applied "equally." The Union argues that Work Rule 3.22 violates seniority rights to overtime guaranteed by other Work Rules. It is not evident, however, that thecontract contains any language which requires the City to continue existingwork rules. In the absence of such language, the undersigned is persuaded thatthe City's Section 22 right to adopt reasonable rules and regulations includesthe right to modify existing rules and regulations. By enacting Work Rule 3.22, the City has effectively modified any work rule which conflicts with Work Rule 3.22. Despite the Union's arguments to thecontrary, Work Rule 3.22 is entitled to be given precedence over anyconflicting work rule. Transit Manager Carlson testified that the decision to restrict the number of hours worked by a Bus Driver was motivated by a desire to protect thesafety of the Bus Driver and the public. While the Union argues that thesafety concern expressed by Carlson is pretextual, the record demonstrates 4/ Apparently, the Union is concerned that the City will use Relief Drivers in a manner which contravenes restrictions on the use of part-timeemployes contained in Section 14, Paragraph Two. Work Rule 3.22, on itsface, does not contravene this provision of the contract.

--- Page 12 ---
-1 3-otherwise. 5/ To be sure, the City's evidence does not establish that any Bus Driver was injured as a result of working more than 12.5 hours in a calendar day. Nordoes the City's evidence establish that any Bus Driver's ability to performassigned duties was impaired by working more than 12.5 hours in a calendar day. The City, however, is not required to present such evidence. Common sense persuades the undersigned that there is a legitimate safety interest which is served by not permitting Bus Drivers to work an unlimitednumber of hours. Neither Section 22, nor any other contract language reliedupon by the Union, requires the City to implement the least restrictive workrule. As discussed supra, Section 22 only requires that Work Rule 3.22 be reasonable. It is not unreasonable, per se , for the City to conclude that Bus Driver safety and public safety is served by limiting the Bus Driver work dayto 12.5 hours. 6/ The grievance challenging Work Rule 3.22 requests (1) that the City not implement the work rule and (2) that the City negotiate with the Union asrequired by law. As discussed supra, the Union had the opportunity to negotiate with the City on its decision to implement Work Rule 3.22 when theparties negotiated their 1994-95 agreement. Neither Section 22, nor any othercontract provision, requires the City to negotiate work rules during the termof the parties' 1994-95 agreement. In summary, Work Rule 3.22 is not unreasonable per se . It is not evident that Work Rule 3.22 has been applied "unequally." Nor is it evident that Work Rule 3.22 violates any provision of the parties' agreement or any binding pastpractice. The City's implementation of Work Rule 3.22 is consistent with themanagement rights reserved to the City by Section 6, as well as with the City'sSection 22 right to adopt "reasonable rules and regulations." Based upon the above and foregoing, the undersigned issues the following 5/ Transit Manager Carlson has acknowledged that a desire to save costs was a factor in his decision to provide Relief Drivers with a minimum of twohours work. The City has a legitimate interest in saving costs. 6/ As the Union argues, Transit Manager Carlson's testimony concerning the length of work day for Bus Drivers in other municipalities is hearsay.Accordingly, it has not been credited.AWARD The City did not violate the collective bargaining agreement when it implemented Sec. 3.22 of the Municipal Transit Utility Employee's Manual. The grievance is denied and dismissed. Dated at Madison, Wisconsin, this 4th day of October, 1994. By Coleen A. Burns /s/ Coleen A. Burns, Arbitrator
