7733 Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 34 / Wednesday, February 20, 2002 / Notices service of Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Unit 3. Each year TVA provides updated projections of supply and demand to theTVA sub-region of the SoutheasternElectric Reliability Council (SERC) for the U.S. Department of Energy ’s annual report EIA –411. The 1999 projection (latest available) shows expectedbaseload demands growing at 2.2percent from 1999 to 2004. The netcapacity needed to meet the growth indemand is expected to increase by 3,400megawatts by year 2003. (See line item13 on Table —Item 2.1 Projected Capacity and Demand —Summer of the EIA–411 report.) The addition of the 100 MW Pickwick Power plant is needed byTVA to meet this projected regionalpower demand for baseload capacity. Because Energy Vision 2020 identified and evaluated alternative supply-sideand demand-side energy resources andtechnologies for meeting peak andbaseload capacity needs, thesealternatives would not be re-evaluatedin this EIS. Market power purchases wasone supply-side option identified in theEIS as necessary for meeting TVA ’s baseload and peaking capacity needs. Proposed Issues To Be Addressed TVA contemplates that the EIS would describe the existing environmental andsocioeconomic resources affected bytransportation of the barges to the site,construction of the balance-of-plantcomponents on site, and operation ofthe power plant. TVA ’s evaluation of environmental impacts to theseresources would include, but notnecessarily be limited to, the potentialimpacts on air quality, water quality,aquatic and terrestrial ecology,endangered and threatened species,wetlands, floodplains, aesthetics andvisual resources, noise, land use,historic and archaeological resources,and socioeconomic resources. Alternatives At this time, the alternatives TVA has identified for detailed evaluationinclude no action and the proposedplant at the Hardin County site. Duringthe scoping process, TVA willinvestigate the feasibility of otheralternatives, including technologies andsites, which meet PPLLC ’s purposes and needs and the basic requirements ofTVA ’s electricity needs, are reasonably capable of being connected to TVA ’s transmission system, and otherwise fallwithin the reasonable range ofalternatives to be evaluated in an EIS. Scoping Process Scoping, which is integral to the NEPA process, is a procedure thatsolicits public input to the EIS process to ensure that: (1) Issues are identifiedearly and properly studied; (2) issues oflittle significance do not consumesubstantial time and effort; (3) the draftEIS is thorough and balanced; and (4)delays caused by an inadequate EIS areavoided. TVA ’s NEPA procedures require that the scoping processcommence soon after a decision hasbeen reached to prepare an EIS in orderto provide an early and open process fordetermining the scope and foridentifying the significant issues relatedto a proposed action. The scope ofalternatives and issues to be addressedin the draft EIS will be determined, inpart, from written comments submittedby mail or e-mail, and commentspresented orally or in writing at publicmeetings. The preliminary identificationin this notice of reasonable alternativesand environmental issues is not meantto be exhaustive or final. The scoping process will include both interagency and public scoping. Thepublic is invited to submit writtencomments or e-mail comments on thescope of this EIS no later than the dategiven under the DATES section of this notice. TVA will conduct a public scoping meeting at the Pickwick Landing StatePark Inn and Conference Center onMarch 5, 2002. At the meeting, TVAmanagement and project staff willpresent overviews of the EIS process,PPLLC staff will present an overview ofthe proposed power plant project, andTVA will answer questions and solicitcomments on the issues that the publicwould like addressed in the EIS. Thismeeting will be publicized throughnotices in local newspapers, TVA pressreleases, information on TVA ’s Web site at http://www.tva.gov/environment/ reports, and meetings between TVA officials and local elected officialspreceding the public meeting. The federal agencies identified at this time for inclusion in the interagencyscoping are the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers (which has agreed to be aCooperating Agency in preparation ofthe EIS), and the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService. State agencies include theTennessee Department of Economic andCommunity Development, TennesseeDepartment of Environment and Conservation, Tennessee WildlifeResources Agency, and the TennesseeState Historic Preservation Officer.Regional and local agencies include theSouthwest Tennessee DevelopmentDistrict, Hardin County government,and the Hardin County Historian. Indiantribes include the Eastern Band of theCherokee Indians, the UnitedKeetoowah Band of the Cherokee Indians, the Cherokee Nation ofOklahoma, the Chickasaw Nation, theMuscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma,the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, theKialegee Tribal Town, the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, theThlopthlocco Tribal Town, and theAlabama-Coushatta Tribe. Otheragencies, as appropriate and identified,will also be included. After consideration of the scoping comments, TVA will establishalternatives and environmental issues tobe addressed in the EIS. Followinganalysis of the environmentalconsequences of each alternative, TVAwill prepare a draft EIS for publicreview and comment. Notice ofavailability of the draft EIS will bepublished by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency in the Federal Register . Copies will be sent to public libraries, those requesting a copy,governmental agencies, and IndianTribes, and a copy will be placed onTVA ’s Web site at http://www.tva.gov/ environment/reports. TVA will solicit written comments on the draft EIS, andinformation about public meetings tocomment on the draft EIS will beannounced. TVA expects to release adraft EIS by October 2002 and a finalEIS by January 2003. Dated: February 11, 2002. Kathryn J. Jackson,Executive Vice President, River System Operations & Environment.
