Plant Location BMP is located in the Bull Mountains a pproxim ately 16 m iles southeast of Roundup, Montana, and approxim ately 35 m iles northeast of Billings, Montana. The legal description of the site is Section 12, West ½ Section 13, and Section 14, Township 6 North, Range 26 East, in Musselshell Count y, Montana. B. Current Permit Action On Novem ber 21, 2006, the De partment of Environmental Quality (Depart ment) received a request fro m BMP for a modification to Perm it #317 9-01 t o add, during t he dev elopment phase of the mining operation, a run-of-mine (ROM) coal stockpile, a topsoil stockpile, additional ha ul roads, and associat ed transfers involved with the coal stockpile and topsoil stockpile. The request will allow BMP to tran sfer coa l from the mine portal to a ROM coal stockpile using haul trucks, a wheeled loader, and a bulldozer. Coal will be dum ped to the ground from the m ine portal. A wheeled loader w ill load the haul tr ucks for transport to t he ROM coal stockpile. The haul trucks will dum p the coal to the gr ound and a bul ldozer will move the coal to the desired location wit hin the pile. Prior to stockpiling t he coal, a bulldozer will prepare the coal stockpile site by removing the t opsoi l (about 1 2 inches of soil depth) and m ove the soil into a pile for storage. BMP propose d the followi ng equi pment and em ission sources as listed below: • ROM coal st ockpile (surface area: 520,000 square feet, (ft2)) • ROM coal st ockpile site prepar ation (topsoil rem oval – dozer) • Topsoil stora ge pile (surface area: 100,000 ft2) • Mobile sourc es (haul trucks, wheeled loader, and bulldozer) BMP will add to the ROM coal stockpile until the primary phase of the m ining operation begins. After the prim ary phase of the mining operation has begun, BMP will transfer the coal fro m the coal stockpile to the new coal preparation plant. BM P is not reque sting an increase in the production rate of the developm ent phase. Once th e primary phase has begun, t he haul trucks, wheeled loader, and th e reque sted haul road operations will not be needed. 3179- 02 1 Final: 03/13/07

Perm it Analy sis BMP Investments Incorporated Perm it #3179 -02 I. Introduction/ Process Description A. Perm itted Equipm ent BMP Investments Incorporated (BMP) operates an undergrou nd coal mining op eration in the Bull Mou ntains near Round up, M ontana and appr oxim ately 35 miles north o f Billings, Montana. The facilit y contains reject piles, cl ean coal piles, an old coal preparation pl ant, a new coal preparation plant, a rail l oadout, a waste disposal area (WDA), mine ventilation, mine y ard area equi pment, a quarry, a run-of-m ine (ROM) coal stockpile, a to psoil storage pile, and va rious conve yors and transfer stations. B. Source Descr iption BMP operates an underground coal m ine that is initially capable of produci ng up to 1. 3 million tons of raw coal per year. The initial phase of this project covers the developm ent stage of the operation. The initial development phase allows for some production w hile the ultimate prim ary facilities are constructed. T he prim ary facilities (new coal wash plant and on-site rail loadout) will support a produc tion rate of up to 4.0 million tons of raw coal per year. The operations at the facility can be classifie d into four categories: underground mining, coal handling and storage, coal cleaning, and waste disposal. Coal will be m ined undergro und using conti nuous m iner sections and l ongwall pa nels. The continu ous miner will be used to establish a mineable block of coal, and the longwall equipm ent will be used to extract the block of coal. A convey or belt will be used to transfer the ROM coal to a stockpile outside of the mine portal. Surface mater ial storage facilities will include stockpiles of ROM coal, clean coal, and reject material from the wash plant. Mat erial will be m oved fro m inside the m ine to the ROM stockpile on a high capacity belt c onve yor. Other conveyors will be used to transport coal from the ROM pile to the coal cleaning facility and fr om there to the clean coal piles. Coal will be supplied to local c onsum ers from bins with hoppers located at the wash plant facilities. Reject material wi ll be sent to t he WDA. During the de velopm ent operations, the coal will be transferred fro m the ROM stockpile to the existing wash plant via a belt conveyor . The c oal will pass through the buffer bin to a crusher and sizing screen and then o n to the heavy m edia wash er. The final product will be passed through a fl uidized bed t o air dr y the product. A pri mary coal washing facility will be constructed concurrent ly with the developm ent operations. The development phase wash plant will reject 19 percent of the raw coal stream and the new primary facility will reject 13 percent of the raw coal stream. These coal processing wastes and other mine development wastes w ill be perm anently disposed of in the WDA located 1.4 miles northeast of the wash plant. The m ine plan calls for revegetation of this area aft er completion of the project and af ter the appropriate seed bed preparation. 3179- 02 1 Final: 03/13/07

C. Perm it History Perm it #3179-00 was issued to BMP on May 10, 2002, for the project as descr ibed above located in Sections 1 2, 13, and 1 4, Township 6 North, Range 26 East, in Musselshell Count y, Montana. On May 9, 2003, BMP submitted a request to delay the commencement of am bient air monitoring until the m ine reaches a coal prod uction level of 1.3 m illion tons during any rolling 12-m onth perio d. The perm it action was an administrative amend ment to make that change and to update t he rule citations in the per mit. Perm it #317 9-01 replaced Perm it #3179 -00. D. Current Permit Action On Novem ber 21, 2006, the De partment of Environmental Quality (Depart ment) received a request from BMP for a m odification to Perm it #3179-01 to add , during the developm ent phase of the mining operation, a ROM coal stockpile, a topsoil stoc kpile, additional ha ul roads, and associat ed transfers involved with the coal stockpile and topsoil stockpile. The request will allow BMP to transfer coal from the mine portal to a ROM coal st ockpile using haul trucks, a wheel ed loader, and a bul ldozer. Coal will be dumped to the ground from the mine portal. A wheeled loader will load the ha ul trucks for transport t o the ROM coal stockpile. The haul truc ks will dum p the coal to the groun d and a bulldozer will move the coal to th e desired location wit hin the pile. Prior to stockpiling t he coal, a bulldozer will prepare the coal stockpile site by removing the topsoil (abo ut 12 inches of soil depth) an d move the soil into a pi le for storage. BMP propose d the followi ng equi pment and em ission sources as listed below: • ROM coal st ockpile (surface area: 520,000 square feet, (ft2)) • ROM coal st ockpile site prepar ation (topsoil rem oval – dozer) • Topsoil stora ge pile (surface area: 100,000 ft2) • Mobile sourc es (haul trucks, wheeled loader, and bulldozer) BMP will add to the ROM coal stockpile until the primary phase of the m ining operation begins. After the prim ary phase of the mining operation has begun, BMP will transfer the coal from the coal stockpile to the ne w co al preparation plant. BMP is not r equesting an increase in the production rate of the de velopment phase.

C. ARM 17.8, S ubchapter 3 – Emission Standards, inclu ding, but not limited to: ARM 17.8.3 04 Visible Air Contam inants . This rule requires that no person m ay cause or authorize em issions to be disch arged into the outd oor atmosphere from any source installed after Novem ber 23, 19 68, that exhi bit an opacit y of 20% or greater averaged over six consecutive m inutes. ARM 17.8.3 08 Particulate Matter, Airborne . (1) This rule requires an opacity limitation of 20% for all fugitive em ission sources and that reasonable precautions be taken to contr ol emissions of airborne P articulate Mat ter (PM). (2) Under this rule, BMP shall not cause or authorize the use of any street, road or parki ng lot wit hout taking reasonable precauti ons to control e missions of airborne particulate matter. ARM 17.8.3 09 Particulate Matter, Fuel Burning E quipment . This rule requires that no person sha ll cause, allow or perm it to be discharg ed into t he atm osphere particulate matter caused by the com bustion of f uel in excess of the am ount determ ined by this rule. ARM 17.8.310 Particulate Matter, Industrial Process . This rule requires that no person shall cause, allow or perm it to be di scharged into the atm osphere particula te matter in excess of the amount set forth in this rule. ARM 17.8.3 22 Sulfur Oxi de Em issions--Sulfur in F uel. This rule requires that no person shall burn liquid, solid or gaseous fuel in excess of the am ount set forth in this rule. ARM 17.8.340 Standard of Perfor mance for New Stat ionary Sources and Em ission Guidelines for Existing S ources . This rule incorporat es, by referen ce, 40 CFR 60, Standards of Perform ance for New Stati onary Source s (NSPS). BMP is considered an NSPS affected facility under 40 CFR 60 and is subj ect to the requirem ents of 40 CFR 60, Subpart Y, Standard of Perfo rmance for Co al Preparation Plants. Subpart Y - C oal Preparation Plants - requires a particulate em ission lim itation of 04 grams per dry standard cubic m eter, a 10 percent opacity lim itation on pneum atic coal cleaning e missions, and an opacity limitation of 20 percent for coal processing, conve ying, storage, and loading system s as described i n Section II of the perm it. The subpart also requires partic ulate and opacity lim itations for thermal dryers. The coal dry er proposed for th e developm ent phase of the operation uses ambient air as opposed to a heated gas stream ; therefore, that porti on of t he regulation is not applicable. If at so me point, the permittee proposes to use a heated gas strea m for coal dry ing, the Depart ment must be n otified in or der to determ ine the monitoring and testing requirem ents wit h respect to NSPS applicability. The NS PS applicability f or pneum atic coal cleaning and thermal dry ers is specific to bitum inous coal, while the other provis ions appl y to all clas sificati ons of coal. The applicant reported that the coal to be m ined is classified as bituminous. D. ARM 17.8, S ubchapter 5 – Air Quality Perm it Application, Operation and Ope n Burning Fees, including, but not limited to: ARM 17.8.504 Air Quality Perm it Application Fees . This section requires that an applicant submit an air qualit y perm it applica tion fee concurrent with the subm ittal of an air qualit y perm it application. A per mit application is incom plete until the pr oper application fee is paid to the Depart ment. BMP subm itted the appro priate perm it application fee for the current perm it action. 3179- 02 4 Final: 03/13/07

ARM 17.8.5 05 When Permit Required--Exclusions . An annual air qualit y operation fee must, as a condition of continued opera tion, be subm itted to the Depart ment by each source o f air conta minants holding an air quality per mit (excl uding an ope n burnin g permit) issued b y the Department. The air q uality operati on fee is based on the actual or estimated actual am ount of air pollutants emitted during the previ ous calendar y ear. An air qualit y operation fee is separate and distinct fr om an air qualit y perm it application fee. The annua l assessment and collection of the air qualit y operati on fee, described above, shall take place on a cal endar-y ear ba sis. The Depart ment may insert into any final perm it issued after the effective date of these r ules, such conditions as may be necessary to require th e pay ment of an air qua lity operation fee on a calendar-y ear basis, in cluding provi sions that pro rate the required fee am ount. E. ARM 17.8, S ubchapter 7 – Perm it, Constr uction and Operation of Air Contam inant Sources, including, but not lim ited to: ARM 17.8.7 40 Definitions . This rule is a list of appli cable definitions used in t his chapter, unless indicated otherwise in a s pecific subchapter. ARM 17.8.743 Montana Ai r Quality Permits--When Required . This rule requires a facility to obt ain an air qualit y perm it or perm it alterat ion if the y construct, alter or use any air contam inant sources that have th e Potential to Em it (PTE) greater than 25 tons per year of any polluta nt. BMP has the PTE m ore than 25 tons per y ear of particulate matter with an aerodynam ic diam eter of 10 m icrons or less (PM 10); therefore, an air qualit y permit is required. ARM 17.8.744 Montana Ai r Quality Permits--General Exclusions . This rule identifies the activities that are not subj ect to the Montana Air Qual ity Perm it program . ARM 17.8.745 Montana Ai r Quality Permits—Exclusion for De Mi nimis Changes . This rule identifies the de mini mis chan ges at perm itted facilities t hat are not subject to the Montana Air Quality Perm it Program . ARM 17.8.748 New or Modified Em itting Units--Permit Application Requirements . (1) This rule r equires that a perm it appli cation be submitted prior t o installation, modification, or use of a source. BMP subm itted the required permit application for the current perm it action. (7) This rule r equires that the applicant notif y the public by means of lega l publication in a newspape r of general circulation in the area aff ected by the applic ation for a pe rmit. BMP subm itted an affidavit of publication of public notice for the Novem ber 19, 200 6, issue of The Billings Gazette , a newspaper of general circulation in t he city of Billin gs in Yellowstone Count y, as proof of compliance with the public notice requirements. ARM 17.8.7 49 Conditi ons for Issuance or Denial of Perm it. This rule requires that the perm its issued by the D epartment must authorize the construction and operation of the facility or em itting unit subject to the conditions in the perm it and the requirem ents of this subcha pter. This rul e also requires that the permit must contain any conditions neces sary to assure co mpliance with the Federal Cle an Air Act (FCAA), the Clean Air Ac t of Montana, and rules adopted under those acts. 3179- 02 5 Final: 03/13/07

ARM 17.8.7 52 Emission Control Requir ements. This rule requires a source to install the maxi mum air polluti on control capabilit y that is te chnically practicable and econom ically feasible, except that BACT shall be util ized. A BACT review was required for the current permit action. The BACT analy sis is discus sed in Section III of this Perm it Analy sis. ARM 17.8.7 55 Inspection of Perm it. This rule requi res that air quality perm its shall be made avail able for inspection by the Department at the location of the source. ARM 17.8.7 56 Com pliance with Other Requirem ents. This rule states that nothing in the perm it shall be construed as relieving BMP of the responsibilit y for com plying with an y appl icable federal or Montan a statute, rule, or standard, except as specifically provided i n ARM 17.8. 740, et seq . ARM 17.8.7 59 Review of Applications . This rule de scribes the Depart ment’s responsibiliti es for processing perm it applications and making permit decisions on those perm it applications that do n ot require the preparation of an e nvironm ental impact stat ement. ARM 17.8.7 62 Duration of Perm it. An air qualit y permit sh all be valid until revoked or modified, as provided i n this subcha pter, except that a perm it issued prior to construction of a new or altered source may contain a condition providin g that t he permit will expire unless construction is comme nced within the time specified in the permit, which in no event may be less th an 1 year after the per mit is issued. ARM 17.8.7 63 Revocation of Perm it. An air qualit y permit may be revoked up on written request of the permittee, or for vi olations of any requirement of the Clean Air Act of Montana, rules adop ted under the Clean Air Act of Montana, the FCAA, rules adopted u nder the FCAA, or an y applic able requirement contained in the Mo ntana State I mplementation Plan (SIP). ARM 17.8.7 64 Adm inistrative Am endment to Perm it. An air qualit y perm it may be amended for changes in any applicable rul es and standards adopted by the Board of Environm ental Review (Board) or chan ged conditi ons of operation at a source or stack that do not result in a n increase of e missions as a result of those changed conditions. The owner or operator of a facility may not increase the facility’ s emissions beyond perm it limits unless t he increase meets the criter ia in ARM 8.745 for a de minimis change not re quiring a permit, or unless the owner or operator applies for and receives another permit in acc ordance with ARM 17.8.748, ARM 17.8.7 49, ARM 17.8 .752, ARM 1 7.8.755, and A RM 17.8. 756, and with all applicable requirements in ARM Title 17, Chapter 8, subchapters 8, 9, and 10. ARM 17.8.7 65 Transfer of Perm it. This rule states that an air qualit y perm it may be transferred from one perso n to anot her if written noti ce of Intent to Transfer, including the names of the transferor and the transfere e, is sent to the Depart ment . F. ARM 17.8, S ubchapter 8 – Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality, including, but not lim ited to: ARM 17.8.8 01 Definitions .

ARM 17.8.818 Review of Major Statio nary Sources a nd Major Modifications-- Source Appli cability and E xemptions . The requirem ents contained in ARM 17.8. 819 throug h 17.8.827 shall app ly to an y major stationar y source and any m ajor modific ation, with respect to each pollutant subject to regulation under the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) that it would emit, except as this subchapter would ot herwise allow. This facility is not a m ajor stationary source since this facility is not a listed source and the facility 's PTE is below 250 t ons per year of any pollutant (excl uding fugiti ve emissions). As part of previous perm it application processe s, the Depart ment required BMP to provide i nformation regarding the owne rship relationship between the BMP Bull Mountain Mi ne #1 Project and the pro posed Roundu p Power Project. BMP indicated that BMP is the lessee un der a co al lea se co mprising the coal to be mined at the Bull Mountain Mi ne #1 coal m ine. In additi on, BMP has applied for the perm it to mine the coal at the m ine. BMP further indicated that the Roundup Po wer Project will ultimately be owned by private, m unicipal, and cooperative utilities, and possibl y industrial companies. None of these equity owners of the Roundup Power Proj ect have any interest or ownership in BMP nor will they in the future. Curren tly Bull Mountain Development Co mpany, No. 1, L.L.C., is e ngaged in t he developm ent of the Roundup Power Project. While Bull Mountain De velopm ent Com pany, No. 1, L.L.C., is c urrentl y involved in the developm ent of the Roun dup Power Pro ject, it in tends to transfer all rights it has in the project to the ultim ate owners of the R oundup Power Project once those owners have been selected and have ent ered into appr opriate contracts am ong themselves. BMP currently has no interest or ownership in the Round up Power Project and it is n ot anticipated that BMP will, at any time, have any ownership interests or right to control the ultim ate entit y that will com plete de velopm ent of the Roundup Power Project and thereafter ope rate such project. BMP does have a contractual agreement with Bull M ountain Developm ent Co mpan y, No. 1, L.L.C. , to sup ply coal and for ulti mate ash disposal for the Round up plant. This contract will be transferred from Bull M ountain Developm ent Co mpany , No. 1, L.L.C., to the plant owners upon com pletion of the owner’s agreem ents. Therefore, for the purpose of air perm itting, the Depart ment currently considers the Bull Mountain Mi ne #1 and the Round up Po wer Project to be separate and distinct st ationary sources as de fined under New Source Re view. G. ARM 17.8, S ubchapter 12 – Operating P ermit Program Applicability, including, but not limited to: ARM 17.8.1201 Definitions . (23) Major Source under Section 741 2 of the FCAA is defined as any source havi ng: a. PTE > 100 t ons/year of any poll utant; b. PTE > 10 tons/y ear of any one Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP), PTE > 25 tons/y ear of a com bination of all HAPs, or lesser quantity as the Depart ment may establish by rule; or c. PTE > 70 tons/y ear of PM 10 in a serious PM 10 nonattainment area. 3179- 02 7 Final: 03/13/07

ARM 17.8.1204 Air Quality Operating P ermit Program . (1) Title V of the FCAA amendments of 1990 requires that all sources, as defi ned in ARM 17.8.1204(1), obtain a Title V Operating Perm it. In reviewing and i ssuing Air Qualit y Perm it #317 9-02 f or BMP, the foll owing conclu sions were made: a. The facility’ s PTE is less than 100 t ons/y ear for any pollutant (excluding fugitive em issions). b. The facility’ s PTE is less than 10 tons/y ear for any one HAP and less than 25 tons/y ear of all HAPs. c. This source is not located in a serious PM 10 nonattainment area. d. This facility is subject to 40 CFR 60, S ubpart Y. e. This facility is not subject t o any current NESHAP st andards. f. This source is not a Title I V affect ed source, nor a solid waste co mbustion unit. g. This source is not an EPA designated Title V source. Based on these facts, the Depart ment det ermined that BMP will be a minor source of emissions as defined under Title V and BMP is not r equired to obt ain a Title V Operating Permit. However, if m inor sour ces subject to NSPS are required to obtain a Title V Operating Perm it in the future, BMP will be required to obtain a Title V Operating Permit. III. BACT Determination A BACT dete rmination is required for each new or altered source. BMP shall install on the ne w or altered source the maximum air pollution cont rol capability , which is technically practicable and econom ically feasible, except that BACT sh all be utilized. The current per mit action modifies Permit #3179- 01 by allowing a ROM coal stockpile to operate during t he developm ent phase of the mining operation and also a dds an emission source to the facility (topsoil storage pile); therefore, a BACT an alysis was re quired for the current permit action. The Depart ment determ ined that BACT for th e ROM coal stockpile, a topsoil storage pile, transfer points, coal handli ng, to psoil ha ndling , and vehicle traffic on unpaved r oads is the continuatio n of em ission control techni ques currently used at the m ine. This includes che mical stabilization and watering on haul roads a nd good engi neering practices such as minim izing fall distances on materi al handling operations as nece ssary to m aintain co mpliance w ith the opacity and reasonable precautions lim itations. The following poll utants will be em itted as a result of the project: Pollutant Source Particulates ( PM/PM 10): Fugitive em issions from mining activitie s, conve ying, handling, and loadout of co al; handling , conve ying, and disp osal of reject/waste material; handling of topsoil and to psoil storage pile; and travel on unpaved road s. 3179- 02 8 Final: 03/13/07

--- Page 18 ---
PM/PM 10 BACT Analy sis Units with applicable em issions for this BACT an alysis include fugitive em issions of particul ates from a ROM coal stockpile, a topsoil storage pile, tr ansfer points, coal handlin g, topsoil han dling, and vehicle traffic on unpa ved roads. Fugitive PM/ PM10 Emissions In general, fugitive em issions from open sources ar e controlled by preventative and/or m itigating measures/techniques. The sources of fugitive pa rticulates may be classified acco rding to the activities, wh ich generate the e missions. The ac tivity class es for the proposed project include: 1) wind erosion of coal stockpile, 2) coal h andling and transfer, 3) wind erosion of topsoil storage pile, 4) to psoil handlin g, an d 5) travel on unpaved r oads. Wind erosion affects both the storage piles and out door material handling/ disposal activities. Preventative techniques reduce em issions b y reducin g the extent of t he source, b y modify ing the process, or by adjusting work practices. Reducti on of emissions of fugitive dust or particulate matter fro m wind erosion and m aterial handling can be acco mplished by enclos ure, che mical stabilization, or material wetting. Chemical stabilizati on will not be considered because it has been deem ed technically unfeasible for the propo sed project due to the constant activity on the storage piles and because the che micals used could be come air pollutants as the coal is burned. A significant concern with this operation is the potenti al for wind erosion from the ROM and clean coal sto ckpiles. Enclosure of the stockpil es (in barns or silos) was conside red through the BACT analy sis but was not deter mined to be t echnically feasible due to the constant materi al movement at the source and this ty pe of control has not been required for recently perm itted similar sources of particulate emissions. The Department will req uire that BMP appl y surfa ce moisture to the product either during m ining activiti es, washing, or l oadout operations and util ize contourin g techniques to r educe potential for wind erosion. The Depart ment deter mined that the use of reasonable precautions, contouring, a nd watering, as necessary , to maintain co mplian ce with the 20% opacity lim itation will constitute BACT for the coal stockpiles. The Depart ment deter mined that the use of reasonable precautions, contour ing, w atering and/or chem ical dust suppressant, co mpaction techniques, and re-vegetation, as necessar y, to m aintain compliance with the 20% opacity limitation will c onsti tute BACT for the topsoil s torage pile. Material handling for the purposes of this BACT analysis is broken down into tw o categories, coal product and topsoil product. Coal handling activities include drops to and from the front-end loader, haul tr ucks, and gro und. Coal handling also in cludes movement of the pi le by a bull dozer. Topsoil han dling occurs b y moving the topsoil int o a storage pile by a bulld ozer. The Depart ment deter mined that BMP shall m inimize the fall distance associ ated with all materi al handling activities to the greatest extent th at is practically feasible. Further, BMP shall develop, im plement, and maintain good housekeepin g practices to keep coal and topsoil transfer locations clea n. For particulates generated during loado ut operations onto stockpiles , the Depart ment determ ined that the use of fixed stackers with an undergroun d reclai m system at the permanent facility and a radial stacker with an adjus table chute at the development facility constitutes BACT. 3179- 02 9 Final: 03/13/07

--- Page 19 ---
In addition, B MP shall utili ze wat er and/or ch emical d ust suppressant, as necessary , for the purpose of controlling em issions from the movement of m aterials by bulldozer or front-end loader. Also, BMP shall use wat ering and/or chem ical dust suppre ssants, contouring techni ques, and eventually soil covering and re-vegetati on for con trolling particulate em issions from the topsoil storag e pile. Further, BMP m ust take reasonable precautions to limit the fugiti ve em issions of airborne particulate matter on haul r oads. BMP shall clean up all spilled material fro m roadway s to fur ther limit potential fugitive em issions. The Depart ment determ ined that the use water spray and/or chem ical dust suppressant, as necessary , to m aintain com pliance wi th the opacit y and reasonable precautions limitations will constitute BACT for the haul roads. In summary , the Depart ment determ ined that good housekeeping pr actices, minimization of fall distance for material transfer operations, the application of m oisture throug hout the m ining process, using stackers wit h a reclai m system for the pri mary phase of operations and a radial stacker with a n adjustable chute for the devel opment phase for pile form ing, enclosures for all surface conveyors and conveyor transfer points i ncorporating fabric filter baghouses or pick-up points, and water spray and/or chem ical dust s uppres sant, as necessary , to maintain com pliance with perm itted opacity requirem ents an d reas onable precautions limitations constitutes BAC T for these sources. IV. Emission Inventor y Table 1 lists the esti mated PM 10 emissions for the primary phase of the project, including emission control practices and equipm ent to be used. Peak and annual e missions on both an uncontrolled and a controlled basis are i ncluded. Peak em ission ra tes are bas ed on peak productio n rates or hours o f equipm ent operation. Peak coal prod uction thr ough the preparation plant has been proposed at 25,000 t ons per day. The annual em ission rates are based on average productio n rates and annual operating h ours. The an nual coal prod uction rate has been propos ed at 4 m illion tons. The ori ginal perm it application also contains a com plete emissi on inventor y for the development phase operations. Peak and annua l coal production rates for the developm ent phase have been proposed at 4,000 tons per da y and 1.3 m illion tons per y ear, respectively .

V. Existing Air Quality Baseline air q uality (particulate) was monitored in the project area . The m easurements included both TSP (total suspended particulate) and PM 10. The period of record subm itted with the application is from March 1989 through March 1992. All values are well below applicable ambient ai r quali ty standards. The following table summarize s the data. (Values are report ed in m icrogr ams per cubic meter.) Year Parameter 24-Hour High Reading 24-Hour Second High est Annual Average No. of Samples 1989 TSP PM-10 39 53* 33 19 14 9 51 51 1990 TSP PM-10 59 29 58 27 13 9 59 57 1991 TSP PM-10 42 24 39 21 14 9 56 57 *This high P M-10 value was recorded on June 27; no TSP value was recorded on that date. The state and federal PM-10 standards are as follows: Annual Average = 50 µg/m3 24-ho ur = 150 µg/m3 Meteorological data was collected at the site as well. The predominant wind di rection is from the northwest. In the immediat e plant area t he predom inant wind is up the P.M. dra w. There is also a significant southeasterly component down the draw. Current local sources of air polluti on in the area include vehicle traffic (unpaved roads), the PM Mine, agricultural activities, and hom e heating. Operational air m onitoring requirem ents for t he project are contained in Att achment 1. VI. Ambient Air Impact Analy sis Project Summary The current per mit action is to add, during th e development phase of the m ining operation, a ROM coal st ockpile, a topsoil stockpile, additiona l haul roads, and associat ed transfers involved with the coal stockpile and topsoil stockpile. The m ine pro ject will include two phases: the de velopment phase and the prim ary phase. During the development phase of the operation, BMP propose s to initiall y mine at a rate of 1.3 m illion tons of raw coal per year. The initial de velopm ent phase will allow for som e production while the prim ary phase facilities are constructed. Th ese primary facilities include a new coal wash plant and an onsite rail loadout, which will support production of up to 4 million tons of coal per year. 3179- 02 13 Final: 03/13/07

Review of Modeling Anal ysis Air dispersion m odeling was not required for the curr ent perm itting action. However, GeoResearch Inc. performed an air qualit y impact analysis for t his project for the initial application subm itted by Meridian Minerals Company on Januar y 16, 1991, and GeoResearch performed a second analy sis for the Add endum dated February 25, 1992 , that was subm itted to the Department on March 5, 19 92. The analy sis used the EPA Industrial Source Co mplex Model (ISCST and ISCLT) to estimate the i mpacts of the particulates, N OX, SO 2, and CO. The analy sis included both the development phase a nd the prim ary phase, which originally included the ROM coal stockpile. The 1992 re sults showed that pred icted am bient i mpacts for this facility woul d not cause or contribute to a vi olation of an y state or federal air qualit y standard. VII. Taking or Da maging Im plication Analy sis As required by 2-10- 105, MCA, the Departm ent conducted a priv ate property t aking and damaging assessment and determ ined there are no taking or damaging im plications. VIII. Environm ental Assessmen t An environm ental assessment, required by the Montana Environmental Policy Act, was completed for this project. A copy is attached. 3179- 02 14 Final: 03/13/07

DEPARTME NT OF ENVI RONMENT AL QUALIT Y Perm itting and Com pliance Division Air Resources Management Bureau P.O. Box 20 0901, Helena, Montana 59 620 (406) 4 44-3490 FINAL E NVIRONMEN TAL ASSES SMENT (EA ) Issued For: BMP Inves tments Incorporated 490 North 31st Street, #308 Billings, MT 59101 Air Quality Permit Nu mber: 3179-02 Preliminary Deter mination Issued : 02/ 07/07 Department Decision Issued: 02/23/07 Permit Final: 03/1 3/07 Legal Descri ption of Site: BMP is located in the Bull Mountains a pproxim ately 16 m iles southeast of Roundup, Montana, and approxim ately 35 m iles northeast of Billings, Montana. The legal description of the site is Section 12, West ½ Sect ion 13, and Section 14, Township 6 North, Range 26 East, in Musselshell Count y, Montana. Desc ription of Project: BMP subm itted a perm it application to m odify Perm it #3179-01 to add, during the de velopm ent phase of the mining operatio n, a ROM coal stockpile, a topsoil stockpile, additional ha ul roads, and associat ed transfers involved with the coal stockpile and topsoil stockpile. Objective s of the Project: The issuance of Perm it #31 79-02 wo uld allow BMP to im plement the above mentioned project during t he deve lopment phase of the m ining operation. Alternatives Considered: In addition to the proposed action, the Depart ment also considered the "no-action" al ternative. Th e "no-action" alternative w ould deny issuance of the Montana Air Quality perm it to the facility. However, the Depart ment does not consider the "no-action" alternative to be appropriate because B MP dem onstr ated co mpliance with all applicable rules and regulations as required for permit issuan ce. Theref ore, the "no-action" alternative was eliminated from further consideration. A Listing of Mitigation, Stipulati ons, a nd Other Controls : A listing of the enforceable per mit conditions and a perm it analysis, includi ng a BA CT analy sis, woul d be containe d in Perm it #3179-02. Regulatory Ef fects on Private Property Rights : The D epartment co nsidered alter natives to the conditions imposed in this perm it as part of the perm it developm ent. The Department determ ined the perm it conditions would be reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with applicable require ments and to dem onstrate co mpliance w ith those requirements and woul d not unduly restrict private property rights. 3179- 02 15 Final: 03/13/07

Cumulative and Secondar y Impacts X yes Sum mary of Com ments o n Potential P hysical and Biological Ef fects: The following comments have been prepared by the Depart ment. A. Terr estrial and Aqua tic Life and Habitats; B. Water Quali ty, Quantity, and Distribution; C. Geology and Soil Quality, Stability, and Moisture; D. Vegetation Cover, Quantity, and Qual ity; and E. Aesthe tics Overall im pacts to the ph ysical and biological enviro nmental parameters noted above would be minor because the activities would occur within the c urrent m ining area with little or no additional surface disturba nce. Furtherm ore, the current per mit action would allow operation of a ROM coal st ockpile, during the development phase of the m ining operation, within the currently approved m ine plan area. This would re sult in a relatively small increase in air pollutant emissions above those associated with the current m ining rate. In the maxi mum em ission scenario, there would be a particulate emission in crease of less than 10 percent above the cur rent permitted level. All of the increase would be fugitive emissions. There would be a small increase in ai r pollutant deposition in the area and in the use of water for dust suppression. Overall, the de mands and im pacts to terr estrial and aquatic life and ha bitats; water qualit y, quantit y, and distribution; geol ogy and s oil qualit y, stabilit y, and m oisture; vegetation cover, quantity , and quality ; and aesthetics r elated to the increased activities would be minor. F. Air Quality The air quality im pacts from the incr eased activities would be m inor because Per mit #3179- 02 would inclu de conditions l imiting the vi sible em issions (opacit y) from the plant operations, and would require water and/or chem ical dust suppressan t and other m eans to control air polluti on. The plant ope rations would continue to be limited by Perm it #3179 -02 to total emissions of 250 tons per year or less fro m non-fugiti ve sources, including any additi onal equipm ent used at the site. This facilit y would continue to be considered a minor source of air pollut ion for the Title V program , because the facility’s potential emissions would be below 100 t ons per year. Overall, air em issions from the incr eased activities would have minor im pacts on air quality in the immediate and surrounding area because of the relatively small am ount of additional pol lutants 3179- 02 16 Final: 03/13/07

generated. Air polluti on controls currently used at the facility , such as fabric filtration, chem ical stabilization and/or water suppression, w ould re duce air em issions f rom equipm ent operations, storage piles, and haul roads. G. Unique End angered, Fragile, or Limited Environmental Re sources The increased activities wo uld occur wi thin the previously disturbe d industrial site at the mine. As part of the MEPA analysis on initial mine development, assessments of potential im pacts to unique endangered, fragile, or limited en vironm ental r esources wer e done by the Depart ment, including contact with the Montana Natural He ritage Program – Natural Resource Inform ation System (NRIS) to identif y species of special con cern at the m ine site. The likelih ood t hat the operation of t he ROM coal stockpile dur ing th e devel opment phase of the m ining operation would im pact unique endangered, fragile, or limited e nvironm ental resources wo uld be m inor because of the relatively small increa se in em issions , the lack of change to the mine plan area, and the condi tions placed in Perm it #3179-02. H. Demands on Environmen tal Resource s of Water, Air, and Energy The increased activities wo uld require minim al additional am ounts of water, air, and energy . Limited am ounts of water would be req uired to be used for dust co ntrol for t he equipm ent, product stockpiles, and sur roundi ng haul roads. Further, as describ ed in Section 7.F. of t his EA, pollutant em issions generated from the operation would have m inimal im pacts on air qualit y in the immediat e and surrounding area because of the relatively small increase in e missions, the lack of change to the m ine plan area, and the cond itions placed in Per mit #3179-02. Overall, the demands and im pacts to the environm ental resour ce of water, air, a nd energy related to the increased acti vities would be m inor. I. Historical and Archaeological Sites The increased activities wo uld occur wi thin the previously disturbe d industrial site at the mine. According to past correspondence from the Montan a State Historic Preservation Office, there i s low likelihood of adverse disturbance to any known archaeologica l or historic site because of previous industrial disturbance within the area. Therefore, the likel ihood that the increased activities would have an impact on histor ical or archaeological sites would be m inor. J. Cumulative and Secondary Impacts The increased activities from the project would cau se minor cum ulative and secondar y impacts to the phy sical and biological aspects of the hum an environm ent. There would be a relatively small increase in ai r emissions o f particulate matter and P M10 and no increas e in the mine plan are a. 3179- 02 17 Final: 03/13/07

Cumulative and Secondar y Impacts X yes SUMMAR Y OF COMM ENTS ON P OTENTIAL ECONOM IC AND S OCIAL EFFE CTS: The following comments have been prepared by the Depart ment. A. Social Structures and Mores B. Cultural Uniqueness and Diversity The Depart ment deter mined that the current perm it action woul d not have an im pact on the soci al structures and m ores or the cultural uniqueness and diversity of this area of operat ion because the operation of a ROM coal st ockpile, during the development phase of the m ining operation, is relatively minor and the activities would occur within the previously disturbed industrial area. The surround ing area would rem ain unchanged as a result of the pr oposed projec t. C. Local and St ate Tax Base and Tax Re venue The increased activities wo uld have little or no impact on the local a nd state tax base and tax revenue. No full tim e, per manent em ployees would be added as a result of issuing Perm it #3179- T he increase in the amount of equipment at the si te would be minimal. D. Agricultural or Industrial Production The increased activities wo uld occur wi thin the previously disturbe d industrial area; therefore, the Department would n ot expect an im pact to or displacem ent of agricultural prod uction. T he increased acti vities would be relatively small co mpared to the existing m ining operation and would have onl y a minor im pact on local industr ial production. In addition, the facility woul d operate within the perm itted m ining area, which upon completion of mining operations, would be reclai med, as specified, by the Environmental Ma nagement Bureau (EMB) of the Department. 3179- 02 18 Final: 03/13/07

Minor and te mporary effects may occur to agricu ltural land, and t he EMB would be responsi ble for oversight of an y reclamation activities. Th erefore, im pacts to ag ricultural or i ndustrial productio n would be m inor. E. Human H ealth Perm it #3179-02 would inc orporate conditions to ensu re that the increased activities would be accomplished in com pliance with all applicable ai r quality rules and standards. These rules and standards are designed to be protective of hum an heal th. As noted i n Section 7.F . of this EA, t he air em issions from this faci lity would be minimized by fabric filtration, water spray and/or chem ical stab ilization, and opacity lim itations. Further more, the increased activities and resulting air emissions would be relatively small. Ther efore, any associated i mpacts to human health would be m inor based as a result of compliance with the applicable standards and operational conditions and lim itations incorporated within the per mit. F. Acce ss to and Quality of Recr eational and Wilderness A ctivities The increased activities wo uld occur within the pr eviously disturbe d industrial property and would not impact access to recreational and wild erness activities. Minor im pacts on the quality of recreationa l activities could be created from the noise fro m the increas ed acti vities; however, these would be s mall in com parison to existing ac tivities. E missions from the operation would be minimized as a result of the conditions t hat would be placed in Permit #3179- 02. Therefore, the associat ed impacts on the access to and quality of recreational and wilderness activities would be minor. G. Quantity an d Distribution of Employment; and H. Distribution of Populati on As a result of the relatively sm all size of the operations associ ated with the increased activities, the quantit y and distrib ution of em ployment and the distributio n of popu lation i n the area would not be im pacted. No full time, per manent employees would be added as a result of issuing Permit #3179-02 and no related secondar y employment would be expected. Therefore, no im pacts to the distributio n of popu lation i n the area would be expect ed. I. Demands of Government Services Minor increases may be observed in the local traffi c on existing roa ds in the area. Very limited additional government ser vices would be required re lative to these operations. Overall, de mands for governm ent services would be m inor. J. Industrial and Commercial Activity The increased activities wo uld represent onl y a minor increase in the industrial activit y in the area because the operation of the ROM coal s tockpile would operate during th e development phase of the m ining operation. No additional comme rcial activi ty would result because no secondary activities are expected to m ove to the area as a result of the increased activities. Overall, only a minor increase in industrial and commercial ac tivity would be exp ected as a result of the proposed pr oject. 3179- 02 19 Final: 03/13/07

K. Locally Adopted Environmental Plans and Goals The Department is not aware of an y locally adopt ed environm ental plans or goals that would be affect ed by the proposed project. The state sta ndards would pro tect the prop osed site and the environm ent surroundi ng the site. L. Cumulative and Secondary Impacts The increased activities wo uld cause minor cum ulative and secondary im pacts to the social and econom ic aspects of the human environment in th e immedi ate area because of t he small incr ease in potential air e missions. Increas es in traffic woul d have m inor impacts on the local traffic in the immediate area. Bec ause the project would be a relatively small increas e of particulate e missions compared to the current op eration, onl y minor econo mic im pacts to the local econom y woul d be expected. Ne w businesses would not be drawn to any areas and permanent jobs would not be created or lost as a result of the proposed proj ect. Ov erall, the prop osed project would have minor im pacts to the cum ulative and secondar y impacts to the social and economic aspects of the human environment. Reco mmendation: An E nvironm ental Im pact Statement (EIS) is n ot required. If an EIS is not required, explain wh y the EA is an appropriat e level of ana lysis: All pot ential effect s resulting from the proposed increase in activities are minor; th erefore, an EIS is not required. In addition, the source would be appl ying the Best Availabl e Control Technolo gy and t he analy sis indicat es compliance with all applicable air qualit y rules and regulations.
