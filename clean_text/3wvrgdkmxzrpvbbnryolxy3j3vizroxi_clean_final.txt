FORWARD September 2005 The release of the 2004 Oregon Nursery and Greenhouse Survey results represents the fifteenth year of documenting throug h statistics the progress of Oregon’s # 1 agricultural industry. Nursery and greenhouse sales climbed to $ 844 million in 2004,up 8 percent from the previous year, demonstr ating that the industry continues to do an outstanding job of growing and marketing high quality nursery stock and materials.This growth continues despite the challe nges of truck shortages, rising fuel, transportation, and labor co sts, sometimes burdensome re gulations, and competition for land. The industry is a key generator of revenue for the State, with in excess of 75 percent of sales coming from outside Oregon. Oregon’s top five producing counties Cl ackamas, Washington, Marion, Yamhill, and Multnomah are in or near the Portland metropolitan area. The nurseries andgreenhouses in these five counties represent 86 percent of the tota l value of production, providing local employment and b eautifying the urbanized landscape. Container sales continue to dominate the product categories, accounting for 41 percent of the sales for all product types; this shar e is up 3 percent from 2003. Growth in sales of container plants accounted for 72 percent of the $65 mi llion increase realized by the industry in 2004. We would like to thank the many Oregon nurseries and greenhouses, the Oregon Association of Nurseries, the Oregon Depar tment of Agriculture, our crew of field interviewers, and others who provide information and suppor t for this important annual effort. Access to accurate and timely inform ation is critical to the continued success of this vital sector of Oregon agriculture. Sincerely, Janice A.

2004 Oregon nursery product sales set another record. Oregon’s horticulture industries continued to grow in 2004 with another record high sales value of $844 million for nursery and greenhouse products. This was the fifteenth year of this survey and the fourteenth year of record sales. Sales in 2004 climbe d 8 percent above 2003 and were over 2 times the sales of 1995. The horticulture industry conti nued to solidify its place above all other Oregon agricultural commodities, claiming nearly 21 percent of the total value of agricultural pr oduction. Cattle, with a value of $503 million, ranked second, while all hay and all milk claimed third and fourth places with sales of $382 million and $363 million, respectively. Seventy-two percent of the total $65 million sales increase this year was in Container sales, which increased 16 percent over l ast year, while Bare Root pr oducts gai ned 6 percent. Each category of plant material sales was higher in 2004 than in 2003, except for the other product category which remained the same as the previous year. Gross sales, when broken down by sales size groups, showed increases in all but one group. The largest size gr oup, 2+ million, increased 12 percent or $67.3 million over 2003. This increased value is mo re than the total increase because the $500,000 to $2 million sales size group was down 3 percent to 5.1 million from last year . This size group was down in sales value because many of these firms increased sales and moved into the 2+ million size group.

(continued from page 1) Firms with sales over $2 million made up 72.4 percent of all Oregon sales, and the total number of firms in this group increase d 8 firms to a total of 84 firms. Oregon’s top four counties of production, Clackamas, Washington, Marion, and Yamhill had with sales of $193.5 million, $191.2 m illion, $178.9 million and $115.9 million, respectively. In total, these four counties accounted for 81 percent of all the sales. When Multnomah county's sales of $49.0 million is included, the total value of production in the top five counties account for 86 percent of total production. Clacka mas county is still the major production area, but Ma rion county -- which has been the second largest county of production -- was replaced by Washington c ounty this year. Washington c ounty sales were only 2.3 million below Clackamas county and increased $27.5 m illion above last year. Given the number of growers and acres in production in Clackamas, Washington, and Marion, counties, any of these three could be the number one producer next year.

A stratifie d random sample of 752 names was selected from the State of Oregon’s list of licensed nurseries and gr eenhouses for 2004. They were classified into six broad size groups based on sales volume. The Oregon Agricultural Statistics Service's floriculture survey w as used to supplement the list for those firms who are not required to have a State license. Questionnaires were mailed to the sampled names on June 13, 2005, followed by a second request on July 7. All non-respondents were phoned or visited from July 27 to August 18. Cooperation was excellent with 92 percent of the sampled names partaicipating in the survey. Data for minor counties and items were combined with other totals to avoid disclosure of individual operations. The sample design was developed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Kent Hoddick of the Oregon Staff has been the survey coordinator of the Oregon Nursery and Greenhouse program since its inception in 1991. Oregon Nursery/Greenhouse 2004 3

DESTINATIONS OF OREGON NURSERY PRODUCT SALES SHIFTING Percentage wise, the following des tinations showed the strongest gains from the la st destination survey in 1999: Other Western States - up 46 percent ($19.2 million); Upper Midwest - up 67 percent ($52.9 million); Gulf States - up 39 percent ($6.9 million); Northeast States - up 48 percent ($39.4 mi llion); and Eastern Canada - up 146 percent ($11.1 million). All other destinations also increased but at lesser percent c hanges. Of course, Oregon remained the largest destinati on, increasing by $30.2 million dollars in sales delivered over 1999. Destination sale s as a percent of total Oregon sales produced showed increased sales in Other Western Sta tes, Upper Midwest, Gulf States, Nort heast States, and Eastern Canada, while all other regions declined in sales value share. Virtually all regions showed strong gains i n container sales delivered over 1999. Most regions showed good gains in Balled & Burlapped deliveries except Upper Midwest - no change, Atlantic States - declined, Northeast Stat es - declined, and Eastern Canada - declined. Bare root deliveries made modest gains in all regions except Or egon showed a slight decline. The Upper Midwest increased about 75 percent in deliveries for bare root material. Greenhouse and Other plant materials made good gains overall.
