General Filing Information Before transmitting live filings, so ftware developers must pass te sting procedures. For more information on testing procedures, see Publication EFAST-A, User’s Guide for Electronic/Magnetic Media Filing of Forms 5500 and 5500-EZ. Each transmission consists of a single or multiple batches of filings. A transmission may be sent via modem-to-modem or via magnetic media. There is no limit to the number of batches that can be sent for each transmission. For detailed modem-to-modem and magnetic media specifications, please see Section 9. A batch consists of a single or multiple filings . Each batch can contai n up to 1,000 filings. Transmissions must consist of only complete batches, and these batches must be transmitted in their entirety sequentially. That is, the first batch must be completely transmitted before the next batch begins. Figure 1, on the next page, shows the relations hip between transmissions and batches. Figure 1 Transmission and Batch

EFAST-B, Part I Draft Electroni c Filing Specification (DEL 1022) 18 September 2008 Page - 10 For Official Use Only 4.1 Parts of a Batch A batch consists of two or three different types of files: .DOL Files , Unstructured Attachment Files , and . RDY Files . The .DOL file contains the information from the offi cial forms and schedules (which are Form 5500, Form 5500-EZ, Schedule A, Schedule C, Sche dule D, Schedule E, Schedule G, Schedule H, Schedule I, Schedule R, and Schedule SSA). It also contains Unstructured Text Records, which are unstructured attachments submitted w ithin the .DOL file (see Section 5.7.6). The Unstructured Attachment Files are files containing information that is not contained on the official forms. Examples of unstructured attachme nts that must be contained in separate files include Schedule H Accountant’s Opinions and Schedules MB and SB Actuarial Attachments, and images of Schedules MB and SB. Please see Section 6 for more information on unstructured attachments. Images of pages for Schedules MB and SB must be included as unstructured filing attachments in PDF format. The .RDY file is transmitted after the .DOL f ile and the Unstructured Attachment Files for modem-to-modem batches only. It has the same filename as the .DOL file, except it has an “.RDY” extension. This file lets the EFAST modem-to-modem processing system know when the entire batch is completely transmitted and ready to be processed. Only modem-to-modem filers should transmit this file. See Section 11 for more details. The .DOL file can contain the information for up to 1,000 different filings. There can be up to 4,095 separate unstructured attachment files att ached to this .DOL file. These unstructured attachment files can belong to any of the filings that the .DOL file contains. That is, the unstructured attachment files in a batch do not necessar ily have to be attached to the same filing.

EFAST-B, Part I Draft Electroni c Filing Specification (DEL 1022) 18 September 2008 Page - 11 For Official Use Only 5. The .DOL File 1 File naming conventions The entire .DOL filename must not exceed 30 char acters (the dot and the extension not included) and must have “.DOL” as its extension. A transm itter should never submit a .DOL file that has the same filename as a previously transmitted .DOL file. That is, for each EFIN, all .DOL files transmitted should have unique names. If .DOL files are not named uniquely, there is a po ssibility that data could be overwritten. Also, the name of the .DOL file is used as identifi cation in the initial electronic acknowledgements. See Section 8.1 for details. Note : Even an amended file’s filename must be uni que. The filename is not used to identify amended filings, so please verify that the ame nded check box on the first page of Form 5500 (field B(2)) or Form 5500-EZ (field A(2))is selected if submitting an amended filing. 2 General .DOL File/Record Information The .DOL file must be an ASCII text file. Each record within a transmission must be preced ed by two four-byte fields. The first four-byte field is the Byte Count for the record. This byte count contains a count of the number of bytes within the record includ ing the four bytes for the counter itself, four bytes for the Record Beginning Mark (****), and one byte for the Record Terminus Character (#). The second four-byte field is the Record Beginning Mark , which must be four asterisks (****). Every record must have the Record Term inus Character (#) as its last byte. A .DOL file consists of a variable number of fixed length and variable length records. The size and format of the record for each page of each fo rm and schedule are specified in Part II Record Layouts. No page of a schedule or form should be generate d if there are no entries on that page record. A blank page (Record ID only) may cause the f iling to be deemed non-acceptable, except in cases where a form requires that one page be present when the other page is present. Page one of Form 5500 or of Form 5500-EZ must have a record present. For the Schedules, only the pages (in the proper sequence) which contain si gnificant data must have a record present. If page 2 and/or any succeeding page of any sche dule contains significant data, page 1 of that schedule must also be present and must contain significant data. 3 Types of Records in the .DOL File A .DOL file consists of a TRANS Record , the Encryption Record (if applicable), the Filings , and a RECAP Record . The Filings consist of a single Header Record , all Filing Records (one for each page of the 5500 or 5500-EZ), Schedule Records (one for each page of each schedule) , Unstructured Attachment Indicator Records (one for each file attached to the filing), Unstructured Text

EFAST-B, Part I Draft Electroni c Filing Specification (DEL 1022) 18 September 2008 Page - 12 For Official Use Only Records (one for each textual attachment submitted inside the DOL file), and a single Summary Record . There should be no spaces, carriage returns, or an y other characters between records in a .DOL file.

EFAST-B, Part I Draft Electroni c Filing Specification (DEL 1022) 18 September 2008 Page - 13 For Official Use Only 5.4 .DOL File Sequence of Data The .DOL must be transmitted in the following sequence: The TRANS record. The Encryption Record (if applicable, see Section 10). The Header Record for the first filing. All the Filing Records for the first filing. All the Schedule Records for the first filing. All the Unstructured Attachment Indi cator Records for the first filing. All the Unstructured Attachment Text Records for the first filing. The Summary Record for the first filing. The Header Record for the next filing. All the Filing Records for the next filing. All the Schedule Records for the next filing. All the Unstructured Attachment Indicator Records for the next filing. All the Unstructured Attachment Text Records for the next filing. The Summary Record for the next filing. Note : For each DOL file, the information for up to 1,000 filings may be transmitted in this manner. Schedules A, C, D, E, G, H, I, R, and SSA must be in alphabetical sequence. All records must appear in the proper sequence, with the proper control information, and the counts of the schedules must balance with the Summary Record or the filing may be deemed non-acceptable. Schedules MB and SB are to be included as unstr uctured filing attachments in PDF format and not in the data stream with the other forms and schedules. 5 .DOL File Character Sets This section identifies the types of characters that are valid for an electronically filed return. All .DOL files must be in ASCII character code. The following four characters: “ [“ , “]”, “*”, and “ #” are reserved as delimiters and cannot appear as data characters . The left ([) and right (]) brackets enclose Field Sequence Numbers. Asterisk (*) characters mark the beginning of a record. The Pound Sign (#) (Record Terminus Character) indicates the end of a record. ALL ALPHABETIC DATA MUST BE IN UPPER CASE! Preparation software must ensure that lower case alphabetic characters are not entered. “SEE ATTACHED ” or any similar wording is not acceptable as an entry for any field. Section 6 provides guidance on submitting attached files. Except where designated, do not enter bl anks or spaces between data elements. The symbol b may be used in this publication to represent a blank character position.

EFAST-B, Part I Draft Electroni c Filing Specification (DEL 1022) 18 September 2008 Page - 15 For Official Use Only 5.6.2 Variable Format Option The variable length option provides for the transmission of only control information, significant data fields , and significant data within individual fields . Filing , Schedule, and Unstructured Attachment Text Records must always be in variable format . All other records must be in fixed format. The following data field conventions must be followed when transmitting variable format records: 6.2.1 Form and Schedule Records – Variable Format When transmitting in variable format, each Filing, Schedule, and Unstructured Attachment Text Record will begin with a byte count and a r ecord beginning mark, followed by the control information for that record. These fields (fields 1-11 for Filing and Schedule, fields 1-15 for Unstructured Attachment Text) are in the same fixe d format shown in Sections 5.7.3, 5.7.4, and 7.6.1. Following this control information are the data fields. Each data field is preceded by the applicable four-digit Field Sequence Number, which is enclosed by square bracket field delimiters. The Record Terminus Character (#) follows the last data field in the record. It appears immediately after the last data field. The start of the next record must immediately follow the terminus character (no blanks, spaces, or other characters are allowed between records). 6.2.2 Numeric Fields – Variable Format All numeric fields must use numeric characters only: 0 – 9. Unsigned numeric fields: Leading zeros may be dropped. Signed numeric fields (money amounts): Leading zeros are dropped. For a positive value, the trailing blank that indicates a gain is dropped. For a negative value in a field that can contain either a gain or a loss, the minus sign (-) can be en tered in the first or last position of the signed numeric field. Signed numeric fields that can also contain literal values. Enter signed numeric fields as described above. When entering a literal value, le ft-justify the field; it is not necessary to enter trailing blanks. Special fields: Date M = Month, D = Day, Y = Year (YYYY, MMYYYY, MMDDYYYY, YYYYMMDD). Leading zeros cannot be dropped. Money Amount Enter whole dollar amounts (do not enter cents). Leading zeros are dropped. For a positive value, the trailing blank that indicates a gain is dropped. For a negative value in a field that can contain either a gain or a loss, the minus sign (-) can be present in the first or last position of the signed numeric field. Omit non-significant fields.

EFAST-B, Part I Draft Electroni c Filing Specification (DEL 1022) 18 September 2008 Page - 16 For Official Use Only Percent Fields Most percent fields are four positions in le ngth. Decimal points and any other non-numeric characters should not be entered in any percent fiel d. Some of the percent fields will contain one or more implied fixed decimal positions (all fiel ds that contain implied decimal positions are indicated as such in Part II, Record Layouts). Da ta entered in these fields will be considered as right justified and zero filled to the left of the im plied decimal and left justified and zero filled to the right of the implied decimal. For example, 7.5 % should be entered as “0750” in a field with two implied decimal places and as “0075” in a fiel d with one implied decimal place. All percent fields that do NOT have implied decimals should be right justified and zero filled. 6.2.3 Alphanumeric Fields – Variable Format Left-justify data in the field.

Unstructured Attachment Files Any information that cannot be contained on the 5500 series Forms and Schedules may be submitted as an unstructured attachment. Exam ples of unstructured attachments include Schedules MB or SB Actuarial attachments, Sc hedule H Accountant’s Opinion attachments, and extension forms. There are two types of unstructu red attachments: 1) Unstructured attachments submitted as separate files to the DOL file and 2) unstructured attachments submitted within the DOL file. Images of pages for Schedules MB and SB in PDF format must be included as unstructured filing attachments. A filing may have up to 4,095 unstr uctured attachments submitted as sep arate files, in addition to 4,095 unstructured attachments submitted within the DOL file. Unstructured attachments are att ached to the entire DOL file, not to a specific filing. Please see Section 4.1 for details. 1 Naming Conventions Each unstructured attachment file must have the same filename as the .DOL file. The extension of these unstructured attachment files must be a three-digit hexadecimal number (001-FFF). This number must be unique for each file in a transmission. For example, if the NEWPLAN.DOL file containe d two filings with two attachments each, those attachments would be named NEWPLAN.001, NEWPLAN.002, NEWPLAN.003, and NEWPLAN.004. Please note three-digit hexadecimal number is a counter of the attachment’s place in a transmission, not its place in a filing. 2 Transmission Sequence All unstructured attachments must be transmitted af ter the .DOL file to which they are attached and before the next .DOL file in the tran smission (for both modem and magnetic media). See Figure 1 for an illustration. See Sections 9.3.5 a nd 9.3.6 for instructions on loading to magnetic media. 3 Acceptable Formats The following table lists the acceptable formats of the unstructured attachment files, as well as the minimum version required for each format: FORMAT MINIMUM VERSION ASCII character (text) format -- Microsoft Word document format 6.0 Corel WordPerfect document format 6.0 Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) 3.0 Hypertext-Markup Language (HTML) format -- Microsoft Excel format 5.0 Lotus 1-2-3 format 3.0

Validation Criteria The electronic filing system has two sets of validation criteria: one for live filings, and one for test filings. 1 Live Filing Validation Criteria The electronic filing system performs initial checks and sends initial electronic acknowledgements for live filings. These initial valid ation criteria include basic format checks, virus checks, etc. If a filing is deemed non-acceptable for these initial checks, it is not processed any further. If a filing passes these initial checks, that filing is passed on to a further processing system. However, the electronic filing system does not repor t any information about the tests done in that further processing system. That is, the electronic system does NO T report final acceptance or rejection of live filings . 1.1 Live Filing Rejection Errors Following are initial rejection errors that may occur when filing electronic/external media filing. Initial Live #0003 Non-Standard Form or Schedule. You have submitted a Form or Schedule which cannot be processed in our Annual Repo rt processing environment.

Acknowledgement Format 1 Acknowledgement File For each batch of filings transmitted, the electr onic filing system generates an acknowledgement file. The acknowledgement file is an ASCII text file. This acknowledgement file has the same name as the .DOL file of the transmitted batch. Thus, a transmitter transmitted a DOL file named: 01252001_001.DOL. The electronic filing system ge nerates an acknowledgement file with the name of 01252001_001.ACK . For more information on DOL file naming conventions, see Section 5.1. These acknowledgement files are placed in a directory named according to the transmitter’s six- digit EFIN directory. This acknowledgement file is either an initial acknowledgement for all live batches submitted or a final acknowledgement for all test batches submitted. For more information, see Section 7. For more information about the technical specifi cations for the acknowledgement file, including the phone number to dial, see Section 9.2. 2 General Format Information Acknowledgement records are of fixed length format but the varying number of filings in a batch and the varying number of errors means that there are varying numbers of records in each acknowledgement batch. Each record contains 72 bytes. The acknowledgement file itself is one file consisti ng of a number of records. The batch is first acknowledged in an ACKB Record. If the batch cannot be decrypted, contains a virus or is in an invalid format, the ACKB Record is followe d by an ACKT Record listing the error(s) acknowledgement file in the batch. No f ilings are acknowledged if an ACKT exists. If the batch is deemed acceptable for processi ng, an ACK Key Record exists for each filing within the transmitted batch. The ACK Key R ecord is followed by ACK Error Record(s) for each filing deemed non-acceptable within the ba tch. Once all filings are acknowledged, a RECAP Record exists to summarize the acknowledgement file. 3 Unique Numbers Assigned by the Electronic Filing System 3.1 DLN The DLN (Document Locator Number) is a unique fourteen digit number that the EFAST Electronic Filing System assigns to each filing it processes. Both live and PATS filings receive DLNs, regardless of whether the filings are de emed acceptable or non-acceptable for processing. The DLN of each filing deemed non-acceptable is included in the acknowledgements the EFAST Electronic Filing System issues. You may need this number in order for the EFAST Electronic System to provide quick and accurate user s upport. This number is formatted as follows: • Digits 1 and 2 are always 55 (the code for EF). • Digit 3 always is 0. • Digits 4 and 5 indicate the type of filing: 31 = 5500EZ and 37 = 5500.

EFAST-B, Part I Draft Electroni c Filing Specification (DEL 1022) 18 September 2008 Page - 53 For Official Use Only • Digit 6 indicates the last digit of the processing year . The digit “4” indicates the year 2004. The digit “5” indicates the year 2005, and so on. This number changes each January 1. • Digits 7 , 8 and 9 indicate the Julian processing date of the transaction. • Digits 10 , 11, 12, 13, and 14 are the sequential number of the filing for the day. 3.2 Batch ID The Batch ID is a unique ten digit number that the EFAST Electronic Filing System assigns to each batch it processes. Both live and PATS batch es receive Batch IDs regardless of whether the batch is deemed acceptable or non-acceptable for processing. The Batch ID of each batch deemed non-accepta ble is included in the acknowledgements the EFAST Electronic Filing System issues. You may need this number in order for the EFAST Electronic System to provide quick and accurate user support. 4 Receiving Acknowledgements To receive acknowledgements: • Set up a Dial-up networking connection to the MCI service on Windows 95/98, or set up a RAS session via Windows NT. You must have Ve rsion 1.3 or greater of Dial-up Networking installed on your Windows 95/98 operati ng system. Phone number: 888 273-9539. • Use the EFIN for the user name a nd the password for the password. • Establish an FTP connection to the EFAST server. IP address: 192.168.20.70. Use the EFIN for the user name and the password for the passwor d. You must enable binary transfer mode. • The system automatically transfers you to your user directory. At this time, all *.ack files may be downloaded via FTP. 5 ACK Batch Record Following is the format for the ACKB R ecord of the acknowledgement file.

EFAST-B, Part I Draft Electroni c Filing Specification (DEL 1022) 18 September 2008 Page - 61 For Official Use Only In order to transfer the .DOL to the tape, you must first choose a block size for the tape. Then, write the binary .DOL file to the tape. Fill each fixed block on the tape completely with data from the .DOL file before beginning to write to the next block. If the size of your .DOL file is not a multiple of the fixed block size you have chosen (and, in most cases, it will not be), the size of the last block on the tape should match the size of the remaining data. Example: You have a .DOL file is that is 16,385 bytes, an d you choose to put that file on a tape which has a fixed block size of 8192. The first block on the magnetic tape would c ontain the first 8192 bytes from the .DOL file. The second block on the magnetic tape would cont ain the second 8192 bytes from the .DOL file. The third block on the magnetic tape would contain the final single byte from the .DOL file. That is, Block 1 = 8192 bytes Block 2 = 8192 bytes Block 3 = 1 byte Total = 16,385 bytes All users of tape media, whether they use the STK Redwood, STK 9840, IBM 3590, IBM 3490E, DAT, Exabyte, DLT, or any other type of media, must use magnetic labels . The format of these labels is defined by ANSI Standard X 3.27, a nd major computer suppliers such as IBM provide relevant documentation. One such manual published by IBM is: Using Magnetic Tape Labels and File Structure SC26-4565 (1991) Reading tapes after creation for verification. Labeled Tapes Finding the maximum block size of a tape: The maximum block size can be found by issuing a “Scan Tape” command. In the case of a labeled tape, the block size can be found in the HDR2 label. For example, HDR2F 08192 00132... shows a file of fixed length records with a maximum block size of Finding the record length of a tape: If the tape is labeled, again the information can be found in the HDR2 label. For example, HDR2F08192 00132 ... shows a file of fixed length records with a record length of 132.

EFAST-B, Part I Draft Electroni c Filing Specification (DEL 1022) 18 September 2008 Page - 62 For Official Use Only Unlabeled Tapes If the tape is unlabeled, and without knowledge of how the tape was written, the only way to find out the size of the records is by inspec ting the tape and counting the bytes. This is why it is important to use labels. 3.5 INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING FILINGS ON MAGNETIC TAPES All magnetic tape submissi ons should be formatted according to ANSI Standard X3.27-1987 (rev 1998) . See Section 9.3.3 for magnetic media sequence. The filename of each .DOL file must be unique. See Section 5.1. The filename of the unstructured attachment files must correspond to the guidelines in Section 6.1. 3.6 INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING FILINGS ON CD-ROM OR DISKETTE All files transmitted on CD-ROM or Diskette must be in the root directory of the media. Files on CD-ROM or diskette must be submitted in the following order: First .DOL file and all the unstructured attachments attached to that .DOL file, next .DOL file and all the unstructured attachments attached to that .DOL file, etc. Figure 1, Section 4. The filename of each .DOL file must be unique. See Section 5.1. The filename of the unstructured attachment files must correspond to the guidelines in Section 6.1. 3.7 LABELING ON ALL MEDIA A transmitter must place a label on both the packaging of the media and on each piece of media itself. These labels should be identical. Th ey should both have the following information on separate lines of the label: • Media Type – This indicates the kind of media bei ng submitted; the choices are: Diskette, CD-ROM, 9-Track Magnetic Tape, 3480/349 0 Cartridge, 8mm DAT, or 4mm DAT. • ASCII character set indication – If you are submitting 9-Tr ack or 3480/3490 magnetic tapes, you must indicate that the tape is in the ASCII character set. All other media does not require this indication. • Record length indication – If you are submitting 9-Track or 3480/3490 magnetic tapes, you must indicate the tape’s record length. All other media does not require this indication. • Block size indication – If you are submitting 9-Track or 34 80/3490 magnetic tapes, you must indicate the tape’s block size. All other media does not require this indication. • Media ID – This line must always read: “EFAST Processing System”. • Transmitter’s Name – The name of the company submitting magnetic media. • Transmitter’s Contact Name – The contact name at the company submitting magnetic media. • Transmitter’s EIN – EIN of the company submitting magnetic media. • Transmitter’s EFIN – EFIN of the company submitting magnetic media. • Date Created – The date that the data or informati on was created and stored on media.

Encryption Prior to transmission into the EFAST host system, all .DOL files and their attachment files sent modem-to-modem must be encrypted. Files may be encrypted in one of two ways: Developers may choose to develop their own encr yption systems that are compatible with the system outlined in Section 10.1. The developers of such a system are responsible for ensuring compatibility with the EFAST system by adheri ng to this document and any documents to which this document refers. Developers can use Windows based dynamic link libraries (DLLs) which perform all the necessary encryption operations. This op tion is detailed in Section 10.2. 1 Developing Your Own Encryption System 1.1 Required Encryption Algorithm The cryptographic algorithm that is required is the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm. The X9 ANSI committee has documented this algorithm in their publication ANSI X9.52. Further documentation is available from the National Institu te of Standards and Technology (NIST). Such documents are called Federal Information Processi ng Standards Publications (FIPS Pub). FIPS Pub 46-2 and Draft FIPS Pub 46-3 document th e Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Triple DES respectively. At the time of this writing, the NIST prov ided access to FIPS Pub 46-2 on the web at http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip46-2.htm; the NIST also provided access to the Draft FIPS Pub 46-3 on the web at http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/des/fr990115.htm . 1.2 Triple DES Encryption Requirements The EFAST system currently supports the Trip le DES encryption algorithm. The information required by the encryption algorithm follows: Encryption Mode: Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode Block Size: 8 byte blocks (each byte is 8 bits) Initialization Vector (Hexadecimal): BD 6C C2 FE 32 3E B2 C9 Cryptographic Key: 192-bit keys are issued once an application is accepted Note : A Triple DES encryption key is three successive DES encryption keys. Each DES key is a 56-bit key with 8-bits of parity. Therefore, an EFAST Triple DES key has a key-space of 168-bits and 24 parity bits. 1.3 Required Steps to Encrypt an EFAST .DOL File and Attachments

EFAST-B, Part I Draft Electroni c Filing Specification (DEL 1022) 18 September 2008 Page - 65 For Official Use Only 10.1.3.1 Encryption Record Every encrypted EFAST file must have an encrypti on record inserted just prior to the encrypted data. That record is formatted as follows: Encryption Record no. Identification Length Type Start pos. Description 1 Byte Count 4 N 1 Byte Count of Encryption Record. Value = “0040” 2 Record Beginning Mark 4 A/N 5 Value = “****” 3 Record ID 5 A/N 9 Value = “CRYPT” 4 Type of Encryption 4 A/N 14 Four-digit code that indicates the type of encryption used to encrypt the file. For pilot, will always be “TDEA” (Which stands for Triple Data Encryption Algorithm). 5 Length of encrypted data 10 N 18 Byte count of encrypted data, including padded bytes. 6 Number of bytes padded to the end of the encrypted data 6 28 Count of how many extra bytes needed to be padded to the end of the encrypted data. In the .DOL file, the “encrypted data” is the entirety of information between the TRANS and RECAP records. In an unstructured attachment, the “encrypted data” is the entirety of the data of the file. 7 Reserved 6 34 Terminus Character 1 A/N 40 Value = # Note: The Encryption Record contains fields for the Length of Encrypted Data (Data Length) and the Number of Bytes Padded (Padded Length). Block encryption algorithms require that encrypted data be a multiple of the block size for that block encryption algorithm. If the length of the encrypted data is a multiple of the block size, then the Padded Length must be zero. Otherwise, the en crypted data written to .DOL file or the Filing Attachment File must be padded out to a multiple of the block size and the Data Length field must be adjusted to reflect th e change. Also, the Padded Length field must be set to the number of bytes that were padded/added. For example, if you need to encrypt 123 bytes, the Length of encrypted data field (Field 5) must read 128, and the Number of bytes padded to the end of the en crypted information (Field 6) must read 5. 1.3.2 Steps for Encrypting The steps for encrypting follow (repeat this procedure for each batch): 1) Prepare the .DOL file and all of its associated attachments so that they are completed and ready to be filed 2) Repeat step 2.a for each attachment to be filed with the .DOL File a) Encrypt the Attachment

EFAST-B, Part I Draft Electroni c Filing Specification (DEL 1022) 18 September 2008 Page - 67 For Official Use Only Section 10.1, including creating encryption records, and encrypting only the required portions of the batch. The Windows EFAST encryption libraries consist of a commercial encryption algorithm library and an EFAST custom encryption library. The co mmercial encryption library is used by the EFAST custom encryption library. The EFAST encryption library exposes an encryption algorithm and a decryption algorithm which develope rs can call directly to completely handle their EFAST encryption needs. The decryption algorithm is available for decrypting files that have been encrypted, thus checking the encryption process. Howeve r, only the encryption algorith m is needed. The Encryption Algorithm and the Decryption Algorithm are detailed on the next page. The parameter types can be found in the .h file (see Section 10.2.2). 2.1.1 Encryption Algorithm: EFAST_EncryptDOL( Key, PlainTextPath, CipherTextPath, DOLBatchFile ) Parameters: Key: Encryption Key PlainTextPath: Path to the unencrypted files CipherTextPath: Path to where the encrypted files are to be written DOLBatchFile: .DOL File Name (NO PATH) Returns: An integer code which indicates either Success or a reason for the Failure Description: EFAST_EncryptDOL() parses the passed in .DOL file and looks for attachment file records. Each attachment file is encrypted as attachment file records are found. Finally, the .DOL file is encrypted. Note : PlainTextPath and CipherTextPath MUST be in different locations on the system. The file names for the encrypted files are th e same as the file names for the unencrypted files. 2.1.2 Decryption Algorithm: EFAST_DecryptDOL( Key, CipherTextPath, PlainTextPath, DOLBatchFile ) Parameters: Key: Encryption Key CipherTextPath: Path to the encrypted files

Each attachment file is decrypted as attachment file records are found. Note: PlainTextPath and CipherTextPath MUST be in different locations on the system. The file names for the encrypted files are th e same as the file names for the unencrypted files. 2.2 Language Support Currently, development files exist to support EFA ST Encryption Library integration into C/C++ applications. Support for other languages and de velopment systems can be added as needed during scale up. In addition to the encryption .D LL, developers will need the following encryption libraries to encrypt filings: EFCRYP32.DLL - EFAST Encryption DLL EFCRYP32.H - C/C++ Header File EFCRYP32.BAS - Visual Basic 5 and 6 definition file. EFCRYP32.LIB - Borland C++ Builder Link Library for EFAST Encryption DLLs TDCIPH32.DLL - Required Encryption Library The EFCRYPT32.DLL, EFCRYP32.H, EFCRYP32.BAS, and EFCRYP32.LIB Windows libraries are freely available by emailing: ron.zook@vangent.com The TDCIPH32.DLL Windows library is ava ilable for purchase from Bokler Software: www.bokler.com The name of the required Bokler Software product is: TDESSCIPHER/DLL

The .RDY File The last file in each modem-to-modem batch must be an “.RDY” file. This .RDY file has the same filename as the .DOL file, except it has an “. RDY” extension. For example, the .DOL file ABCINCPLAN111.DOL file would submit a ABCI NCPLAN111.RDY file. This .RDY file may be a zero-byte file. The modem-to-modem pr ocessing system will not process a batch unless it receives a .RDY file.

(See Section 5.5). • Header (HDR) and Summary (SUM) records are REQUIRED for EACH filing. (See Section 5.3). • If page 2 and/or any succeeding page of any sche dule contains significant data, page 1 of that schedule must also be present and must contain significant data. (See Section 5.2). • Field 0220 on Form 5500 is a required date field. (See EFAST-B, Part II). • You must format the records listed in Section 5.7 correctly. Otherwise, multiple errors may be reported. • There cannot be any extra carriage returns at the end of any record (including the last record of the file). (See Section 5.6.2.1). • If submitting magnetic media, You must provide ap propriate external labeling. (See Section 3.7). Be sure to include a company contact na me on all external labels. All magnetic tapes must be submitted with appropriate intern al labeling. (See Section 9.3.4). • Extension Forms such as Form 5558, 4868, 7004, 2688, and 2758 must be filed as an unstructured attachment. (See Sections 5.7.5 & 6.) • If filing for an extension using any of the above forms, the following text should be written in the unstructured attachment: “A paper copy of Form 5558, Application for Extension of Time to File Certain Employee Plan Returns*, has been filed with the IRS for this plan.” This statement is made under penalty of perjury: Th e form referred to in this statement MUST have been filed with the IRS. • (* - Substitute the Form number and Form name of the Extension that was filed. If Form 2688 or Form 2758 are filed, the extension date must also be included in this text.) • External Media filers can retrieve an Acknowledgement by following modem dial up procedures. • A Signer is not associated to EIN. Box D on the EFAST-1 only updat es Transmitters, and/or Software Developers. If you want to update a Signer, you have to submit an EFAST-1 or call the Consolidated HelpDesk. • The following fields cannot be blank for ELF filings . If there is no value, enter 0 in the field: • Form 5500, page 2: Fields 0620, 0660, and 0680.
