Discovery The Court allows six months, but may extend, depending on agreement of counsel. Discovery motions are referred to a Magistrate Judge. The motion cutoff can be extended before and after the cutoff date by stipulation of the parties; however, if the extension interferes with the trial date, it is generally not allowed.
