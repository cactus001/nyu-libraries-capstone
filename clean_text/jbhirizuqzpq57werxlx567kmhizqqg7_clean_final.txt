Standing for Veterans receive the benefits they have earned and deserve. Congressman Rooney has been a tireless advocate bringing awareness to the growing number of troops and veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, depression, and other invisible wounds. He has worked to improve mental health services, increase funding for treatment, and expand access to licensed mental health professionals for TRICARE beneficiaries. He has stood firm against increases in TRICARE fees for veterans and military families, and has worked across the aisle to combat veteran homelessness. One of Congressman Rooney’s top priorities for improving services for America’s veterans reducing the disability claims backlog at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Despite more than four years of promises from the Obama Administration to eliminate the backlog, the situation has only grown worse. The number of unprocessed claims will soon reach one million, and nearly all claims are still processed on paper, rather than online. Congressman Rooney firmly believes this is unacceptable. He helped lead a bipartisan group of veterans in Congress in writing a letter to President Obama urging him to take immediate action to reduce the backlog and improve VA services. Congressman Rooney firmly believes we have a moral obligation to care for those who served. He will continue holding the VA accountable for providing the very best services possible for our returning war fighters, their families and veterans.
