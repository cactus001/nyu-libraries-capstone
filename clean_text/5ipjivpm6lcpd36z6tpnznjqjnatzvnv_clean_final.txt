Document	Level	Adjustment	Business	Rules Last updated 8/25/2016 Page 1General Information To correct incorrectly recorded costs, adjustments shoul d be made at the document or detail level to provide an adequate audit trail. Document Level Adjustments (DLA’s) should be used to correct f ully disbursed obligations and no match transactions. Please note the DLA process transfers costs, not resources. The process transfers dollar amounts as paid costs. For partially disbursed obliga tions, modifications should be processed through the normal obligation channels (Contracts/ Grants through AGO and Legacy/ Interagency Agreements through the Finance Office). Amounts in undelivered orders cannot be transferred using the DLA process. Bankcard reconciliation errors can also be adjusted using DLAs. Required Approvals ALL DLA’S regardless of the amount must be reviewed and approved with signatures by the Originator’s Supervisor or equivalent before being submitted to AOD for posting. [See CBS Document Level Adjustment Approval Form] DLA’S regardless of the amount between two different fund codes and or program codes, or any docume nt level adjus t ment of $500K or more MUST be reviewed and approved with signatures by the LO/SO Budget Execution Lead AND the LO Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or Staff Office Director, AND the NOAA or BIS Budget Execution Office (BEX) before being submitted to AOD for posting. [See CBS Document Level Adjustment Approval Form] Transfers between Organizations and/or Financial Management Centers (FMCs): Any DLA that is transferring costs between organizations and/or FMCs requires the signed approval of the affected organization. The originator of the DLA must obtain the signed approval form from the affected organization which contains a statement that they concur with the DLA action and it is appropriate for approval. [See CBS Document Level Adjustment Approval Form] Business Rules for Docu ment Level Adjustments The following NOAA Business Rules apply when pr ocessing DLAs using the CBS Payment Management PM006- Advice of Correction Transaction Screen. See the Document Level Adjustment Standard Operating Procedures for internal finance office adjustments. FROM and TO Fund Code Fiscal Year must Match. Both the ‘FROM’ and ‘TO’ sides of a transaction must cite the same Fund Code Fiscal Year (FCFY). Co sts from one FCFY may not be transferred into another FCFY. For example, costs recorded against FC FY 2011 may not be transferred into FCFY 2012. The only exceptions are: FCFY Exception 1 : No Match Overruns - FCFY can only move forward from a prior FCFY to the current FCFY. [Exception must be noted in business rules violation justification] FCFY Exception 2 : Interest Penalties - For object class 43-01, FCFY can only move forward from a prior FCFY to the current FCFY. [ This exception should be exercised if no other recourse is available. Exception must be noted in business rules violation justification]
