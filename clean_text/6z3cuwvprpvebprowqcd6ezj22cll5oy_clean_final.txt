(1) The color additive D&C Red No. 36 is 1-[(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol (CAS Reg. No. 2814 –77–9). The color additive is manufactured by diazotization of 2-chloro-4-nitrobenzenamine in acid me-dium and coupling with 2-naphthalenol in acid medium. (2) Color additive mixtures for drug use made with D&C Red No. 36 may contain only those diluents that are suitable and that are listed in part 73 of this chapter as safe for use in color additive mixtures for coloring drugs. (b) Specifications. D&C Red No. 36 shall conform to the following speci-fications and shall be free from impuri-ties other than those named to the ex-tent that such impurities may be avoided by current good manufacturing practice: Volatile matter at 135 °C (275 °F), not more than 1.5 percent. Matter insoluble in toluene, not more than 5 percent. 2-Chloro-4-nitrobenzenamine, not more than 3 percent. 2-Naphthalenol, not more than 1 percent. 2,4-Dinitrobenzenamine, not more than 0.02 percent. 1-[(2,4-Dinitrophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol, not more than 0.5 percent. 4-[(2-Chloro-4-nitrophenyl)azo]-1- naphthalenol, not more than 0.5 percent. 1-[(4-Nitrophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol, not more than 0.3 percent. 1-[(4-Chloro-2-nitrophenyl)azo]-2- naphthalenol, not more than 0.3 percent. Lead (as Pb), not more than 20 parts per mil- lion. Arsenic (as As), not more than 3 parts per million. Mercury (as Hg), not more than 1 part per million. Total color, not less than 95 percent. (c) Uses and restrictions. The color ad- ditive D&C Red No. 36 may be safely used for coloring ingested drugs, other than mouthwashes and dentifrices, in amounts not to exceed 1.7 milligrams per daily dose of the drug for drugs that are taken continuously only for less than 1 year. For drugs taken con-tinuously for longer than 1 year, the color additive shall not be used in amounts to exceed 1.0 milligram per daily dose of the drug. D&C Red No. 36 may be safely used for coloring exter-nally applied drugs in amounts con-sistent with current good manufac-turing practice. (d) Labeling requirements. The label of the color additive and any mixtures prepared therefrom intended solely or in part for coloring purposes shall con-form to the requirements of §70.25 of this chapter. (e) Certification. All batches of D&C Red No. 36 shall be certified in accord-ance with regulations in part 80 of this chapter.
