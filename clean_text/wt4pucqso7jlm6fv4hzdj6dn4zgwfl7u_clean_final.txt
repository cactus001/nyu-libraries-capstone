Out-of-State Waste The Commonwealth is the second highest importer of out-of-state waste in the country, and I am committed to advocating policies that give Virginia more authority to regulate how much trash we receive. Virginia accepts trash from other states that do not have as stringent standards on what you can put in landfills. Therefore, this waste is contaminating our landfills. Not only does it create an environmental problem, it is also a safety issue. Often, the trucks hauling the waste do not meet safety standards and pose a risk to those on the road. I am committed to making the Commonwealth cleaner and safer by fighting out-of-state waste. The Online Office of Congressman Rob Wittman http://www.wittman.house.gov Powered by Joomla!
