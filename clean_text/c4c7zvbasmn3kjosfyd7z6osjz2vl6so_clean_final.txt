The PA or CRNP must send a copy of the prescripti ve authority granted by the licensing board in order for the PA or CRNP to be added to the Provider License File for the purpose of reimbursing the phar macist for the prescriptions written by the PA or CRNP. This copy must be sent to EDS Provider Enrollment, P.O. Box 241685, AL 36124-1685. EDS will not enroll physicians havi ng limited licenses unless complete information as to the limitations and re asons are submitted in writing to the Provider Enrollment Unit for review and consideration for enrollment. 2 Benefits and Limitations This section describes program-specif ic benefits and limitations. Refer to Chapter 3, Verifying Recipient Eligib ility, for general benefit information and limitations. Physicians are expected to render medically necessary services to Medicaid patients in the same manner and under the same standards as for their private patients, and bill t he Alabama Medicaid Agency their usual and customary fee. A physician enrolled in and providing services through an approved residency training program will be assigned a pseudo Medicaid license number, but may not bill fo r services performed as part of the residency training program. A pseudo Medicaid license number is required on written prescriptions issued to Medicaid recipients. To request a pseudo Medicaid license number, please refer to Chapter 2, Becoming a Medicaid provider for additional information. Written medication prescriptions should have a typed or printed name of the prescriber on the prescription, handwriting should be legible, and the pseudo license number for a resident should be clearly indicated.

Physician 28-4 October 2005 Payments from Medicaid funds can be made only to physicians who provide the services; therefore, no reimbursement can be made to patients who may personally pay for the service rendered. Reimbursement may be made to a physician submitting a claim for services furnished by another physician in the event there is a reciprocal arrangement as long as block 19 on the claim identifies the physician who actually furnished the service. Bo th physicians should be enrolled as Medicaid providers. The reciprocal arrangement may not exceed 14 days in the case of an informal arrangement or 90 continuous days in the case of an arrangement involving per diem or other fee-for-time compensation. Providers participating in a reciproc al arrangement should be enrolled with the Alabama Medicaid Agency. The physician agrees when billing Medica id for a service that the physician will accept as payment in full, the amou nt paid by Medicaid for that service, plus any cost-sharing amount to be paid by the recipient, and that no additional charge will be made. Conditional collections from patients, made before Medicaid pays, which are to be refunded after Medicaid pays, are not permissible. The physician may bill the patient, in addition to the cost-sharing fee, for services rendered w hen benefit limitations are exhausted for the year or when the service is a Medicaid non-covered benefit. However, the provider (or their staff) must advise each patient prior to services being rendered when Medica id payment will not be accepted, and the patient will be responsible for the b ill. If a provider routinely accepts a Medicaid assignment, he or she may not bill Medicaid or the recipient for a service he or she did not provide, i.e., missed or canceled appointment. A hospital-based physician-employed by and paid by a hospital may not bill Medicaid for services performed for which the hospital is reimbursed. A hospital-based physician shall bill t he Medicaid Program on a CMS-1500, Health Insurance Claim Form or assign their billing rights to the hospital, which shall bill the Medicaid Program on a CMS-1500 form. A hospital-based physician who is not employed by and paid by a hospital may bill Medicaid using a CMS-1500 claim form. A physician enrolled in a residency training program and whose practice is limited to the institution in which t hat resident is pl aced shall not bill Medicaid for services performed t herein for which the institution is reimbursed through the hospitals' cost reports. For tracking purposes, these physicians will be assigned pseudo Medicaid license numbers. Hospital-based physicians are reimbu rsed under the same general system as is used in Medicare. Bills for serv ices rendered are submitted as follows: • All hospital-based physicians, incl uding emergency room physicians, radiologists, and pathologists, will bill Medicaid on a CMS-1500 claim form, or assign their billing rights to the hospital, which shall bill Medicaid on a CMS-1500 claim form. • Physician services personally r endered for individual patients will be paid only on a reasonable charge basis (i.e., claims submitted under an individual provider number on a physician claim form). This includes services provided by a r adiologist and/or pathologist. • Reasonable charge services are: 1) personally furnished for a patient by a physician; 2) ordinarily require performance by a physician and; 3) contribute to the diagnosis or treatment of an individual patient.

All services requiring additional educ ation and training beyond the scope of practice billed by a CRNP/PA must be documented in the approved collaborative agreement from the B oard of Medical Examiners (BME) and the Alabama Board of Nursing (ABN) between the practitioner and physician. The only exception is for those “routine” services within the scope of practice approved by the applicable licensing and governing boards. Services billed outside a CRNP/PA scope of practice and/or collaborative agreement are subj ect to post-payment review. Medicaid will make payment for services of Physician Assistants (PAs) and Certified Registered Nurse Practi tioners (CRNPs) who are legally authorized to furnish services and who render the services under the supervision of an employing physi cian with payment made to the employing physician. Medicaid will not make payment to the PA or CRNP. Generally, CRNPs and PAs are reimburs ed at 80% of the allowed amount for all services except lab and inje ctables, which should pay at 100%. The employing physician must be a Medicaid provider in active status. The PA or CRNP must enroll with Medicaid and receive an Alabama Medicaid provider number with the employing physician as the payee. Covered services furnished by the PA or CRNP must be billed under the PA’s or CRNP’s name and Alabama Medicaid provider number. The covered services for PAs and CRNPs are limited to injectable drugs, laboratory services in which the laborat ory is CLIA certified to perform, and the CPT codes identified in A ppendix O, CRNP & PA Services.

A new patient office visit codes shall not be paid to the same physician or same group practice for a recipient more than once in a three-year period. 2.5 Physician Services to Hospital Inpatients In addition to the 14 physician visits, Medicaid covers up to 16 inpatient dates of service per physician, per recipient, per calendar year. For purposes of this limitation, each specialty within a group or partnership is considered a single provider. When filing claims for recipients enrolled in the Patient 1st Program, please refer to Chapter 39, Patient 1st, to determine whether your services require a referral from the Primary Medical Provider (PMP).

Physician 28-14 October 2005 Physician hospital visits are limited to one visit per day, per recipient, per provider. Physician(s) may bill for inpatient prof essional interpretation(s), when that interpretation serves as the official and final report documented in the patient’s medical record. Professio nal interpretation may be billed in addition to a hospital visit if the rounding physician also is responsible for the documentation of the final report for the procedure in the patient’s medical record. Professional interpretation may not be billed in addition to hospital visits if the provider reviews results in the medical record or unofficially interprets medical, laborat ory, or radiology tests. Review and interpretation of such tests and resu lts are included in the evaluation and management of the inpatient. Medicaid will cover either one hospital visit or professional interpretation(s) up to the allowed benefit limit for most services. Professional interpretations are allowed in the inpatient setting for the following services: Echocardiography (i.e., M-mode, tran sthoracic, complete and follow up) Echocardiography (i.e., 2D, transesophageal) Echocardiography (i.e., Doppler pulsed or continuous wave with spectral display, complete and follow up) Cardiac Catheterizations Comprehensive electrophysiologic evaluations and follow up testing Programmed stimulation and pacing Intra-operative epicardial and endocardial pacing and mapping Intracardiac catheter ablations; intracardiac echocardiography Evaluation of cardiovascular function Plethysmography, total body and tracing Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring Cerebrovascular arterial studies, extrem ity arterial studies, venous studies, and visceral and penile studies Circardian respiratory pattern recording (i.e., pediatric pneumogram), infant Needle electromyography Ischemic limb exercise test Assessment of aphasia Developmental testing Neurobehavioral status exam and ne uropsychological testing battery

Physician 28 October 2005 28-15 Professional interpretations for lab and x-ray (CPT code 70000 through 80000 services) in the inpatient setti ng can only be billed by pathologists and radiologists. The only exception is for professional interpretations by cardiologists for catheterization or arterial studies and for select laboratory procedures by oncologists and hematologists. Professional interpretations/components done by other physicians for services in this procedure code range are included in the hospital visit if one is done. If no hospital visit is made, professional interpretation by physicians other than radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, hematologists, and cardiologists should not be billed as these services are covered only for the above-mentioned specialties. A physician hospital visit and hospit al discharge shall not be paid to the same physician on the same day. If both are billed, only the discharge shall be paid. Professional interpretations performed for an inpatient are counted by dates of service rather than the number of interpretation performed. An office visit and an inpatient visit shall not be paid to the same physician on the same day. If both are billed, then the first Procedure Code billed will be paid. Physician consults are limited to one per day per recipient. 2.6 Critical Care When caring for a critically ill patient, fo r whom the constant attention of the physician is required, the appropriat e critical care procedure code (99291 and 99292) must be billed. Critical care guidelines are defined in the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Provider Manual. Critical care is considered a daily global inclusive of all services directly related to critical care. These codes can only be billed for a recipient age 25 months and older. Coverage of critical care may total no more than four hours per day. The actual time period spent in attendance at the patient's bedside or performing duties specifically related to that patient, irrespective of breaks in attendance, must be documented in the patient's medical record. RESTRICTIONS: No individual procedures related to critical care may be billed in addition to procedure codes 99291 and 99292, except: • An EPSDT screening may be billed in lieu of the initial hospital care (P/C 99221, 99222, or 99223). If screening is billed, the initial hospital care cannot be billed. • Procedure code 99082 (transportation or escort of patient) may also be billed with critical care (99291 and/or 99292). Only the attending physician may bill this service and critical care. Residents or nur ses who escort a patient may not bill either service.

--- Page 15 ---
Physician 28-16 October 2005 LIMITATIONS: • Procedure codes 99291 and 99292 may be billed by the physician providing the care of the critically ill or injured patient in place of service 41, Ambulance, if care is personally rendered by the physician providin g the care of the critically ill or injured patient. 2.7 Pediatric and Ne onatal Critical Care CPT Code Description Criteria 99293 Initial Inpatient Pediatric Critical Care, per day, for the evaluation and management of a critically ill infant or young child, 29 days through 24 months of age Not valid for ages 28 days or less, can be billed by any physician provider type 99294 Subsequent Inpatient Pediatric Critical Care per day, for the evaluation and management of a critically ill infant or young child, 29 days through 24 months of age. Not valid for ages 28 days or less, can be billed by any physician provider type 99295 Initial Inpatient Neonatal Critical Care, per day for the evaluation and management of a critically ill neonate, 28 days of age or less Not valid for ages 29 days or older, can be billed by any physician provider type 99296 Subsequent Inpatient Neonatal Critical Care, per day for the evaluation and management of a critically ill neonate, 28 days of age or less Not valid for ages 29 days or older, can be billed by any physician provider type The pediatric and neonatal critical ca re codes (99293-99296) include management, monitoring and treatment of the patient, including respiratory, pharmacological control of the circulatory system, enteral and parenteral nutrition, metabolic and hematologic maintenance, parent/family counseling, case management services and personal direct supervision of the health care team in the performance of their daily activities. Routinely these codes may include any of the following services, therefore these services should not be billed separately from the critical care codes 99293-99296: umbilical venous or umbilical arterial catheters, central or peripheral vessel catheterization, other arterial catheters, oral or nasal gastric tube placement, endotracheal intubation, lumbar puncture, suprapubic bladder aspiration, bladder catheterization, initiation and management of mechanical ventilation or CPAP, surfactant administration, intravascular fluid administration, transfusion of blood components (excluding exchange transfusions), vascular puncture, invasive or non- invasive electronic monitoring of vital signs, beside pulmonary function testing, and/or monitoring or interpretation of blood gases or oxygen saturation.

--- Page 16 ---
Physician 28 October 2005 28-17 The following criteria should be used as guidelines for the correct reporting of neonatal and pediatric critical care codes for the critically ill neonate/infant. Only one criterion is requir ed to be classified as critically ill. • Respiratory support by ventilator or CPAP • Nitric oxide or ECMO • Prostaglandin, Indotropin of Chronotropic or Insulin infusions • NPO with IV fluids • Acute Dialysis (renal or peritoneal) • Weight less than 1,250 grams • Acute respiratory distress in a pediatric admission requiring oxygen therapy with at least daily adjustment and FIO2>35% oxygen by oxyhood. RESTRICTIONS: No individual procedures related to critical care may be billed in addition to procedure codes 99293-99296 except: • Chest tube placement • Pericardiocentesis or thoacentesis • Intracranial taps • Initial hospital care history and physical or EPSDT screen may be billed in conjunction with 99295. Both may not be billed. NOTE: One EPSDT screen for the hospitalization will encompass all diagnoses identified during the hospi tal stay for referral purposes. • Standby (99360), resuscitation (994 40), or attendance at delivery (99436) may be billed in addition to critical care. Only one of these codes may be billed in addition to neonatal intensive care critical care codes. LIMITATIONS: • Code 99293 (initial inpatient pediatric critical care) is reported for the initial evaluation and management on the first day for infants 29 days through 24 months of age. • Code 99294 (subsequent inpatient pediatric critical care) is reported for subsequent days (p er day) for infants 29 days through 24 months of age. • Code 99295 (initial inpatient neonatal critical care) is reported for subsequent days (per day) for neonates, 28 days of age or less.

--- Page 17 ---
Physician 28-18 October 2005 • Code 99296 (subsequent inpatient neonatal critical care) is reported for subsequent days (p er day) for neonates, 28 days of age or less. • Pediatric, neonatal critical care codes and intensive (non-critical) low birth weight service codes are reported once per day per recipient. • Subsequent Hospital Care codes (99231-99233) cannot be billed on the same date of service as neonatal critical care codes (99293-99296) • Only one unit of critical care can be billed per child per day in the same facility. Medicaid pays the first claim received and denies subsequent claims (first in, first out policy). • Critical care is considered to be an evaluation and management service. Although usually furnished in a critical or intensive care unit, critical care may be provided in any inpatient health care setting. Services provided which do not meet critical care criteria, should be billed under the appropriate hospital care codes. If a recipient is readmitted to the NI CU/ICU, the provider must be the primary physician in order for NICU critical care codes to be billed again. • Once the patient is no longer considered by the attending physician to be critical, the S ubsequent Hospital Care codes (99231-99233) should be billed. Only one unit can be billed per day per physician regardless of specialty. Medicaid pays the first claim received and denies subsequent claims (first in, first out policy). • Transfers to the pediatric unit fr om the NICU cannot be billed using critical care codes. Subsequent ho spital care would be billed in these instances. • Global payments encompass all care and procedures that are included in the rate. Provider s may not perform an EPSDT screen and refer to a partner or other physician to do procedures. All procedures that are included in the daily critical care rate, regardless of who performed them, are included in the global critical care code. • Consultant care rendered to children for which the provider is not the primary attending physician must be billed using consultation codes. Appropriate procedures may be billed in addition to consultations. If, after the consul tation the provider assumes total responsibility for care, critical care may be billed using the appropriate critical care codes as defined above. The medical record must clearly indicate that the provider is assuming total responsibility for care of the pat ient and is the primary attending physician for the patient.

Physician 28 October 2005 28-19 28.2.8 Intensive (Non-Crit ical) Low Birth Weight Services CPT Code Description Criteria 99298 Subsequent intensive care, per day, for the evaluation and management of the recovering very low birth May only be billed by a neonatologist 99299 Subsequent intensive care, per day, for the evaluation and management of the recovering very low birth weight infant (present body weight of 1500-2500 grams) May only be billed by a neonatologist These codes are used to report care subsequent to the day of admission provided by a neonatologist directing th e continuing intensive care of the very low birthweight infant who no longer meets the definition of being critically ill. Low birthweight servic es are reported for neonates less than 2500 grams who do not meet the definiti on of critical care but continue to require intensive observation and frequent services and intervention only available in an intensive care setting. Services provided to these infants exceed those available in less intens ive hospital areas of medical floors. These infants require intensive cardiac and respiratory monitoring, continuous and/or frequent vital signs monitoring, heat maintenance, enteral and/or parenteral nutritional adjustments, laboratory and oxygen monitoring and constant observation by the health care team under direct supervision. RESTRICTIONS: No individual procedures related to critical care may be billed in addition to procedure codes 99298-99299 except: • Chest tube placement • Pericardiocentesis or thoracentesis • Intracranial taps LIMITATIONS: • Once the patient is no longer considered by the attending physician to be critical, the S ubsequent Hospital Care codes (99231-99233) should be billed. Only one unit can be billed per day per physician regardless of specialty. Medicaid pays the first claim received and denies subsequent claims (first in, first out policy). • Global payments encompass all care and procedures that are included in the rate. Provider s may not perform an EPSDT screen and refer to a partner or other physician to do procedures. All procedures that are included in the daily critical care rate, regardless of who performed them, are included in the global critical care code.

--- Page 19 ---
Physician 28-20 October 2005 • Consultant care rendered to children for which the provider is not the primary attending physician must be billed using consultation codes. Appropriate procedures may be billed in addition to consultations. If, after the consul tation the provider assumes total responsibility for care, critical care may be billed using the appropriate critical care codes as per the setting. The medical record must clearly indicate that the provider is assuming total responsibility for care of the pat ient and is the primary attending physician for the patient. • Pediatric, neonatal critical care codes and intensive (non-critical) low birth weight services codes are only reported once per day per recipient. 2.9 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Physician services rendered to each outpatient maintenance dialysis patient provided during a full month shall be billed on a monthly capitation basis using the appropriate procedure code by age as outlined in the CPT. Monthly maintenance dialysis payment (i.e., uninterrupted maintenance dialysis) is comprehensive and covers most of a physician’s services whether a patient dialyzes at hom e or in an approved ESRD outpatient facility. Dialysis procedures are allowed in addition to the monthly maintenance dialysis payment. In general, the Agency follows Medicare guidelines related to monthly capitation payments for physicians. Physician services included in the monthly capitation payment for ESRD related services include, but are not limited to: • Assessment and determination of the need for outpatient chronic dialysis therapy • Assessment and determination of the type of dialysis access and dialyzing cycle, • Management of the dialysis visits including outpatient visits for evaluation and management, management during the dialysis, and telephone calls. • Assessment and determination if a recipient meets preliminary criteria as a renal transplant candidate including discussions with family members • Assessment for a specified diet and nutritional supplementation for the control of chronic renal failure, including specifying quantity of total protein, sodium, potassium, amount of fluids, types of anemia and appropriate treatments, type of arthropathy or neuropathy and appropriate treatment or referral, estimated ideal dry weight, etc. Assessment for diabetic patient’s diet and caloric intake is included also. • Prescribing the parameters of intradialytic management including anticoagulant, dialysis blood flow rates and temperature, duration and frequency of treatments, etc. The monthly capitation payment is limited to once per month, per recipient, per provider.

--- Page 20 ---
Physician 28 October 2005 28-21 The following services are not cover ed by the monthly capitation payment (MCP) for the attending dialysis physicians and are reimbursed in accordance with usual and customary charge rules: • Declotting of shunts • Covered physician services furnished to hospital inpatients by a physician who elects not to receive the MCP for these service, For example, an attending physici an who provides evaluation and management (E & M) services for a renal patient in an inpatient setting may bill appropriate CPT hemodialysis procedures in lieu of certain other E & M services for ipatient visits. • Nonrenal related physician servic es furnished by the physician providing renal care or by another physician. (These services may not be incidental to services furnished during a dialysis session or office visit necessitated by the renal condition.) For example, physician services rendered to hospitalized inpatient recipients who require dialysis but are not receiving di alysis on that day may use the appropriate procedure code as described in the CPT. Physician services are allowed for outp atient maintenance dialysis patients not performed as prescribed during a full month or interruptedly. An example of interrupted monthly outpatient dialysis maintenance is preceding and/or following the period of hospitalization. The CPT codes described by age for physicians rendering outpatient dialysis services that are interrupted during a full month should be billed on a per day basis. These codes should be billed for the days of the month in which the outpatient ESRD related services were performed. Single or repeated physician assessments are allowed for hemodialysis or dialysis procedures other than hemodialysis. These services are comprehensive and include assessment and management related to the patient’s renal dialysis. Please utili ze the most descriptive and appropriate CPT dialysis procedure when billing for single or repeated physician evaluation(s). Dialysis training is a covered se rvice when billed by an approved ESRD facility. Refer to Chapter 35, Renal Dialys is Facility, for further details. Parenteral Nutrition The Alabama Medicaid Agency may reimburse for total parenteral nutritional (TPN) solutions through the pharmacy program if the recipient meets certain requirements as listed be low. TPN solutions include those used for hyperalimentation, intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN), and intraperitoneal nutrition (IPN). Requirements must be met and clearly documented in the medical record for coverage of all TPN. All services rendered are subject to post payment review. Added: Parenteral Nutrition

Physician 28-22 October 2005 Statement of Medical Necessity The ordering physician will be responsi ble for writing a statement of medical necessity. This statement shal l certify that the patient cannot be maintained on oral or enteral feedings and that due to severe pathology of the alimentary tract either hyperaliment ation or IDPN/IPN must be given for 100% of nutritional needs. The orig inal signed statement of medical necessity must be kept in the patient’s medical record. This certification statement must be written or stamped on the prescription or reproduced on a form accompanying the prescription. The statement must be signed and dated by the certifying physician at the time of each order. Hyperalimentation Medicaid covers hyperalimentation for recipients who meet certain requirements of medical necessity and documentation in the medical record is sufficient based on the following: • Documentation in the medical record must validate the patient suffers from a permanently impaired gastroin testinal tract and that there is insufficient absorption of nutrients to maintain adequate strength and weight. The following are considered conditions which could cause insufficient absorption: Crohn’s disease Obstruction secondary to strict ure or neoplasm of the esophagus or stomach Loss of ability to swallow due to central nervous system disorder, where the risk of aspiration is great Short bowel syndrome secondary to massive small bowel resection Malabsorption due to enterocolic, enterovesical or enterocutaneous fistulas (TPN temporary until the repair of the fistula) Motility disorder (pseudo-obs truction) Prolonged paralytic ileus following a major surgical procedure or multiple injuries Newborn infants with catastrophic gastrointestinal anomalies such as tracheoesophageal fistulas, gastroschisis, omphalocele or massive intestinal atresia Infants and young children who fail to thrive due to systemic disease or secondary to insufficiency associated with short bowel syndrome, malabsorption or chronic idiopathic diarrhea. • Medical record documentation must include supporting evidence that the patient cannot be maintained on oral or enteral feedings and that due to severe pathology of the alim entary tract, hyperalimentation must be given in order to meet 100% of the patient’s nutritional needs. Added: Statement of Medical Necessity Added: Hyperalimentation section

--- Page 22 ---
Physician 28 October 2005 28-23 • Physical signs, symptoms and test results indicating severe pathology of the alimentary tract must be clearly documented in the medical record. This would include BUN, serum albumin, and phosphorus. Medical records must do cument inability to maintain weight during a trial of at least four weeks of enteral feeding. Intradialytic Parenteral Nutrition (I DPN) and Intraperitoneal Nutrition (IPN) IDPN and IPN involves infusing hyperalim entation fluids as part of dialysis, through the vascular shunt or intraperitoneally to normalize the amounts of albumin, glucose, and other nutrients in the blood stream to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with protein calorie malnutrition. IDPN and IPN solutions are considered not covered for the recipient with a functioning gastrointestinal tract whose need for parenteral nutrition is only due to the following: • If IDPN or IPN is offered as an addition to regularly scheduled infusions of TPN • If the recipient would not qualify as a candidate for TPN • A swallowing disorder • A temporary defect in gastric emptying such as a metabolic or electrolyte disorder • A psychological disorder, such as depression, impairing food intake • A metabolic disorder inducing anorexia, such as cancer • A physical disorder impairing food intake, such as dyspnea or severe pulmonary or cardiac disease • A side effect of medication • Renal failure and/or dialysis The following requirements must be met in order to bill for IDPN or IPN solutions: • Documentation in the medical record must validate the patient suffers from a permanently impaired gastroin testinal tract and that there is insufficient absorption of nutrients to maintain adequate strength and weight. • Documentation must include that the patient cannot be maintained on oral or enteral feedings and that due to severe pathology of the alimentary tract, IDPN or IPN must be given in order to meet 100% of the patient’s nutritional needs. Added: Physical signs, symptoms…of enteral feeding Added: Intradialytic Parenteral Nutrition (IDPN) and Intraperitoneal Nutrition (IPN) section

--- Page 23 ---
Physician 28-24 October 2005 • Infusions must be vital to the nutriti onal status of the recipient and not supplemental to a deficient diet or deficiencies caused by dialysis. • Physical signs, symptoms and test results indicating severe pathology of the alimentary tract must be clearly documented in the medical record. This would include creatinine (predialysis), serum albumin (predialysis), a low or declining serum cholesterol level, and phosphorus. Medical re cords must docu ment inability to maintain weight during a trial of at leas t four weeks of enteral feeding. Restrictions A few solutions used in TPN preparation are considered payable as part of the composite rate for dialysis and sh ould not be billed separately by the pharmacist; these are as follows: • Glucose • Dextrose • Trace Elements • Multivitamins 2.10 Anesthesiology Administration of anesthesia is a covered service when administered by or directed by a duly licensed physician for a medical procedure that is covered by Medicaid. Medical direction by an anesthesiologist of more than four Certified Registered Nurse Anesth etists (CRNAs) or Anesthesiology Assistants (AAs) concurrent ly will not be covered. Administration of anesthesia by an AA is a covered service when the AA has met the qualifications and standards set forth in Rule No. 540-X-7-.34 of the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners. The AA must enroll and receive a provider number to bill the Alabama Medicaid Program. Refer to Chapter 38, Anesthesiology, for more information. 2.11 Obstetrical and Related Services The following policy refers to matern ity care billed as fee-for-service and not as a part of the Maternity Care program. Refer to Chapter 24, Maternity Care Program, for more details. Physician visits for obstetrical care are counted as part of each recipient's benefit limit of 14 physician visits per year under the conditions listed below. Maternity Care and Delivery The services normally provided in maternity cases include antepartum care, delivery, and postpartum care. When a physician provides total obstetrical care, the procedure code which shall be filed on the claim form is the code for all-inclusive "global" care. The indicated date of service on "global" claims should be the date of del ivery. If a woman is pregnant at the time she becomes eligible for Medi caid benefits, only those services provided during the time she is eligible will be covered. Added: Restrictions Added: Infusions must be…caused by dialysis. Added: Physical signs, symptoms and… of enteral feeding.

--- Page 24 ---
Physician 28 October 2005 28-25 NOTE : When a physician provides eight (8) or more prenatal visits, performs the delivery, and provides the pos tpartum care, the physician must use a "global" obstetrical code in billing. If a physician submits a "global" fee for maternity care and delivery, the visits covered by these codes are not counted against the recipient's limit of 14 physician office visits a calendar year. For purposes of "global" obstetrical billing, services rendered by members of a group practice are to be considered as services r endered by a single provider. NOTE : The date of service on the “globa l” OB claim must be the date of delivery. Antepartum care includes all usual prenatal services such as initial office visit at which time pregnancy is diagno sed, initial and subsequent histories, physical examinations, blood pressure recordings, fetal heart tones, maternity counseling, etc.; therefore, additional claims for routine services should not be filed. Antepartum care also includes routine lab work (e.g., hemoglobin, hematocrit, chemical urinal ysis, etc.); therefore, additional claims for routine lab work should not be filed. To justify billing for global antepartum care services, physicians must utilize the CPT-4 antepartum care global codes (either 4-6 visits or 7 or more visits), as appropriate. Claims for ant epartum care filed in this manner do not count against the recipient's limit of 14 office visits per year. NOTE : Physicians who provide less than four (4) visits for antepartum care must utilize CPT-4 codes under office medical services when billing for these services. These office visit codes will be counted against the recipient's limit of 14 physician visits a calendar year. Billing for antepartum care services in addition to "global" care is not permissible. However, in cases of pregnancy complicated by toxemia, cardiac problems, diabetes, neurologi cal problems or other conditions requiring additional or unusual services or hospitalization, claims for additional services may be filed. If t he physician bills fragmented services in any case other than high-risk or complicated pregnancy and then bills a "global" code, the fragmented codes shall be recouped. Claims for such services involved in complicated or high risk pregnancies may be filed utilizing CPT codes for Office Medical Services. Claims for services involving complicated or high-risk pregnancies must indicate a diagnosis other than normal pregnancy and must be for services provided outside of scheduled antepartum visits. These claims for services shall be applied against the recipient's limit of 14 physician office visits a calendar year.

--- Page 25 ---
Physician 28-26 October 2005 Delivery and Postpartum Care Delivery shall include vaginal deliver y (with or without episiotomy) or cesarean section delivery and all in-hospital postpartum care. More than one delivery fee may not be billed for a mu ltiple birth (twins, triplets, etc.) delivery, regardless of delivery method(s). Delivery fees include all professional services related to the hospitalization and delivery which are provided by the physician; therefore, additional claims for physician's services in the hospital such as hospital admission, may not be filed in addition to a claim for delivery or a claim for "global" care. EXCEPTION: When a physician's first and only encounter with the recipient is for delivery ("walk-in" patient) he may bill for a hospital admission (history and physical) in addition to delivery charges. Postpartum care includes office visits following vaginal or cesarean section delivery for routine postpartum care wi thin 62 days post delivery. Additional claims for routine visits during this time should not be filed. Delivery Only If the physician performs the delivery only, he must utilize the appropriate CPT-4 delivery only code (vaginal deliver y only or C-section delivery only). More than one delivery fee may not be billed for a multiple birth (twins, triplets, etc.) delivery, regardless of the delivery method(s). Delivery fees include all professional services re lated to the hospitalization and delivery which are provided by the physician; therefore, additional claims for physician's services in the hospital such as hospital admission, may not be filed in addition to a claim for delivery only. EXCEPTION: When a physician's first and only encounter with the recipient is for delivery ("walk-in" patient) he may bill for a hospital admission (history and physical) in addition to delivery charges. Ultrasounds Obstetrical ultrasounds are limited to two per pregnancy. For patients covered under the maternity care waiver, refer to Chapter 24, Maternity Care Program. Generally, first ultrasounds are conducted to detect gestational age, multiple pregnancies, and major malformations. Second ultrasounds may be conducted to detect fetal growth disorders (intrauterine growth retardation, macrosomia) and anomalies that would appear later or may have been unrecognizable in the earlier scan. Additional ultrasounds may be prior approved by the Alabama Medicaid Agency if a patient's documented me dical condition meets any of the following criteria: • Gestational diabetes with complications (Type 1 diabetes, vascular disease, hypertension, elevated alpha -fetoprotein values, poor patient compliance) • Failure to gain weight, evaluation of fetal growth • Pregnancy-induced hypertension • Vaginal bleeding of undetermined etiology • Coexisting adnexal mass • Abnormal amniotic fluid volume (polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios)

--- Page 26 ---
Physician 28 October 2005 28-27 • Pregnant trauma patient • Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) • Monitoring for special tests such as fetoscopy, amniocentesis, or cervical cerclage placement • Assist in operations performed on the fetus in the uterus • Detection of fetal abnormalities with other indicators or risk factors (Low human chronic gonadotrophin (HCG) and high-unconjugated estriol (uE3) are predictive of an increased risk for Trisomy 18. Echogenic bowel grades 2 and 3 are indicative of an increased risk of cystic fibrosis and Trisomy 21) • Determination of fetal presentation • Suspected multiple gestation, serial evaluation of fetal growth in multiple gestation • Suspected hydatidiform mole • Suspected fetal death • Suspected uterine abnormality • Suspected abrupt placenta • Follow-up evaluation of placental location for identified placenta previa • Maternity Care subcontractors shou ld contact the Primary Contractor for information regarding obstetrical ultrasounds. To determine if a procedure requires prior authorization, providers should use the AVRS line at EDS, 1-800-727-7848. 2.12 Vaccines For Children (VFC) The Department of Public Health provides vaccines at no charge to Medicaid providers enrolled in the Vaccines For Children (VFC) Program as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization. Medicaid reimburses administration fees for vaccines provided free of charge through the VFC Program. The rate for the administration fee is $8.00; it is not the rate on the pricing file. Please refer to Appendix A, Well Child Check-Up, Section A.6.1 (Fees) for information regarding the use of designated VFC codes for billing immunization administration fee(s). A VFC provider may or may not choo se to become an enrolled Medicaid provider. Enrollment as a VFC provider or a Medicaid provider is independent of each other. Refer to Appendix A, EPSDT, for procedure codes for VFC. 2.13 Lab Services Collection of laboratory specimens may be billed only when sending specimens to another site for analysis if the other site is not owned, operated, or financially associated with the site in which the specimen was collected. The collection fee may not be billed if the lab work is done at the same site where the specimen was collected or in a lab owned, operated, or financially associated with the site in which the specimen was collected.

--- Page 27 ---
Physician 28-28 October 2005 Providers will not be paid for and should not submit claims for laboratory work done for them by independent laboratories or by hospital laboratories. Providers may submit claims for laborato ry work done by them in their own offices or own laboratory facilities. Providers who send specimens to independent laboratories for analysis may bill a collection fee. This fee shall not be paid to any provider who has not actually extracted the specimen from the patient. NOTE : Providers should use procedure code 36415-90 for routine venipuncture collection, 36416-90 for collection of capillary blood specimen (e.g., finger, heal, ear stick) and Q0091-90 for collection of Pap smear specimen. Repeat Lab Procedures Modifier 91 may be utilized to denote a repeat clinical laboratory test performed on the dame date of service for the same recipient. Providers should use modifier 91 instead of modifier 76 for repeat lab procedures. NOTE : A physician CANNOT bill the following pathology/laboratory procedure codes, however the above collection fee can be billed, if applicable: 82775 Galactose – 1 – phosphate uridyl transferase; quantitative 83498 Hydroxyprogesterone, 17 – d 84030 Phenylalanine (PKU) blood 84437 Thyroxine; total requiring elution (e.g., neonatal) 2.14 Supply Code The procedure code 99070 is utilized by physicians to bill for supplies and materials over and above those usually included with the office visit. Examples of supplies and materials over and beyond usual supplies include elastic wraps, disposable tubing for bronchial dilating equipment or post-operative dressing changes when no office visit is allowable. 3 Prior Authorization and Referral Requirements Medical care and services that require prior authorization for in-state providers will continue to require pr ior authorization for out-of-state providers, e.g., organ transplants and select surgical procedures. Please refer to Chapter 4, Obtaining Prior Authorization for more information. Unlisted services and procedure code s are not covered by the Alabama Medicaid Agency, with the exception of Medicare crossover claims and rare instances when approval is granted prior to service provision after the agency has determined that the serv ice is covered and that no other procedure code exists for reimbursement. 4 Cost Sharing (Copayment) The copayment amount for physician office visit (including crossovers, and optometric) is $1.00 per visit. Copayment does not apply to services provided for pregnant women, nursing facility residents, recipients less than 18 years of age, emergencies, and family planning.

Physician 28 October 2005 28-29 The provider may not deny services to any eligible Medicaid recipient because of the recipient’s inability to pay the cost-s haring (copayment) amount imposed. 5 Completing the Claim Form To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Medicaid processing, providers should bill Medicaid claims electronically. Physicians who bill Medicaid cl aims electronically receive the following benefits: • Quicker claim processing turnaround • Immediate claim correction • Enhanced online adjustment functions • Improved access to e ligibility information Refer to Appendix B, Electronic Media Claims Guidelines, for more information about electronic filing. NOTE : When filing a claim on paper, a CMS-1500 claim form is required. Medicare-related claims must be filed using the Medical Medicaid/Medicare-related Claim Form. This section describes program-specific claims information. Refer to Chapter 5, Filing Claims, for general claims filing information and instructions. 5.1 Time Limit for Filing Claims Medicaid requires all claims for physicians to be filed within one year of the date of service. Refer to Section 5.1. 5, Filing Limits, for more information regarding timely filing limits and exceptions. 5.2 Diagnosis Codes The International Classification of Diseases - 9th Revision - Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) manual lists require d diagnosis codes. These manuals may be obtained by contacting the American Medical Association, P.O. Box 10950, Chicago, IL 60610. NOTE : ICD-9 diagnosis codes must be listed to the highest number of digits possible (3, 4, or 5 digits). Do not use decimal points in the diagnosis code field. ¾Electronic claims submission can save you time and money. The system alerts you to common errors and allows you to correct and resubmit claims online.

Physician 28-30 October 2005 5.3 Procedure Codes and Modifiers Medicaid uses the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). HCPCS is composed of the following: • American Medical Association’s Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) • Nationally assigned codes developed for Medicare • Locally assigned codes issued by M edicaid. Effective for dates of service on or after 01/01/2004, use national codes. Filing Claims with Modifiers Appropriate use of CPT and HCPCs modifiers is required to differentiate between sites and procedures. It is necessary to append the appropriate anatomical modifiers to surgical codes to differentiate between multiple surgeries and sites. Appropriate Use of Modifiers Modifier 59 (Distinct Procedural Service) According to the CPT book, modifier 59 is described as being necessary to describe a distinct procedural service. This modifier should only be used to show a distinct procedural serv ice when a comprehensive/component coding pair is billed. Modifier 59 should not be billed to represent that multiple services of the same procedure code were performed. A comprehensive/coding pair occurs when one code is considered a component procedure and the other code is considered a comprehensive procedure. These code pairs are frequently referred to as bundled codes thus meaning the component code is usually considered an integral part of the comprehensive code. Therefor e, in most instances the most comprehensive code only should be billed and the component code should be denied as rebundled or mutually exclusive. Modifier 59 should only be used in conjunction with a comprehensive/coding pair procedure when appropriately unbundling the code pair. This modifier 59 should not be billed with the comprehensive code. The component code can be unbundled, or allowed separately, in certain situations. If the two services are performed at two different times of day or the services are performed in two different anatomical sites, then modifier 59 can be submitted with the component procedure code. In order to communicate the special circumstances of the component/comprehensive code pair unbundling, diagnoses codes and anatomical modifiers must be utilized as appropriate on the claim form. In some cases, it may be necessary to a ttach a copy of the Operative Report to further explain the reason for the unbundling of code pairs. Modifier 59 should never be used in any other circumstances and is subject to post payment review. If t he services performed and billed for a date of service does not include a coding pair described above, then modifier 59 is not valid or appropriate.

Physician 28 October 2005 28-31 NOTE : Modifier 59 is not to be used with Physician's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 99201-99499 or 77419-77430 . Modifier 76 (Repeat Procedure) Prior to January 1, 2004, providers were advised to file multiple services with modifiers Y2-Y9 and Z2-Z3 to avoid services being denied as duplicates. Since these modifiers have been eliminated, we are revising instructions for filing multiple serv ices that are performed on the same day. . The appropriate use of CP T and HCPCS codes is required when filing claims. In addition, diagnosis codes and modifiers should assist with accurately describing services b illed. It is necessary to append the appropriate anatomical modifiers to procedure codes to differentiate between multiple sites. If a claim drops for manual review, the appropriate use of diagnosis codes and modifiers may assist claim reviewers in determining the intent of billing without having to request documentation. As always, providers can continue to file modifiers RT and LT when two of the same procedure is performed and one is on the right side and one is on the left side of the body. However, if more than one service is performed on the right or left side, services could be denied as duplicates if more than one RT or LT modifier is filed on the same procedure code. Modifier 76 is defin ed by the CPT as “Repeat Procedure by Same Physician”. Therefore, we are providing the following instructions to educate providers on how to submit those services. 1) If multiple services are performed, anatomical modifiers can be filed in addition to modifier 76 on the second line item. Anatomical modifiers are: LT, RT, E1-E4, F1-F9, FA, T1-T9, and TA. Date of Service Place Procedure Number of Services 2/4/03-2/4/03 11 73580-RT 1 2/4/03-2/4/03 11 73580-RT76 1 2) If multiple services are performed, anatomical modifiers can be used without modifier 76. Date of Service Place Procedure Number of Services 2/4/04-2/4/03 11 28820-T8 1 2/4/03-2/4/03 11 28820-TA 1 Multiple services (excluding most surg eries) can also be filed with multiple units of service. Modifier 76 is defined as “repeat procedure by same physician”. The Agency requires claims f iled with multiple units of service be submitted as shown below. 3) The first line must be submitted with only one unit of service and the second line with modifier 76 can show the additional number of services that were performed that day. Date of Service Place Procedure Number of Services 2/4/03-2/4/03 11 88305-TC 1 2/4/03-2/4/03 11 88305-TC76 3

Physician 28-32 October 2005 Modifier 50 (Bilateral Procedures) Modifier 50 represents a bilateral serv ice was performed. For example, if bilateral joint injections are administe red into the shoulders, the services should be filed as follows: Date of Service Place Procedure Number of Services 2/4/03-2/4/03 11 20610-50 1 There should be only one line item submitted with modifier 50, one unit of service and a submitted amount to cover both procedures. The modifier 50 instructs our system to pay for t he procedure with the highest allowed amount and half of the allowed amount for each subsequent procedure. Procedure Codes The CPT manual lists most procedure codes required by Medicaid. This manual may be obtained by contacting the Order Department, American Medical Association, 515 North Stat e Street, Chicago, IL 60610-9986. The (837) Professional electronic claim and the paper claim have been modified to accept up to four Procedure Code Modifiers. NOTE: Unlisted procedure codes are not co vered by the Agency unless the provider requested and received approval for a prior authorization before the service is rendered. The Agency will deny all requests for payment of unlisted codes after the fact. Physician-Employed Physician A ssistants (PA) and Certified Registered Nurse Practitioners (CRNP) Payment will be made only for physician drugs identified in Appendix H, Alabama Medicaid Physician Drug List, CPT codes identified in Appendix O, CRNP and PA Services, and laboratory services, which are CLIA certified. EPSDT screenings will be covered only if the provider is enrolled in that program. Refer to Appendix A, EPSD T, for EPSDT program requirements. The Physician's Assistant or CRNP can make physician required inpatient visits to nursing facilities. However, physician required inpatient visits to hospitals or other institutional setti ngs cannot be made by a PA or CRNP. Also, the PA or CRNP may provide low complexity or straightforward medical decision-making services in the emergency room or assist at surgery (identified surgical codes only) for Medicaid reimbursement. Surgical Procedure Codes Not Included in Global Surgical Package Certain relatively small surgical procedure codes formally designated in the CPT with an (*) may be billed in addition to an office visit. Additionally, these codes do not carry the global surg ical package concept of inclusion of post-operative care within 62 days of the surgery. In the 2004 CPT guidelines the (*) designation has been removed. For reference, these codes are listed below the covered services section in Chapter 28 of the Billing Manual.

Physician 28 October 2005 28-33 Surgical Procedure Code Modifiers When submitting claims for procedures done on the same date of service, a modifier is required to indicate that t he repeated service is not a duplicate. If the same provider performs the repeat procedure, use modifier 76. For repeat procedures done on t he same date of service by a different provider, use modifier 77. Claims submitted for repeat procedures on the same date of service without modifiers are denied as duplicate services. Modifier Description 76 Repeat Procedure By Same Physician. Modifier indicates a procedure of service is repeated by the same phy sician subsequent to the original service. This situation may be repor ted by adding modifier 76 to the five- digit procedure code. 77 Repeat Procedure By Another Physici an modifier indicates that a basic procedure performed by another physician had to be repeated. This situation may be reported by adding modifier 77 to the five-digit procedure code. 59 Distinct procedural service modifier indicates that a service or procedure was distinct or separate from other services performed on the same day. This may represent a different session or patient encounter, different procedure or surgery, different site, s eparate lesion, or separate injury (or area of injury in extensive injuries).

Physician 28 October 2005 28-35 Procedure Codes 32960 33010 33011 57500 57511 57800 Professional and Technical Components Some procedure codes in the 70000, 80000, 90000, and G series are a combination of a professional component and a technical component. Therefore, these codes may be billed one of three different ways; (1) as a global, (2) as a professional component, or (3) as a technical component. NOTE: Not all providers are allowed to bill any or all of the three ways to bill. Specific coverage questions should be addressed to the Provider Assistance Center. • Global , the provider must own the equipment, pay the technician, review the results, and provide a wr itten report of the findings. The procedure code is billed with no modifiers. The Global component should be billed only for the following place of service locations: − 11 (Office) − 81 (Independent Laboratory) • Professional component , the provider does not own or operate the equipment. The provider reviews the results, and provides a written report of the findings. The Radi ological professional component is billed by adding modifier 26 to the procedure code, and should be billed only for the following place of service locations: − 21 (inpatient hospital) − 22 (outpatient hospital) − 23 (emergency room - hospital) − 51 (inpatient psychiatric facility) − 61 (comprehensive inpatient rehab facility) − 62 (comprehensive outpat ient rehab facility) − 65 (end-stage renal disease facility) − 81 (Independent Laboratory) • Technical component , the provider must own the equipment, but does not review and document the results. The technical component charges are the facility’s charges and are not billed separately by physicians. The technical component is billed by adding modifier TC to the procedure code. The technical component can only be billed by facilities. 5.4 Billing for Patient 1st Referred Service Please refer to Chapter 39 for information regarding the Patient 1st Program and Patient 1st referrals. Please refer to Chapter 5, Filing Claims, for information regarding filing claims for a Patient 1st referral.

Physician 28 October 2005 28-37 Abortions In accordance with federal law, abortions are covered only (1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or (2) where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, phy sical injury, or physical illness, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed. Please refer to Appendix E, Medicaid Forms, for a copy of the PHY-96-2 Certification and Documentation for A bortion form, which is used when the pregnancy is causing the life of the mother to be in danger. In the case of abortions performed secondary to pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, the documentation required is a letter from the recipient or provider certifying that the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. • The original copy of the PHY-96-2 form (for life of the mother in danger) signed by the attending physi cian, or the certification letter regarding rape or incest, and a copy of the medical records (history and physical, operative report and discharge summary) must be submitted to EDS. • The second copy of the consent fo rm or certification letter must be placed in the recipient’s medical record. • Copies of the consent form or certification letter may need to be provided to hospital, laboratory or other providers as applicable in order for them to submit billing for their services. All claims relating to abortions must have the above-specified documentation on file at EDS prior to payment. This documentation is not required when a recipient presents with a spontaneous abortion. If the recipient does not qualify for paym ent by Medicaid and elects to have the abortion, providers may bill the recipient for the abortion as a non-covered service. Sterilization EDS must have on file the Medicaid-approved sterilization form. Refer to Appendix C, Family Planning, for more information. Sterilization by Hysterectomy Payment is not available for a hysterectomy if: It was performed solely for the purpo se of rendering an individual permanently incapable of reproducing If there was more than one purpose to the procedure, it would not have been performed but for the purpose of r endering the individual permanently incapable of reproducing Hysterectomy procedures performed fo r the sole purpose of rendering an individual incapable of reproducing are not covered under Medicaid. Hysterectomies done as a medical nece ssity as treatment of disease can be paid for by the Medicaid funds under the physician's program.

--- Page 37 ---
Physician 28-38 October 2005 NOTE : Sterilization performed for the sole purpose of re ndering a person permanently incapable of reproducing is not available to persons under twenty-one (21) years of age under the Medicaid Program. Refer to Appendix E, Medicaid Forms, for a sample of the sterilization form. Hysterectomy The hysterectomy consent form was recent ly revised. The form was revised to include a section for unusual circumstances. Now this form can be used by a physician to certify a patient was alr eady sterile when the hysterectomy was performed; a hysterectomy was perform ed under a life threatening situation; or a hysterectomy was performed under a period of retroactive Medicaid eligibility. In all of these circumstance s, medical records mu st be forwarded to EDS along with the hysterectomy consent form and claim(s) in order for a State review to be performed. NOTE : The doctor’s explanation to the patient that the operation will make her sterile and the doctor’s and recipient’s signature must precede the operation except in the ca se of medical emergency. It is also important to note that certain fields on the hysterectomy consent form are non-correctable. T he non-correctable fields include the recipient’s signature and date of signed informed consent, the provider’s signature and date of informed consent and the repr esentative’s signature and date of informed consent (if the recipient requires a representative to sign for them). If a non-correctable field is missing, contains invalid information or indicates the recipient/representative or physician sig ned after the date of surgery, EDS will deny the consent form. EDS must have on file a Medicaid- approved Hysterectomy Consent Form. The revised hysterectomy consent form (form # PHY-81243) becomes effective January 1, 2004. Instructions for completing the consent form will be on the back of the consent form. See Appendix E, Medicaid Forms, or visit our website for a sample copy of this form. Please note, only the surgeon should submit a hysterectomy consent form to EDS. All other providers should not requ est and submit copies of the consent form. Multiple copies slow down the consent form review and claims payment process. Exceptions That Do Not Require Consent If the following situations, the consent fo rm is not required. If consent is not required, the reason must be stated on the claim. The physician who performed the hyster ectomy certifies in writing that the patient was already sterile when the hysterectomy was performed; the cause of sterility must be stated in this written statement.

--- Page 38 ---
Physician 28 October 2005 28-39 2. The physician who performed the hyster ectomy certifies in writing that the hysterectomy was performed under a lif e-threatening emergency situation in which prior acknowledgement was not possible. This written statement must include a description of the nature of the emergency. The hysterectomy was performed dur ing a period of retroactive Medicaid eligibility, and the physician who perform ed the hysterectomy submits, in lieu of the consent form, a written statem ent certifying that the individual was informed before the operation that the hy sterectomy would make her sterile. NOTE : Medicaid payment cannot be made for any claims for services provided in connection with an abort ion, a sterilization procedure or a hysterectomy for medical reasons unless an approved consent form is on file. Please be aware consent for sterilization is different from consent for hysterectomy. See Appendix M, Medicaid Forms, for examples of each. 6 For More Information This section contains a cross-referenc e to other relevant sections in the manual.
