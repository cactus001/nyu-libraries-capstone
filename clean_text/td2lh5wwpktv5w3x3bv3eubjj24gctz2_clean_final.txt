Letters: Taxes, Environment, CSUS, etc. [Sacramento Bee] Story appeared in EDITORIALS section, Page B6 Dan Lungren, eco-champion I am writing to applaud Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Gold River, for his foresight and courage in supporting the restoration of Yosemite National Park's Hetch Hetchy Valley. In his March 30 commentary (&quot;It is time to restore Hetch Hetchy Valley&quot;), he demonstrated his foresight on this issue by stating &quot;the gift (of a restored Hetch Hetchy Valley) we would present to our children, grandchildren and the world would be priceless.&quot; And he demonstrated his courage by being the first and, so far, only member of the House of Representatives or Senate (Democrat or Republican) to state publicly his support for Hetch Hetchy's restoration. Two letters to the editor (&quot;Lungren's right on Hetch Hetchy,&quot; April 4, and &quot;The greening of Dan Lungren, April 6) suggested that people should be skeptical of Lungren's motives or chastise him for positions on other environmental issues. Years ago, when President Reagan's interior secretary, Don Hodel, supported Hetch Hetchy's restoration, similar statements were made. However, Dave Brower, one of the world's leading environmentalists and a member of the Sierra Club's board of directors, asked club leaders: &quot;Would they rather curse a man for his ... sins than reward him ... for his demonstrated virtue?&quot; Regarding Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley, let's reward Lungren for his &quot;demonstrated virtue.&quot; - Ron Good, Sonora Executive Director, Restore Hetch Hetchy 1 / 2
