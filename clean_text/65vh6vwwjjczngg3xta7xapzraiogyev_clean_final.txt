E22NE 3 The aviation authority for Italy, Ente Nazioonale per l’Aviazione Civile (ENAC) (formerly Registro Aeronautico Italiano) , originally type certificated this engine . The FAA validated this product under U.S. Ty pe Certificate Number E22NE. Effective September 28, 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EAS A) began oversight of this product on behalf of Italy. Import Requirements : To be considered eligible for installation on U.S. re gistered aircraft, each new engine to be exported to the United States with ENAC or EASA airworthiness approval shall have a Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) or EASA Form 1, Authorized Release Certificate. The JAA or EASA Form 1 should state that the engine conforms to the type design a pproved under the U.S. Type Certificate E22NE is in a condition for safe operation and has undergone a final operational check. NOTE 1. Engine ratings are based on calibrated te st stand performance under the following conditions: - Nominal output shaft speed of 2,006 rpm. - Static sea level standard conditions of 59°F (15°C) and 29.92 in.
