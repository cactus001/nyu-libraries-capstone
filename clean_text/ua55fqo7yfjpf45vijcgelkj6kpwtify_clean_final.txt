525 Environmental Protection Agency § 86.136–90 shall not be used to make this adjust- ment. Dynamometers using automatic control of preselectable power settings may be set anytime prior to the begin-ning of the emissions test. (h) The driving distance, as measured by counting the number of dynamom-eter roll or shaft revolutions, shall be determined for the transient cold start, stabilized cold start, and transient hot start phases of the test. The revolu-tions shall be measured on the same roll or shaft used for measuring the ve-hicle’s speed. (i) Four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive vehicles may be tested either in a four-wheel drive or a two-wheel drive mode of operation. In order to test in the two-wheel drive mode, four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive vehicles may have one set of drive wheels dis-engaged; four-wheel and all-wheel drive vehicles which can be shifted to a two- wheel mode by the driver may be test-ed in a two-wheel drive mode of oper-ation. [54 FR 14529, Apr. 11, 1989, as amended at 70 FR 72927, Dec. 8, 2005] § 86.135–94 Dynamometer procedure. Section 86.135–94 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.135–90. Where a paragraph in §86.135–90 is identical and applicable to §86.135–94, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ‘‘[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.135–90.’’ Where a cor-responding paragraph of §86.135–90 is not applicable, this is indicated by the statement ‘‘[Reserved].’’ (a) Overview. The dynamometer run consists of two tests, a ‘‘cold’’ start test, after a minimum 12-hour and a maximum 36-hour soak according to the provisions of §§86.132 and 86.133, and a ‘‘hot’’ start test following the ‘‘cold’’ start by 10 minutes. Engine startup (with all accessories turned off), oper-ation over the UDDS and engine shut-down make a complete cold start test. Engine startup and operation over the first 505 seconds of the driving schedule complete the hot start test. The ex-haust emissions are diluted with ambi-ent air in the dilution tunnel as shown in Figure B94–5 and Figure B94–6. A di-lution tunnel is not required for test-ing vehicles waived from the require-ment to measure particulates. Six par- ticulate samples are collected on fil-ters for weighing; the first sample plus backup is collected during the first 505 seconds of the cold start test; the sec-ond sample plus backup is collected during the remainder of the cold start test (including shutdown); the third sample plus backup is collected during the hot start test. Continuous propor-tional samples of gaseous emissions are collected for analysis during each test phase. For gasoline-fueled, natural gas- fueled and liquefied petroleum gas- fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, the com-posite samples collected in bags are analyzed for THC, CO, CO 2, CH 4and NO X. For petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles (optional for natural gas- fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehi- cles), THC is sampled and analyzed continuously according to the provi-sions of §86.110. Parallel samples of the dilution air are similarly analyzed for THC, CO, CO 2, CH 4and NO X. For nat- ural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled vehi-cles, bag samples are collected and analyzed for THC (if not sampled con-tinuously), CO, CO 2, CH 4and NO X. For methanol-fueled vehicles, methanol and formaldehyde samples are taken for both exhaust emissions and dilution air (a single dilution air formaldehyde sample, covering the total test period may be collected). Parallel bag samples of dilution air are analyzed for THC, CO, CO 2, CH 4and NO X. Methanol and formaldehyde samples may be omitted for 1990 through 1994 model years when a FID calibrated on methanol is used. (b)–(i) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.135–90.

Paragraph (a) of this section applies to Otto-cycle ve-hicles. (1) The engine shall be started ac- cording to the manufacturer’s rec-ommended starting procedures in the owner’s manual. The initial 20-second idle period shall begin when the engine starts.

526 40 CFR Ch. I (7–1–08 Edition) § 86.137–90 (2) Choke operation: (i) Vehicles equipped with automatic chokes shall be operated according to the manufac-turer’s operating instructions in the owner’s manual, including choke set-ting and ‘‘kick-down’’ from cold fast idle. (ii) Vehicles equipped with manual chokes shall be operated according to the manufacturer’s operating instruc-tions in the owner’s manual. (3) The transmission shall be placed in gear 15 seconds after the engine is started. If necessary, braking may be employed to keep the drive wheels from turning. (4) The operator may use the choke, accelerator pedal, etc., where necessary to keep the engine running. (5) If the manufacturer’s operating instructions in the owner’s manual do not specify a warm engine starting pro-cedure, the engine (automatic and manual-choke engines) shall be started by depressing the accelerator pedal about half way and cranking the en-gine until it starts. (b) Diesel vehicles. The engine shall be started according to the manufacturers recommended starting procedures in the owners manual. The initial 20-sec-ond idle period shall begin when the en-gine starts. The transmission shall be placed in gear 15 seconds after the en-gine is started. If necessary, braking may be employed to keep the drive wheels from turning. (c) If the vehicle does not start after the manufacturer’s recommended cranking time (or 10 continuous sec-onds in the absence of a manufacturer’s recommendation), cranking shall cease for the period recommended by the manufacturer (or 10 seconds in the ab-sence of a manufacturer’s rec-ommendation). This may be repeated for up to three start attempts. If the vehicle does not start after three at-tempts, the reason for failure to start shall be determined. The gas flow measuring device on the constant vol-ume sampler (usually a revolution counter) or CFV (and the hydrocarbon integrator and particulate sampling system when testing petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles and the particulate sampling system when testing meth-anol-fueled diesel vehicles, see §86.137) shall be turned off and the sampler se-lector valves, including the methanol sampler, placed in the ‘‘standby’’ posi-tion during this diagnostic period. In addition, either the CVS should be turned off, or the exhaust tube discon-nected from the tailpipe during the di-agnostic period. If failure to start is an operational error, the vehicle shall be rescheduled for testing from a cold start. (d) If the engine ‘‘false starts’’ the operator shall repeat the recommended starting procedure (such as resetting the choke, etc.). (e) Stalling. (1) If the engine stalls during an idle period, the engine shall be restarted immediately and the test continued. If the engine cannot be started soon enough to allow the vehi-cle to follow the next acceleration as prescribed, the driving schedule indi-cator shall be stopped. When the vehi-cle restarts, the driving schedule indi-cator shall be reactivated. (2) If the engine stalls during some operating mode other than idle, the driving schedule indicator shall be stopped, the vehicle shall then be re-started and accelerated to the speed re-quired at that point in the driving schedule and the test continued. Dur-ing acceleration to this point, shifting shall be performed in accordance with §86.128. (3) If the vehicle will not restart within one minute, the test shall be voided, the vehicle removed from the dynamometer, corrective action taken, and the vehicle rescheduled for test. The reason for the malfunction (if de-termined) and the corrective action taken shall be reported to the Adminis-trator. [54 FR 14530, Apr. 11, 1989, as amended at 58 FR 16042, Mar. 24, 1993; 59 FR 48510, Sept. 21, 1994] § 86.137–90 Dynamometer test run, gas- eous and particulate emissions. (a) General —(1) Gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles. The vehicle shall be allowed to stand with the engine turned off for a period of not less than 12 hours or more than 36 hours before the cold start exhaust emission test. The cold start exhaust test shall follow the diurnal breathing loss test by not more than one hour. The vehicle shall be stored prior to the VerDate Aug<31>2005 08:05 Aug 07, 2008 Jkt 214159 PO 00000 Frm 00536 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\214159.XXX 214159dwashington3 on PRODPC61 with CFR
