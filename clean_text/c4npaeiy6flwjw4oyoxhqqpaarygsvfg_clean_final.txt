Global Weather States (WS) derived through cluster analysis of ISCCP TAU -PC histograms: 11 WS going from deep convective to stratocumulus clouds Fair-weather WS7 most frequent one Separation of tropical and midlatitude convective clouds Tropical -subtropical region shows a stratocumulus -shallow cumulus -fair weather balance Tselioudis et al. 2013

Weather States in the Azores Fair-weather most frequent but significant amounts of shallow cumulus, stratocumulus, and storm clouds Fair-weather increases southward and storm clouds northward of the Azores grid box. Azores vs Global WS Lower fair -weather and deep convection frequency and higher frequency of shallow cumulus and stratocumulus clouds

Weather States in the GISS GCM Model severely overpredicts the fair - weather WS and underpredicts the low cloud WS Tropical convection is overpredicted in the model GISS GCM WS in the Azores Most GCM WS deficiencies in the global domain are present in the Azores analysis

The case of Nov. 22, 2009: WS11 at 12z, WS10 at 15z Model simulations using the GISS SCM and the Dharma LES

Summary Weather State analysis shows Azores to be a good lab to study major deficiencies in GISS GCM cloud property simulations Tools are in place to allow us to slide back and forth between global and local scale observations and model simulations. The strategy is to use case study SCM and LES simulations constrained by AMF observations to understand model deficiencies in simulating cloud processes and attribute them to forcing field inadequacies or parameterization problems, and then use the satellite and GCM analysis to understand the relevance of those deficiencies to the global model climate simulations.
