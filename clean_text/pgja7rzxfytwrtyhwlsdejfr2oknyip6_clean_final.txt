In 2009, EFNEP reached 147,043 adults and 444,875 youth directly and nearly 400,000 family members indirectly.DEFINING THE PROBLEM Obesity, poor nutrition, and limited physical activity are significant health concerns. Poor health disproportionately affects minority and low-income populations. Educational opportunities and resources are limited. INVESTING IN THE SOLUTION EFNEP brings together federal, state, and local resources to target two primary audiences: low-income families with young children and low-income youth. The program oper - ates in over 800 counties throughout the 50 states, 6 U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia. Each year, more than 500,000 new participants complete the program. .00 .01 .02.00.03 .00 .01.00 .00 .22.00.01 .01 .14.01 .01 .27.02.22 .02 .01Ethnicity not provided Hispanic or Latino Not Hispanic or Latino100% 30% 0%non-minority or not providedminorityREacHING LO w-INc OME F aMILIES 85% of EFNEP participants who reported income are at or below 100% of poverty, earning $22,050 a year or less for a family of four.REacHING DIVERSE POPULa TIONS At least 70% of all EFNEP adults are minorities. 85% of participants at or below poverty15% of participants above poverty up to 100% of poverty $22,050 for a family of 4up to 185% of poverty $40,793 for a family of 4 up to 75% of poverty $16,538 for a family of 4 up to 50% of poverty $11,025 for a family of 4 0%2,441 13,766 13,315 22,625 51,795 participants2009 impacts: THE ExP aNDED F OOD aND NUTRITION EDUca TION PROGRaM (EFNEP)www.nifa.usda.gov/efnep Multiple races identified american Indian or alaska Native Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanderafrican- american asian white Race not provided

wHY IT w ORk S EFNEP educators follow a research-based learning model that allows them to effectively reach and educate program participants. Educators are: • members of the communities they support; • trained/supervised by university and county- based faculty; • skilled in using hands-on, interactive teaching methods; • committed to delivering sound instruction; • able to influence changes in behavior and impact the lives of those they teach; and • dedicated to reaching diverse, low-income populations.DEMONSTRa TING RESULTS IMPROVEMENT IN FOOD GROUPS This graphic shows the difference between data reported through diet recalls for 93,196 adult EFNEP graduates and recommendations for females ages 19-30 who are moderately active less than 30 minutes per day.

For a community to be able to have a program like this… it’s certainly more valuable than I think anyone really understands.” EFNEP participant, Pennsylvania“ [EFNEP is] a tool that families and individu - als can use to better their lives … because when people ... learn together and cook together it sets off the first spark that’s needed for education to spread. EFNEP is the spark that’s needed in people’s lives and in communities.” EFNEP Paraprofessional, New Mexico“ If we teach people how to better shop for food and what to do with food… it helps decrease the number of people who go back to food pantries for assistance. It helps break that cycle of dependency… it’s an answer to help people in these economically troubling times.” EFNEP partner, St. Martin Center, PA cHaNGING aDULT BEHa VIORINFLUEN cING YOUTHUSDA is an equal opportunity provider and employer | June 2010 For more information, visit www.nifa.usda.gov/ efnep or contact sblake@nifa.usda.gov or hchipman@nifa.usda.gov95% 66% Percentage of adults improving diet, consuming an extra ⅔ cup of fruits and vegetablesPercentage of 83,314 youth now eating a variety of foodsdiet quality 83% 61% Percentage of adults bettering food resource management practicesPercentage of 89,823 youth increasing ability to select low-cost, nutritious foodsfood savings88% 66% Percentage of adults improving nutrition practicesPercentage of 115,879 youth increasing essential human nutrition knowledgenutrition 67% 57% Percentage of adults improving food safety practicesPercentage of 107,357 youth improving food safety and preparation practicesfood safety
