This paper reports on the next step in the BLISS development inwhich the fidelity of the aerodynamic drag and structural stress and displacement analyses were upgraded while the methodÕs satisfactory convergence rate was retained. Introduction BLISS, for Bi-Level Integrated System Synthesis, is an optimization method for engineering a modular system, e.g., an aerospace vehicle, in which it is beneficial to separate the design variables and constraints local to a module from those that govern the entire system. Suchseparation fosters development of a broad workfront ofpeople and computers, hence it fits well the current trends for massively parallel processing in computer technology and the co ncurrent engineering style of the workforce organization. The focus on dividing the optimization into the suboptimizations within each module (subsystem, also called the black box) and a coordinating optimization atthe system level places BLISS in the MultidisciplinaryDesign Optimization (MDO) toolbox, in the company of a few other methods that have the same focus as BLISS but differ in approach. Representative examples of these methods are the Collaborative Optimization

The distinguishing features of BLISS are the use of the system objective (e.g., the aircraft range) as the optimization objective in each of the subsystems and atthe system level, and coupling between the optimizations at the system and subsystem levels bythe optimum sensitivity derivatives with respect to parameters. The overall architecture of BLISS as a method does not depend on the fidelity of the analyses performed in each module. Consequently, in principle at least, BLISS may be used in any design phase from conceptual,through preliminary to detailed, provided thatappropriate level of analysis is implemented in the modules. The BLISS method was introduced in (Sobieszczanski- Sobieski et al, 1998a) and documented in detail in(Sobieszczanski-Sobieski et al, 1998b *). In the paper, that prototype is referred to as the original BLISS. In its original form BLISS modules were kept very simplecorresponding to the early conceptual design phase. Satisfactory results from the initial trials of BLISS on atest case of a business jet encouraged next step in the BLISS development - upgrading its structural analysis and aerodynamic drag analysis modules - and validatingon the same test case. This paper reports on the above BLISS upgrade and results of the testing that advance the methods toward becoming a tool suitable for practical applications. Thereport provides a synopsis of the BLISS method, describes the salient features of the two upgraded modules, presents satisfactory convergence results, and summarizes the BLISS development status and thefuture development direction.

BLISS is a method for optimization of engineering systems that separates the system-level optimization from potentially numerous autonomous subsystemoptimizations. As shown in Figure 1, it utilizes asystem architecture in which design and behavior variables are split into three categories. X-variables are those design variables optimized at the local level andare unique to each particular subsystem. Behavior variables that are output from one subsystem and input to another are designated Y, and the system-level design variables are specified as Z. System-level variables are those shared by at least two subsystems.

A linear approximation to the system objective (an element of Y) as a function of Z and X is established using theabove derivatives. That approximation is adopted asthe objective function in subdomain optimizations thatfollow next. In each subdomain (module, or black box), the Z and Y variables are frozen and an improvement in the objective function is sought by thelocal optimizations that use local X separately in each module. The frozen Z and Y are constant parameters in each module optimization and the module optimizationis followed by computation of the derivatives of theoptimum with respect to these parameters. The second step achieves improvement through the system-levelvariables Z and is linked to the first step by thederivatives of optimum with respect to parameters Z and Y. The derivatives are used to extrapolate each subdomain optimum as a function of Z and Y. Thefunctional relation Y=Y(Z) is approximated byextrapolation based on the system sensitivity analysis. These steps alternate until convergence. A flowchart ofthe method is shown in Figure 2. System Analysis and Update VariablesSubsystem1 Optimization and Optm. Senstvty.

In the original version of BLISS the modules shown generically in Fig. 2 are Propulsion, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Performance whose detailed input/output variables are identified later. The commondenominator of these modules was the extreme simplicity of analyses that employed closed-form expressions for input-to-output mapping. This was so because of the need to test the overall procedure organization and the two-level algorithm convergence at the initial development stage of a new method without being encumbered by long turn-around times in the modules. The next logical step in the BLISS development is to upgrade the fidelity of the modules while holding the overall procedure organization unchanged. Upgrades in the BLISS Structures and Aerodynamics Modules The modularity of BLISS permits replacing or adding black boxes to refine or alter the optimization and analysis tools in each modules allowing the engineer the flexibility to exercise his judgment. Having tools of different level of fidelity in the modules enables applications of BLISS in different design phases. The advanced BLISS method incorporates two new modulesthat can be used in lieu of previous black boxes. The structures module now can use the Equivalent Laminated Plate Solution (ELAPS, Giles, 1986) and the aerodynamics module can use a code called AWAVE (Harris, 1964) to perform wave drag analysis. Integration of ELAPS In the previous application example, BLISS employed a skin-stringer representation of the internal wing box bays. This model broke the wing down into a three bay wing box whose geometry varied with the taper ratio, wing sweep, thickness to chord ratio, wingspan,and aspect ratio, all manipulated as design variables in the system-level optimization. The displacements,e.g., the wing twist, and stresses, were computed using simple, thin-walled box-beam formulas (e.g., Bruhn, 1965) In the BLISS application shown herein, the level of accuracy in this module is raised by substituting the previous model with the Equivalent Laminated Plate

4 American Institute of Aeronautics and AstronauticsSolution (ELAPS) computer code. This code designed with preliminary design stage calculations in mind iscapable of modeling aircraft wing structures with multiple trapezoidal segments. The wing structure is represented as a plate whose stiffness is set equivalent to that of the original, built-up, structural box of thewing. ELAPS employs a set of displacement functionsdefined over each trapezoidal segment and made compatible in regard to translations and rotations at thesegment junctions. Minimization of the strain energy based on the Ritz method leads to equations from which to calculate static deflections and internal forces.The latter are then converted to stresses taking into account the details of the wing box built-up cross- section. The accuracy of the results of ELAPS has been found to be somewhat below that of finite element codes (Giles,1986) but the ELAPS input is much simpler and faster to develop. The computation time for an ELAPS model is more than an order of magnitude faster than that of an equivalent finite element model - animportant feature for a tool to be integrated into an optimization procedure. Integrated in BLISS, ELAPS receives its input from a pre-processor routine that generates an input file with the skin thickness, aspect ratio, taper ratio, thickness tochord ratio, sweep, reference area, and aircraft weight. The model used by ELAPS analyzes stress along thesame three bay wingbox configuration used as an example in the original application of BLISS. Each wingbox consists of the top and bottom sandwich panels of different thicknesses and sandwich webs identical in the front and rear of the wingbox. The front spar of the wing box is located at 10% of thechord length and the rear spar lies at 70% of the chord length.

ELAPS models such a built-up structure by representing each face and the core as separate elements linked in a common coordinate grid. 1 23 45 6L h ts2ts1 ts3ts2 ts3 ?t311 2233 4455 66L h ts2ts1 ts3ts2 ts3 ?t3 Figure 4: Wingbox Model As it was done in the original BLISS implementation, the aerodynamic loads are being generated within the structures module in the pre-processor to structural analysis. To calculate the lift loads on the wing, the pre-processor routine averages spanwise between an elliptical lift distribution and a linear distribution thatreflects the wing chord taper. The elliptical and taper ratio based lift distributions for the wing are each normalized to contain an area of unity as illustrated in Figure 5. The averaged, spanwise load distribution is multiplied by the lift required from the wing and distributed chordwise. The chordwise distribution is a typical supersonic one with the center of pressure located at 50% of the chord. The aerodynamic load distribution would be expected to be calculated by an aerodynamics module using a higher fidelity analysis, e.g., a computational fluid dynamics code. Thus, thepresent aerodynamic loads generation is merely a placeholder for a real aerodynamic loads analysis in a future BLISS upgrade. In summary, the structural module employs ELAPS to calculate the stresses in the wing box for the given configuration, lift distribution, and corresponding constraints. It also outputs the wing twist and weight and the objective function for the local optimization. The aerodynamics module accepts the output and models its influence on the aerodynamic response.

The original model (Sobieszczanski- Sobieski et al, 1998) used an approximation relying onthe span efficiency factor. That approximation was replaced herein with a code, AWAVE, that is a streamlined version of the far-field wave drag program (Harris, 1964). There are two versions of the Harris wave drag program in common use at LaRC. The original version, described in the reference, treats lifting surfaces as a series of 3-dimensional solid elements. Amuch faster but slightly less accurate version treats lifting surfaces as 2-dimensional panels with finite thicknesses. Due to compensating errors at positive and negative roll angles of the Mach cutting plane, the panel version gives excellent results for wave drag coefficients. The objective of the last (AWAVE) effort was to develop a version of the wave drag program withthe accuracy of the solid element program that is faster than the panel version. The AWAVE code implemented computes the wave drag on the basis of the aircraft cross-section distribution along the centerline, hence it requires data about the entire configuration geometry to enable the area ruling of supersonic body design. Similarly to the integration of ELAPS, integration of AWAVE was accomplished by creating a pre-processor to generate the necessary input. The input provides thecurrent designÕs aspect ratio, taper ratio, thickness to chord ratio, sweep angle, wing reference area, horizontaltail sweep angle, horizontal tail aspect ratio, and horizontal tail reference area. The pre-processor also creates and places the wing and tail airfoils according tothe design configuration variables. The AWAVE output is the wave drag coefficient to be added to the other drag components whose calculation remains thesame as in the original BLISS.Numerical Implementation Compared to the original application of BLISS to the supersonic business jet case, incorporation of ELAPS and AWAVE in BLISS required some changes to constraints and allocation of the design variables to thesystem and subsystem levels.

With the integrationof ELAPS and AWAVE, the taper ratio affects both the aerodynamics and structures module. While the aerodynamics module optimization may tend toward a taper ratio to reduce induced drag, the structures modulemay generate a different taper value to reduce stresses. To resolve this trade-off, the taper ratio was raised to a system variable, capable of influencing both modules. Figure 6 shows the current black box and variable interactions. In this model there are nine system-level Z-variables, each influencing a minimum of two of the subsystems.The local variables of each subsystem are manipulated only in the optimization local to that subsystem. Thepropulsion module has the throttle as its sole local variable. In the present state of BLISS, the range module is an exception as it performs no optimization. It only evaluates the Breguet range formula. The aerodynamics module optimizes the local variables of

The structural subsystem optimization operates on the sandwich face sheet and caliper thicknesses for the wingcover panels and the webs of the three wingbox bays. The ten Y-variables noted in the off-diagonal boxes in Figure 6, represent couplings of the black boxes and arecomputed in the system analysis. BLISS was originally implemented in MATLAB 5.3.0 at both the system and subsystem levels. TheMATLAB Optimization Toolbox was used as anoptimizer in the subsystem and system optimizations.In the version of BLISS reported herein, the use of MATLAB continued as above with the exception of thestructures and aerodynamics modules that incorporated ELAPS and AWAVE, both written in FORTRAN 77. MATLAB provides a facility to invoke FORTRAN from a MATLAB code. To exploit that facility, thepreprocessors to both ELAPS and AWAVE were written in FORTRAN and converted into MEX-Files using the MATLAB mex-function (Appendix). Both AWAVE and ELAPS were then directly called from within the BLISS modules. On the output side,simple post-processing generated outputs in a format acceptable to the parts of BLISS that remained being coded in MATLAB for further analysis. Because of the MATLAB ability to invoke FORTRAN codes, theBLISS upgrading process may continue by addingFORTRAN-coded modules wherever required while retaining the MATLAB core that executes the method logic illustrated by the flowchart in Fig. 1. Results BLISS iterations terminate when the change in the aircraft range objective varies less than ten nautical miles. This took seven passes through the flowchart in Figure 2. The system-level design variables converged within the first few passes. Further optimizations focused primarily on the local variables. Most of the changes occurred within the structures module where the new ELAPS-based optimization kept refining thevariables searching for the best solution. The majority of the computational time was spent in this module.Table 1 shows the variable progression through the optimization process. The table reflects the major trade-offs that occur between the wing sweep angle, airfoil thickness ratio, and the wing aspect ratio, all of which govern the structural weight and drag that, in turn, influence theva r \ c y c l e 1 2345678 Range (NM) 1051 4492 3938 3546 3399 2432 2493 2493 t1 (inner) 2 0.617 1.326 0.944 0.643 0.192 0.192 0.192 t1 (middle) 2 0.301 0.624 0.637 1.028 0.663 0.663 0.663 t1 (outer) 2 0.383 0.53 0.322 0.457 0.044 0.044 0.044 t2 (inner) 2 12 7.449 5.573 3.089 0.012 0.012 0.012 t2 (middle) 2 12 2.803 0.909 8.864 0.012 0.012 0.012 t2 (outer) 2 12 0.6 0.012 12 8.115 8.115 8.115 t3 (inner) 2 0.48 0.729 0.824 0.173 1.075 1.075 1.075 t3 (middle) 2 1.348 0.562 0.511 0.548 0.517 0.517 0.517 t3 (outer) 2 0.115 0.267 0.248 0.265 0.012 0.012 0.012 ts1 (inner) 4 0.617 1.325 0.944 1.985 2.205 2.205 2.205 ts1 (middle) 4 0.865 0.624 0.637 1.028 0.663 0.663 0.663 ts1 (outer) 4 0.383 0.53 0.322 0.617 0.233 0.233 0.233 ts2 (inner) 4 24 24 23.17 12.46 3.466 3.466 3.466 ts2 (middle) 4 24 0.464 0.665 23.02 14.31 14.31 14.31 ts2 (outer) 4 24 2.583 1.802 24 2.229 2.229 2.229 ts3 (inner) 4 0.48 0.37 0.677 0.177 1.076 1.076 1.076 ts3 (middle) 4 1.348 0.562 0.511 0.068 0.391 0.391 0.391 ts3 (outer) 4 0.115 0.267 0.248 0.38 0.251 0.251 0.251 L HT (¡) 60 70 70 70 40 40 40 40 LW (%MAC ) 1 011 2 1 111 LHT (%MAC) 250 350 350 100 350 100 100 100 T 0.35 0.319 0.236 0.241 0.255 0.281 0.31 0.31 t/c 0.05 0.058 0.058 0.058 0.058 0.058 0.058 0.058 h (ft) 55000 60000 60000 60000 60000 60000 60000 60000 M 1 . 822 2 2 222 ARW 4 2.5 2.607 2.607 2.607 2.607 2.607 2.607 LW (¡) 55 40 40.63 40.63 40.63 40.63 40.63 40.63 SREF (ft2) 400 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 SHT (ft2) 150 150 150 150 150 150 150 150 ARHT 6.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 8.5 lW 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Table 1: Supersonic Business Jet Results range. Ultimately, influences of these variables on the range differ in sign, therefore, the procedure seeks a compromise. For example, the wing sweep initially increases to approximately 70 degrees and then falls to 40 while the taper ratio decreases to 0.1. The wing reference area rapidly reduces to 200 square feet as the wing aspect ratio is brought down first to 2.5 and then increased to 2.607. The wing position is briefly changed in the fourth cycle but quickly returns to its initial value. The wing configuration progression isdepicted in Figure 7.

7 American Institute of Aeronautics and AstronauticsThe horizontal tail position and geometry stabilize after the main wing variables reach their settling points. Thetail position varies significantly but settles at a value of100 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord. The tail sweep ends up almost matching the wing sweep but hasa significantly larger aspect ratio. Further analysis of the tail may involve incorporating an ELAPS model ofthe tail to increase fidelity of analysis in that component. The skin thicknesses change throughout the process seeking the maximum of the structure contribution to the range under the stress constraints for the given configuration geometry, the latter governed by the Z- variables.

Figure 9 shows theprogression of the aircraft Take-Off Gross Weight and its components of empty weight and fuel. Figure 9: Aircraft WeightFigure 10 depicts a histogram of the aircraft range. It starts off at a feasible design point. The cycles two through five did not lie within the design space, butBLISS returned to the design space and settled on a feasible design with optimized range. The last implementation of BLISS to the supersonic business jet test case (Agte, 1999) yielded a range of 2,189 nautical miles. With the addition of AWAVE and ELAPS, the more refined analysis increased the range to 2,493 nautical miles. Distribution of elapsed computing time over the BLISS modules is displayed in Table 2. It is evident thatmost of the elapsed time is spent in ELAPS but that would change drastically if a CFD-level analysis were used in the aerodynamics module. If BLISS were grown to the point where all the major modules would consume about equal amount of the elapsed time, then distributed execution on concurrently operatingmachines (or processors within a multiprocessor machine) would radically compress the elapsed time of the entire BLISS execution. BLISS ELAPS AWAVE Percent of Time 8.36% 89.78% 1.87% Table 2: Processor Time Use The next step in the BLISS development is to incorporate additional modules to increase the analysis fidelity. The largest refinement would be expected from adding a computational fluid dynamics code to perform the aerodynamic analysis, including the loads. The propulsion data quality would benefit from replacing the current response surface fitted to a look-uptable with a comprehensive engine analysis. Also, the simple Breguet formula for the aircraft range would need to be replaced by a complete performance analysis Conclusions and Remarks Integration of ELAPS and AWAVE into BLISS demonstrated the modular nature of the method and its ability to accommodate refinements. Used in a limited test case of a supersonic business jet design, the two- level optimization in BLISS was effective in satisfying the system-level and local constraints while attaining asystem-level objective within a reasonable number of iterations. Separation of the system-level designvariables from the local ones enabled optimization for asystem-level objective while providing autonomy of thedesign decision and tool choice within disciplines represented in the modules.Aircr aft Total and Em pty Weight 12 0 0 014 0 0 016 0 0 018 0 0 020 0 0 022 0 0 024 0 0 026 0 0 028 0 0 030 0 0 0 123 456 78BLISS C ycle Numbe rWeight (lb)Total Weight Empty WeightFuel Weight

8 American Institute of Aeronautics and AstronauticsThe method is open to further upgrades in terms of the fidelity of analysis and optimization t echniques employed in the modules. In this regard, it is up to theuser to decide on the variety of tools to be integrated inBLISS as needed by the multidisciplinary optimizationtask at hand. Further advancement of BLISS from its present status of a method concept demonstrator to a tool useful inactual applications calls for inserting a CFD code in theaerodynamics module, adding a comprehensive engine analysis to the propulsion module, and extending theperformance analysis module to include more than just the cruise phase of a mission. Finally, as the increased fidelity of analyses in the modules will exact its price in terms of the computing elapsed time, concurrent execution of the modular analyses and optimizations will become an attractive option.

Appendix There are a few steps required for integrating a FORTRAN code into the MATLAB environment that BLISS is currently programmed in. The user must locate the place in BLISS where a c all is made to analysis that is to be replaced. Then he must ex amine the input and output of the new and old analysis to ensure that the remainder of BLISS is capable of supplying input the new analysis requires and that the new analysis produces all the output expected. Then a

9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics pre-processor routine must be created to present the variable information to the FORTRAN code in an appropriate format. Finally the data must be harvested and returned to the MATLAB module from which the FORTRAN code is being called in a format compatiblewith MATLAB. Pre-processing In pre-processing, BL ISS must pass the needed variables to a routine which will manipulate them into a form that the FORTRAN code will accept. The programmer must first ensure that the module in which he is pre-processing has access to the required variables (i.e., the subsystem must not be using X variables assigned to other subsystems). The two FORTRAN codes integrated required formatted text input files. The easiest way to prepare these files was to use a FORTRAN subroutine to take the design variables, configure them in the way needed to represent the geometry or conditions needed by the analysis, and write the formatted input file for analysis. In order to pass variables from the MATLAB environment to the FORTRAN pre-processing subroutine, MATLABÕs mex-function was invoked. Inthis function, a standard gateway subroutine is added tothe FORTRAN pre-processing subroutine. This new routine collects an array of variables passed in from MATLAB and assigns them to a FORTRAN array. The gateway routine sends these variables into the pre- processing subroutine. In MATLAB, the user compiles the FORTRAN code including the gateway routine and the pre-processing routine using the mex command. This creates a mex- file which is treated as a MATLAB function requiring an input array and an output array. The user then places his variables for the pre-processing function into an array and puts this array into the new mex-file. This sends the variables to the gateway routine which assigns them to the variables used in the FORTRAN pre-processing subroutine. The input file is generated and control returns to MATLAB. Program Insertion Having prepared the data for analysis by the program, the programmer must locate the section of BLISS that he wishes to upgrade. The previous analysis must beremoved and the code must be placed such that BLISS will have performed the new analysis and have data ready for later analysis that the user is not replacing. Having located the desired calling spot and removed the replaced analysis, the user simply calls the program from within BLISS. By previously compiling the FORTRAN code in question, the user calls the program by typing !program_name in the BLISS code where program_name is the command that runs the program from the operating system. The program then processesthe prepared input file and returns to BLISS. Data Collection The final step that the programmer must perform in order for BLISS to carry on its optimization is harvesting the data produced by the new program. ELAPS and AWAVE both created output files with data required for BLISS. There are two basic ways to collect data produced by FORTRAN codes. The first way is to use a post-processing technique similar to that of pre-processing. The user would create a search algorithm to locate and collect the data from the output file. This in turn would be harvested by using the mex-function to create a gateway between the FORTRAN data collection routine and the BLISS variables. The programmer would compile the mex- function gateway routine combined with his data collection routine, run the new mex-file with an array prepared to collect the output of the routine, and extract his data to the array. The programmer would then need to assign the array variables to the proper variables in the BLISS code. This technique would be best for cases where the user did not have access to the source code of the FORTRAN program. In cases where the programmer does have the FORTRAN programÕs source code and a fair knowledgeof how the program works, he can edit the code to output the needed results in a format compatible with MATLAB. If the user can locate the sections of code that write out the results to the output file, they canchange the code to output to a file with a .m extension.Files in this format are recognized as MATLAB programs that can be called without FORTRAN interaction. By creating .m files with MATLAB variable assignments corresponding to the data that theuser wishes to collect, the programmer simply runs these MATLAB files after completion of the main program call and the output is already in MATLAB format. This avoids unnecessary data file searching andreduces MATLAB-FORTRAN interaction. After the data are collected and assigned to the proper variables inBLISS, the analysis would then continue as normal.
