Broadband USA Applications Database Applicant Name: Dotnet Acquisition Company, LLC _______________________Public Notice Submissions_______________________ -----Service Area: Green Lake Underserved Submitter: Charter Communications Comment: Charter Communications (‘Charter’), a broadba nd service provider, has invested capital to provide a full range of Broadband services, including High Speed Internet services, in this service area. The applicant’s request in the proposed under-served service area would create an overlap in Charter’s service area. Charter’s response includes the necessary information to validate the overlapping condition as a result of this applicant’s request. Submitter: CenturyLink Comment: CenturyLink is submitting data that shows th e application’s proposed service area is not underserved or unserved, under program guidelines. Ac cordingly, the application must be denied as ineligible. With limited funding and a large pool of applications, program grants and loans must be directed only to areas that are truly underserved or unserved, as stipulated in the program guidelines. CenturyLink can certify that its affiliates currently offer broadband service in some or all of the applicant’s proposed service areas. Attached is a state map that is a representative sample of areas where the application overlaps our existing broadba nd deployment. CenturyLink also provides data showing broadband availability in our local telephone ex changes within the propos ed service areas. We will provide additional information on request if th at will further assist the agency’s review. This data is not exhaustive; the application may include other areas also currently served with broadband by other providers, which should be consid ered in the assessment of the application. Our data combined with that of other broadband providers would likely show further duplication and overlap of broadband services in the proposed service areas.
