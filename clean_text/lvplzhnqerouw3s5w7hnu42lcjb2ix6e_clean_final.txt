The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to Part 71 of the FederalAviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) toestablish Class E airspace area atSharon, PA. An RNAV Approach,Helicopter RNAV 262, has beendeveloped for Shenango-UMPC HorizonHospital Heliport, Sharon, PA.Controlled airspace extending upwardfrom 700 feet AGL is needed toaccommodate the SIAP. Class E airspacedesignations for airspace areasextending upward from 700 feet or moreabove the surface are published inParagraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9H,dated September 1, 2000, and effectiveSeptember 16, 2000, which isincorporated by reference in 14 CFR71.1. The Class E airspace designationlisted in this document would bepublished subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves anestablished body of technicalregulations for which frequent androutine amendments are necessary tokeep them operationally current.Therefore, this proposed regulation —(1) is not a ‘‘significant regulatory action ’’ under Executive order 12866; (2) is nota ‘‘significant rule ’’ under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3)does not warrant preparation of aregulatory evaluation as the anticipatedimpact is so minimal. Since this is aroutine matter that would only affect airtraffic procedures and air navigation, itis certified that this proposed rulewould not have significant economicimpact on a substantial number of smallentities under the criteria of theRegulatory Flexibility Act.
