BARROW TO VISIT WITH HOLIDAY CARD ART CONTEST WINNER Tomorrow, December 17, at 11:00 a.m., Congressman John Barrow (GA-12) will be at Collins Elementary School in Augusta to congratulate the winner of his Holiday Card Art Contest, Teia Patrick, a 5th Grader at Collins. He will present her with a framed copy of the card she designed as well as an official 2008 Congressional ornament. More than 500 students from over 100 12th District schools submitted their artwork to be used as the cover for Congressman Barrow's 2008 Holiday Card. The theme for the contest was "Holidays in the 12th District." Students from kindergarten to 5th Grade were asked to participate. Although all of the drawings and designs were wonderful, Teia Patrick's artwork was chosen from all of the submissions as the very best. It is now the cover of Congressman Barrow's card for this year. On the back of the card is a photo of Teia and Congressman Barrow. "Teia's card really represented what the holidays mean to folks in the 12th District," said Barrow. "Being at home with your family and enjoying time together is really what the holidays are all about." An electronic copy of Congressman Barrow's 2008 Holiday Card featuring Teia Patrick's design is attached to this advisory.
