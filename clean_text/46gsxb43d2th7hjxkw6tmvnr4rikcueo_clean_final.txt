WAC 04 087 5 1745 DISCUSSION: The director of the service center denied the nonirnrnigrant visa petition and the matter is now before the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) on appeal. The appeal will be rejected pursuant to 8 C.F.R. 0 103.3(a)(2)(v)(A). The petitioner is a law firm that seeks to employ the beneficiary as a foreign law advisor. The director denied the petition on the basis that the proffered position did not meet the definition of a specialty occupation. The Form G-28, Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative, submitted along with the Form I-290B, indicates that the beneficiary retained counsel to file the appeal. CIS regulations prohibit the beneficiary of a visa petition, or a representative acting on a beneficiary's behalf, from filing an appeal. 8 C.F.R. 0 103.3(a)(l)(iii)(B). As the appeal was not properly filed, it will be rejected. 8 C.F.R. 8 103.3(a)(2)(v)(A)(l). ORDER: The appeal is rejected as improperly filed.
