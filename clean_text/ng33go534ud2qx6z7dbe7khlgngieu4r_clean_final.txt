Comments will be available in the AD docket shortly after the Docket Management System receives them. Discussion We have received a report that fatigue cracking has been discovered in the fuselage skin at the upper corners of the forward passenger doorjamb on certain Model DC –9/MD –80 airplanes. This condition, if not corrected, could lead to loss of overall structural integrity of the airplane. Relevant Service Information We have reviewed Boeing Alert Service Bulletin MD80 –53A298, dated August 1, 2006. The alert service bulletin describes procedures for a low- frequency eddy current (LFEC) or a high-frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection, depending on airplane configuration, for cracking of the fuselage skin at the upper corners of the forward passenger doorjamb; and applicable corrective actions. The compliance time for the initial inspection is before accumulating 37,500 total flight cycles, or within 3,575 flight cycles (whichever is later). The corrective actions include: •For Group 1, Configuration 1, airplanes on which no cracking is found: Either repeating the LFEC inspection at intervals of 3,575 flight cycles; or installing external aluminum doublers within 3,575 flight cycles after the last inspection, and doing an HFEC inspection within 28,000 flight cycles after doing the installation, and repetitively at 20,000-flight-cycle intervals. •For Group 1, Configuration 1, airplanes on which any crack is found that is 2.0 inches or shorter in length: Repair before further flight, and do an HFEC inspection within 28,000 flight cycles after the repair, and repetitively at 20,000-flight-cycle intervals. •For Group 1, Configuration 1, airplanes on which any crack is found that is longer than 2.0 inches; for Group 1, Configurations 2 and 3, airplanes on which any crack is found beyond the edge of the doublers; and for Group 1, Configuration 4, airplanes: Contact Boeing for repair instructions before further flight. •For Group 1, Configuration 2, airplanes on which no crack is found beyond the edge of the steel doublers: Replace existing steel doublers with aluminum doublers, and repair upper corners within 6,000 flight cycles after the initial inspection; and do an HFEC inspection within 28,000 flight cycles after the repair, and repetitively at 20,000-flight-cycle intervals. •For Group 1, Configuration 3, airplanes on which no cracks are found beyond the edge of the aluminum doublers: Repeat the HFEC inspection at 20,000-flight-cycle intervals. Accomplishing the actions specified in the service information is intended to adequately address the unsafe condition. FAA ’s Determination and Requirements of the Proposed AD We have evaluated all pertinent information and identified an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of this same type design. For this reason, we are proposing this AD, which would require accomplishing the actions specified in the service information described previously, except as discussed under ‘‘Differences Between Proposed AD and Alert Service Bulletin. ’’ Differences Between Proposed AD and Alert Service Bulletin For all airplanes, the alert service bulletin specifies to contact the manufacturer for instructions on how to repair certain conditions, but this proposed AD would require repairing those conditions in one of the following ways: •Using a method that we approve; or •Using data that meet the certification basis of the airplane, and that have been approved by an Authorized Representative for the Boeing Commercial Airplanes Delegation Option Authorization Organization whom we have authorized to make those findings. For airplane configuration 4: Where the alert service bulletin specifies to contact the manufacturer for repair instructions before further flight, to avoid unnecessarily grounding airplanes, this proposed AD would require performing repairs within 90 days after the effective date of this proposed AD. Costs of Compliance There are about 76 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. This proposed AD would affect about 46 airplanes of U.S. registry. The following table provides the estimated costs for U.S. operators to comply with this proposed AD, at an average labor rate of $80 per work hour. The proposed actions vary depending upon the airplane configuration.

53497 Federal Register / Vol. 72, No. 181 / Wednesday, September 19, 2007 / Proposed Rules ESTIMATED COSTS Action Work hours Parts Cost per airplane Fleet cost LFEC inspection ...................... 1 None needed .......................... $80, per inspection cycle ........ Up to $3,680, per inspection cycle. HFEC inspection ..................... 1 None needed .......................... $80, per inspection cycle ........ Up to $3,680, per i nspection cycle. Authority for This Rulemaking Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA ’s authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, Section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency ’s authority. We are issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701, ‘‘General requirements. ’’ Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action. Regulatory Findings We have determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that the proposed regulation: Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory action ’’ under Executive Order 12866; Is not a ‘‘significant rule ’’ under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. We prepared a regulatory evaluation of the estimated costs to comply with this proposed AD and placed it in the AD docket. See the ADDRESSES section for a location to examine the regulatory evaluation. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.

Ali Bahrami, Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service. [FR Doc. E7 –18447 Filed 9 –18–07; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910 –13–P DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. FAA –2007 –29227; Directorate Identifier 2007 –NM–100–AD] RIN 2120 –AA64 Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 –100, 747 –100B, 747 –100B SUD, 747 –200B, 747 –200C, 747 –300, 747–400, 747 –400D, and 747SR Series Airplanes AGENCY : Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION : Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY : The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Boeing Model 747 –100, 747 – 100B, 747 –100B SUD, 747 –200B, 747 – 200C, 747 –300, 747 –400, 747 –400D, and 747SR series airplanes. For certain airplanes, this proposed AD would require a material type inspection to determine if the lower forward corner reveal of the number 3 main entry doors (MEDs) is a casting. If the reveals are castings, this proposed AD would require repetitive inspection of the reveals for cracking, and corrective action if necessary. If the reveals are not castings, this proposed AD would require a detailed inspection of the reveals for a sharp edge and repetitive inspection of the reveals for cracking, and corrective action if necessary. For certain other airplanes, this AD would require only a detailed inspection of the reveals for a sharp edge and repetitive inspection of the reveals for cracking, and corrective action if necessary. For certain other airplanes, this AD would require repetitive inspection of the reveals for cracking only, and corrective action if necessary. This proposed AD results from reports of cracking and/or a sharp edge in the lower forward corner reveal of the number 3 MEDs. We are proposing this AD to detect and correct fatigue cracking of the lower forward corner reveal of the number 3 MEDs, which could lead to the door escape slide departing from the airplane when the door is opened and the slide is deployed, and consequent injuries to passengers and crew using the door escape slide during an emergency evacuation. DATES : We must receive comments on this proposed AD by November 5, 2007. ADDRESSES : Use one of the following addresses to submit comments on this proposed AD. •DOT Docket Web site: Go to http:// dms.dot.gov and follow the instructions for sending your comments electronically. •Government-wide rulemaking Web site: Go to http://www.regulations.gov and follow the instructions for sending your comments electronically. •Mail: U.S. Department of Transportation, Docket Operations, M – 30, West Building Ground Floor, Room W12 –140, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. •Fax: (202) 493 –2251. •Hand Delivery: Room W12 –140 on the ground floor of the West Building, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

The Docket Operations office (telephone (800) 647 –5527) is located on the ground floor of the West Building at the DOT street address stated in the ADDRESSES section. Comments will be available in the AD docket shortly after the Docket Management System receives them. Discussion On June 30, 2004, we issued an NPRM, Docket No. FAA –2004 –18583, to address the identified unsafe condition. That NPRM was prompted by reports from eight operators indicating that cracking of the lower forward corner reveal of the number 3 main entry doors (MEDs) was found on several Model 747 airplanes. Of the twelve reveals that were cracked, eleven were made of cast 356 aluminum and one was made of machined 6061 aluminum. The cause of the cracking of the reveals made of cast 356 aluminum is fatigue. The cause of the cracking of the reveal made of machined 6061 aluminum was a manufacturing defect, which led to fatigue cracking. Subsequent to issuing the NPRM, we have been working with the manufacturer to ensure that the unsafe condition is adequately addressed and appropriate service instructions are available. We have also received new data showing other issues related to the unsafe condition. In addition to the comments received for that NPRM, the data include reports that forward corner reveals installed on certain airplanes have a ‘‘sharp edge ’’ detail at the forward edge, which could lead to fatigue cracking, and that additional airplanes are affected by the identified unsafe condition. We have determined from these data that the corrective actions proposed by that NPRM are inadequate for addressing the identified unsafe condition; therefore, we have withdrawn that NPRM and are issuing this new proposed AD.
