Math, language arts, science, social studies, and health teachers have reviewed the state of Idaho’s standards and have identified the courses wit hin which the standards will be addressed. Teachers in other “elective” areas have also identified which standards can be addressed within their disciplines. Elementary and secondary teachers have reviewed the curriculum at each grade level and have dete rmined what has to be taught at said grade level in order for students to make progress needed to meet standards when they exit the school system Develop and review standardized and criterion referenced assessments that reflect student performance in the core subject matter areas, particularly reading and math, and develop strategies that will address student needs illustrated via the assessments. Our teachers and administrators have reviewed the results produced by our own summative assessments in math, language, science, and social students, the results of the IRI and STAR reading assessments, and the ITBS and DWA/DMA results. They have subsequently developed strategies and interventions that addressed student deficiencies identified in the assessments . Teachers in our district have also developed summative assessments in elective areas for grades K -12, and are using said assessments to guide subsequent instruction. Increase student achievement by the successful completion of goals one and two; i.e., by focusing upon the results produced by various standardized and criterion referenced assessments and implementing corrective instructional strategies. Student performance on most measures used in this district has improved in mathematics, reading and l anguage. ITBS results have improved across the district, as have IRI results and STAR reading test results.
