Introduction The Kentucky Department of Education conducted a scholastic review of Stuart Middle School during the period of 10/26/2008 - 10/31/2008. This school's last combined accountability index was 64.8 and its classification was Assistance Level 2. The scholastic review team activities included a review of the documents collected for the school portfolio and profile; classroom observations (59) and formal interviews and informal discussions with teachers (61), students (87), parents (24), Family Resource/Youth Services Center staff members (2), central office personnel (8), support staff members (6), assistant principal's (3), counselors (3) and the principal. The Standards and Indicators for School Improvement rubric was the primary assessment instrument used during the visit. The team also compiled results from perception surveys, leadership assessments and efficiency reviews. All of these results were considered in the development of this report. The scholastic review report was based upon examination of the documents provided in the school portfolio, team experiences and observations. The specific findings and recommendations are organized under the headings of Academic Performance, Learning Environment and Efficiency. Each of the nine standards for success in Kentucky schools is addressed in the following pages. The chairperson of the team was Wayne Pucke tt - District Administrator. The other team members were Jesus Segundo Menendez - Parent, Cynthia Lawson - Highly Skilled Educator, Herbert D. Wheat - Building Administrator, Barbara Miller - Teacher, Nancy Gilligan - Teacher, Larry G. Frank - Building Administrator, Margaret K. Dotson - Teacher, Ru th Gail Butler - Teacher, Dr. Lynn Smith - Higher Education Representative, Bill R.

Standard 1 CurriculumSummary Findings in: Academic PerformanceStuart Middle School 10/26/2008 - 10/31/2008Jefferson County School DistrictKentucky Departme nt of Education Scholastic Review Summary Report Findings For This Standard Are Based On: Review of classroom assessments, cla ssroom assignments, comprehensive school improvement plan, curriculum documents, curriculum maps, employee handbooks, eWalk data, individual professional growth plans, Kentucky Performance Report disaggregated data, Kentucky 's Core Content for Assessm ent, lesson plans/units of study, master school schedule, protocols fo r analyzing student work, rubrics, samples of classroom assessments, samples of st udent work products, sch ool council policies and bylaws and School Report Card data Interviews with central office staff, curr iculum resource specialist, parents, school council members, school le adership, students and teachers Observations of classrooms, common areas and media center 3 Performance Rating 1a There is evidence that the curricu lum is aligned with the Academic Expectations, Core Content for Assessment, Transformations and the Program of Studies. Stuart Middle School's written curriculum mirrors the Jefferson County District Curriculum which is aligned with Kentucky Core Content for Assessment 4.1, Program of Studies, Academic Expe ctations and national standards. 1e The school curriculum provides specific links to continuing education, life and career options. Stuart Middle School offers a program in health-related careers where students explore a wide variety of fields and participate in ha nds-on activities with health professionals. The sixth grade guidance counselor works with the sixth grade students on developing th eir Individual Education Plan which includes a career skills inventory. The seventh grade students have the opportunity to explore career options in the practical living class. Eighth grade students participate in Junior Achiev ement that addresses career related considerations like education, salary and personal finance. Teachers invite speakers into their classroom and make career connections when organizing field trips. of 74

Standard 1 CurriculumSummary Findings in: Academic PerformanceStuart Middle School 10/26/2008 - 10/31/2008Jefferson County School DistrictKentucky Departme nt of Education Scholastic Review Summary Report 2 Performance Rating 1b The district initiates and facilitates discussions among schools regarding curriculum standards to ensure they are clearly articulated across all levels (P-12). The district has developed a curriculu m alignment docum ent and curriculum instructional frameworks P-12 which have been shared with all schools. Monthly middle school principals’ meetings focus on curriculum and instructional issues. Middle school prin cipals observe the implementation of the curriculum instructional frameworks in each others’ buildings and discuss their observations. The district holds two or three meetings annually for literacy leads, math leads and conten t department chairper sons at the middle school level. There have been limit ed opportunities fo r discussion and planning for vertical alig nment among f eeder schools. 1c The district initiates and facilitates di scussions between schoo ls in the district in order to eliminate unnecessa ry overlaps and close gaps. The district occasionally initiates and facilitates discussions between schools to ensure that each grade level follows the district curriculum and the curriculum instructional frameworks. District leadership initiates limited discussions between school st affs concerning vertical alignment to eliminate gaps and overlaps in the curriculum (ele mentary to middle and middle to high school). 1d There is evidence of vertical communication with an intentional focus on key curriculum transition points within grade configurations (e.g., from primary to middle and middle to high). Elementary feeder schools share student needs and academic information with the sixth grade guidance counselor . Key academic tran sition points are not systematically addressed. Sixth graders are invited to the Stuart Middle School Spartan Academy Summer Kid Camp to aid in transition from elementary to middle school. However, only twenty-five percent of incoming sixth graders attend th e camp. During the camp , the Scholastic Reading Inventory is administered to students to determine placement in reading classes. Math teachers provide mini-l essons on the use of laptops, graphing calculators and manipulatives and the students become comfortable with the physical layout of the school. 1g The curriculum provides access to a common academic co re for all students. of 74

The school council does not have a curriculum policy, and there is no systematic process to ensure that th e implementation of the district aligned curriculum is occurring. Teachers analyze student core content assessments to measure student understanding of the core content. This data is entered into the Classroom Assessment Syst em and Community Access Dashboard for Education software program. of 74

Standard 2 Classroom Evaluation/AssessmentSummary Findings in: Academic PerformanceStuart Middle School 10/26/2008 - 10/31/2008Jefferson County School DistrictKentucky Departme nt of Education Scholastic Review Summary Report 2 Performance Rating 1a Classroom assessments of student learning are frequent, rigorous and aligned with Kentu cky's core content. Most assessments are aligne d with Kentucky's Core Content for Assessment. The school council has an assessment policy statin g that assessment should be ongoing and reviewed on a continuous basis. District assessment checks occur four times througho ut the year. The school staff is involved in a collaborative process to analyze th e results of open response and multiple- choice assessments. Most informal or daily assessments are teacher-made worksheets and textbook or workbook assignments. Assessments are not always rigorous and authentic. Rubrics and models of proficient work are not visible in most classrooms. 1b Teachers collaborate in the design of authentic assessment tasks aligned with core content subject matter. Although a common planning time is provided, teachers rarely collaborate to design authentic assessments. Some assessment tasks are not designed for students to demons trate proficiency. 1c Students can articulate the academic expectations in eac h class and know what is required to be proficient. Most students are unable to articula te the academic expectations for their classes or the requirements for profic iency on an assigned task. Students are rarely required to evaluate their own work outside of checking seatwork or homework. Student reflection is not routinely integrated into instructional or assessment activities. Most teachers us e the district rubric for assessment. 1d Test scores are used to identify curriculum gaps. District leadership along with school leadership and staff analyze assessment data to identify curriculum gaps. Multiple sources of data (Kentucky Core Content Tests, No Child Left Behi nd, and Classroom Assessment System and Community Access Dashboard for Education software program) are routinely collected; however, this data is not always used to inform curricular, instructional and assessment practi ces to support higher student achievement. Some teachers examine data outside of formal assessment results and have adjusted assessments or instructional strate gies to meet the needs of students identified through data analysis. of 74

Standard 2 Classroom Evaluation/AssessmentSummary Findings in: Academic PerformanceStuart Middle School 10/26/2008 - 10/31/2008Jefferson County School DistrictKentucky Departme nt of Education Scholastic Review Summary Report 2 Performance Rating 1e Multiple assessments are specific ally designed to provide meaningful feedback on student learning for instructional purposes. Students are rarely provided with choice s in the ways that they demonstrate learning (e.g., learning styles and multiple intelligences). Occasionally teachers formally examine classr oom assessment tasks at team and departmental meetings, bu t the process is in the beginning stages and has failed to transfer into instructional modi fications. Most teac hers provide limited feedback on assessments. 1f Performance standards are clearly co mmunicated, evident in classrooms and observable in student work. Performance standards are not consis tently communicated to students. Rubrics are provided for open resp onse questions, but are not always provided for other types of assessmen t tasks. Some teachers do not use performance standards to develop rubr ics. Few models of rigorous student work are displayed or referenced for instructional purposes. 1h Samples of student work are analyzed to inform instruction, revise curriculum and pedagogy, and obtain info rmation on student progress. Teachers analyze data from Core Co ntent Assessments during department meetings but seldom analyze student wo rk. Samples of student work are used mainly for grading purposes and ra rely drive an initiative for revising instructional practices to meet the needs of students. of 74

Instructional strategies and learning activities are not always aligned to Kentucky state standards. Learning acti vities are similar to those on state assessments, but few reflect higher orde r thinking skills essential for students to reach proficiency. 1c Instructional stra tegies/activities are consistent ly monitored and aligned with the changing needs of a diverse student population to ensure various learning approaches and learning styles are addressed. Learning walks are conducted by school leadership for the purpose of monitoring instructional strategies; howe ver, the approach is not systematic and does not have the desir ed effect, which is to improve instruction. Few differentiation strategies are used and those that are, do not appropriately address the needs of various learning st yles and achievement gaps within the student population. Electron ic walk through data indicates that 5% of teachers use differentiated instruction. 1d Teachers demonstrate the content knowledge necessary to challenge and motivate students to high levels of learning. Teachers are reported to be highly qualified. However, most instruction is not sufficiently rigorous to bring about student proficiency. Electronic walk throughs conducted by the review team members indicated that only 4% of of 74

Standard 3 InstructionSummary Findings in: Academic PerformanceStuart Middle School 10/26/2008 - 10/31/2008Jefferson County School DistrictKentucky Departme nt of Education Scholastic Review Summary Report 2 Performance Rating classroom instruction includes higher-order thinking skills. 1e There is evidence that teachers incorporate the us e of technology in their classrooms. The school council has adopted a technol ogy policy, but school leadership has not developed the procedures for moni toring the impact of technology on instructional practice and student achievement. Some teachers use technology to enhance instructional de livery. Electronic walkthrough data conducted by the review team members indicates that 35 percent of teachers used technology. Technology-based programs like Read 180 and Success Maker are used for remediation with some students. Technology is used infrequently by students to create pr oducts and extend their learning. 1f Instructional resources (textbook, su pplemental reading, technology) are sufficient to effectively deliver the curriculum. Instructional resources, including phys ical as well as human resources, are plentiful. Yet, there is no overall plan within the departments or the school to indicate to teachers how these resource s should be used to maximize student learning and support the curriculum. District resources such as resource teachers are infrequently used to th eir fullest potential due to a lack of organizational structure. 1g Teachers examine and discuss student work collaboratively and use this information to inform their practice. Teachers work collaboratively during department meetings to analyze district Core Content Assessments. Collaborative analysis rarely occurs outside the departmental organizational stru cture or with teacher-generated assessments. Analysis informs some instructional practices to promote increased student achievement but is not uniform across the school. of 74

The school council has a policy on in structional practices, but the policy inadequately addresses the need for differentiation, multiple intelligences, and learning styles. There is limited use of varied instructional strategies and most instruction is done as a whole group using lecture, textbooks, and worksheets. 1h There is evidence that homework is frequent and monitored and tied to instructional practice. Homework is infrequently assigned by teachers and rarely extends students’ learning. Some teachers examine the work but do not use th at information to guide instructional practice. of 74

School leadership emphasizes a commitment to high academic expectations but has not ensured that all teachers dem onstrate high expectations for all students. Teachers are provided some op portunities to share success stories through team level meetings. 1d Teachers and non-teaching staff are in volved in both formal and informal decision-making processes rega rding teaching and learning. Some opportunities (team and departm ental meetings, sch ool council and leadership meetings) are provided for t eaching staff to be involved in decision- making that impacts teaching and learning.

The school council has adopt ed a staff assignment policy. It is the priority of school leadership to assign staff to ma ximize their instructional strengths. There is some flexibility for regroupi ng students when necessary. Student schedules can be adjusted to meet individual learning needs. 1g Teachers communicate regularly with families about individual student progress (e.g., engage through conversation). Report cards and interim progress reports are sent home regularly to families. Teachers make an effort to contact ever y family through grade level teams. Some teachers contact paren ts with positive student progress, but this is not a school-wide practice. 1h There is evidence that the teachers and staff care ab out students and inspire their best efforts. Many teachers and staff exhibit a cari ng attitude for students but a nurturing learning environment has not been es tablished for all students. Some teachers use appropriate praise and posi tive reinforcement to motivate and inspire students, but this does not occur in all classrooms. Classroom disruptions and disrespectful rela tionships between students and teachers were observed in several classrooms. Interactions between some staff and students focus primarily on behavioral compliance rather than academic performance. Some studen t accomplishments were recognized but this practice was not observed in many classrooms. 1i Multiple communication strategi es and contexts are used for the dissemination of informat ion to all stakeholders. The school does not have a formal communi cation plan to guide face-to-face and electronic communica tion with stakeholders. The school uses various venues to communicate with stakehol ders such as school web page, email, telephone calls and home visits. 1j There is evidence that student achi evement is highly valued and publicly celebrated (e.g., displays of student work, assemblies). School leadership provides some opportunities to recognize and celebrate student achievement through team celebr ations, posting high test scores and school announcements. Student success is regularly shared with families but of 74

The school council has adopted a sch ool safety plan and emergency procedures are posted in classrooms and throughout the building. Required emergency drills and safety checks ar e conducted throughout the school year. Students and school staff report f eeling safe in the school. The layout and size of the building create challe nges in monitoring safety and security throughout the campus. The school council has adopted a classroom management and discipline policy that requires Conversation Help Activity Movement Participation to be implemented. However, discipline and classroom management procedures ar e not consistently implemented, monitored or corrected by school le adership. A school culture audit was conducted in 2007. Deficien cies identified in the audit have b een addressed in the comprehensive school improvement plan. However, serious classroom management issues and classroom disrupt ions persist and create barriers to teaching and learning in many classr ooms. Ineffective use of the discipline procedures results in excess ive in-school suspensions. 1c Teachers hold high expectations for all students academically and behaviorally and this is evidenced in their practice. Teachers express they have high acad emic and behavioral expectations for students. However, high expectations are not evident in classroom practices school-wide. Inconsistent applicatio n of classroom management procedures leads to classroom disruptions and impedes the teaching and learning process in many classrooms. In some classrooms, there is a focus on behavioral compliance rath er than academic perform ance. Student s in some classrooms are allowed to disengage fr om or disrupt teaching and learning. 1e Teachers recognize and accept their professional role in student success and failure. Some teachers recognize and accept their responsib ility in student success and failure, but most emphasize the effe ct of other factors such as students’ home situation and poverty rather th an the quality of their instruction. Teachers rarely analyze student work to modify their instruction for improved student achievement. of 74

School leadership and staff collaborate to remove barriers to learning through instructional assistance and resources to ensure that st udents receive the necessary support to master core curr iculum. The Extended School Services program is offered after school to maximize student participation. Youth Services Center, Title I and student gu idance services collaborate frequently to foster a network of support for students. The Extended School Services program emphasizes math and reading. 1d Students are provided wi th a variety of opportunities to receive additional assistance to support thei r learning, beyond the initial classroom instruction. Students are provided with a variety of opportunities to receive additional assistance to support learning beyond the initial classroom (e.g., Extended School Services, literacy and math in terventions).

The school council has a policy whic h addresses parent involvement, but there is no committee policy that addresses recruitment of parents, community members, minorities and ot her stakeholders to serve on school council committees. School leader ship has conducted an open house and provided parents with in formation about school committees. At the present time, there are no standing committees in the school. There are some programs coordinated by the Youth Serv ices Center Director that bring together parents, student s, and resources outside the school for the purpose of eliminating cultural and social-economic barriers to learning. There is limited communication between the school and stakeholders. Discrimination and grievance procedures and appeals process are communicated to parents and students through the Stuart Middle School Student Handbook. 1c The school/district provides orga nizational struct ures and supports instructional practices to re duce barriers to learning. A variety of instructional materials and resources promoting student support are available. School leadership has developed procedures to refer students with special learning needs and behavior al problems for appropriate services. A procedure to identify st udents who experience le arning problems has been established and programs (e.g., Englis h as a second language services, extended school service program) are in place to support their learning needs.

Standard 6 Professional Growth , Development, and EvaluationSummary Findings in: Learning EnvironmentStuart Middle School 10/26/2008 - 10/31/2008Jefferson County School DistrictKentucky Departme nt of Education Scholastic Review Summary Report 2 Performance Rating 1a There is evidence of support for the long-term professional growth needs of the individual staff members. This incl udes both instructional and leadership growth. All teachers meet state requiremen ts for the mandated 24 hours of professional development. Due to th e wealth of professional resources offered by the district, school-based Gold Days, and approved departmental activities, many teachers well exceed those requirements; however, there is no school professional developmen t committee, needs assessment, or professional development plan in plac e to ensure focus or support for long- range plans for instructiona l and leadership growth. So me classified staff are required to have professional development, but that is a district initiative. 1b The school has an intentional plan fo r building instructional capacity through on-going professi onal development. School leadership does not develop and implement an on-going intentional plan of professional development designed for the purpose of building instructional capacity. School-based professional development, planned on an annual basis by the instructional leadership team, does not always build on previous training experiences or lead to follow-up activities. 1c Staff development priorities are se t in alignment with goals for student performance and the individual prof essional growth plans of staff. Professional development activities ar e not always aligned to the school’s learning goals. Clear connections are not always made between teacher evaluations, professional growth plans, and professional development. Due to inconsistent monitoring of professional growth plans and lack of guidance from evaluators, flexible professional development choices often fall outside the priorities set for alignment wi th goals for student performance. 1d Plans for school improvement directly connect goals for student learning and the priorities set for the school and di strict staff development activities. Throughout the comprehensive schoo l improvement plan, professional development activities are targeted as strategies for addressing student achievement. On paper, connection s are made that li nk professional development to learning goals. However, since the plan is not fully implemented as written, the connections do no t always become reality. of 74

Many teachers view professional devel opment as an isolated experience that has little relevance to their daily cl assroom performance; however, some pockets of on-going, job-embedded prof essional development are displayed through faculty members sharing expertise, mentoring and networking. A plan is not in place to ensure that pr ofessional development is incorporated into the school day and year in a cycle that moves from initial learning to practice to additional learning until mastery is achieved. 1f Professional development planning show s a direct connection to an analysis of student achievement data. Multiple sources of student achievement data are analyzed, but it is unclear how the results of the anal ysis determine professional development needs. There is inconsistent monitoring of the impact of profession al development on staff behavior or student achievement in order to effectively plan follow-up experiences. District professional development proposal forms ask for information on how the activity is tied to student need; however, the information supplied was vague and di d not supply adequate information to justify a clear connection. 2b Leadership provides t he fiscal resources for the appropriate professional growth and development of certif ied staff based on identified needs. School leadership expends professional development funds as directed by the comprehensive sc hool improvement plan which is based on identified needs. Additional funds are allocated at the discretion of the school principal on a first come first served basis to te achers requesting funding to attend conferences or workshops not spec ified in the comprehensive school improvement plan. Teachers choose their own flexible professional development with little guidance or m onitoring from leadership to guarantee its connection to identified needs or their professi onal growth plan. School council and leadership does not hav e a plan to address the equitable allocation and use of prof essional development funds. 2c The school/district effe ctively uses the employee ev aluation and the individual professional growth plan to improve staff proficiency. School leadership ensures that all staff members are evaluated according to designated timelines usin g the district documentation forms. Individual of 74

Some staff members view individual professional growth plans as a district assignment that is checked off for comp liance rather than as an avenue for impacting professional practice. 2f Leadership uses the evaluation process to provide teachers with the follow-up and support to chan ge behavior and instructional practice. School leadership completes all re quired documents in the evaluation process. A system of follow-up and su pport is not in place to adequately facilitate changes in instructional prac tice or teacher behavior. For example, post-observation conference documentatio n for some teache rs consists only of scripting the lesson with little or no regard to how teacher behavior should change as a result of what the evaluator observed in the classroom. of 74

T he data is sometimes used to change intervention groupings for targeted students in re ading and math. 1c There is evidence that all administra tors have a growth plan focused on the development of effective leadership skills. Some administrators have developed an individual growth plan for the year. Some of the plans have no t been completed in a collaborative effort, reviewed or signed by an administrator. Administra tors format their growth plans using some school priorities and leadership ski lls required by the demands of their roles. Some growth plans have one or more components that reflect the school’s efforts to build a better culture and support a safe and orderly environment. 1d There is evidence that the school/district leadership team disaggregates data for use in meeting the needs of a diverse population, communicates the information to school staff and incor porates the data systematically into school's plan. School leadership along with the inst ructional leadership team, grade level teams and academic depa rtments disaggregate dat a from the Kentucky Performance Report and Core Content Assessments. Result s from the data are shared with the staff. School lead ership and staff then use the data to target students for more intensive inte rventions. Data is used to identify significant achievement gaps among population groups, but the population groups are not identified and ta rgeted in the comprehensive school improvement plan. 1e Leadership en sures all instructional staff have access to curriculum related materials and the training necessary to use curriculum and data resources relating to the learning goals for Kentucky public schools.

Faculty, department and team meetings are held on a regular basis. Grade level teams have daily common pl anning time and are expected to meet as a team weekly or more ofte n if needed. Teachers are expected to deliver a lesson in the instructional framework that lists objectives, a sponge activity, and the expec tation that class start on time. The framework provides a structure for teacher s to efficiently pl an lessons tied to core content that maximize their use of instructional time. Many classrooms have behavior issues that hinder the e fficient delivery of instruction to support proficient student performance. 1g Leadership plans and allocates resources, monitors progress, provides the organizational infrastructure, and removes barriers in order to sustain continuous school improvement. School leadership provides an infrastr ucture to implement interventions in reading and math to address achievement gaps. School leadership monitors the school’s allocation of resources by conducting learning walks and using the evaluation of certified staff. The school’s efforts on implementation of Conversation Help Activity Movement Participation program is intended to contribute to leadership’s efforts to remove barriers to school improvement and student achievement. The Conversation Help Activity Movement Participation program is not being co nsistently implement ed schoolwide to bring about desired student and teacher behaviors that should result in continuous school improvement. Monito ring progress within the school depends mostly on assessing Core Content for Assessment data and does not always reflect the impact of reso urces on continuous improvement or focus the resources where needed most. 1h The school/district leadership provides the organizational policy and resource infrastructure necessary for the impl ementation and maintenance of a safe and effective learning environment. School council has adopted disciplin e, classroom management, and school safety policies to ensure a safe, healthy, orderly and equitable learning and working environment. Implementation of these policies and procedures is not having a profound effect on behavior that results in a productive, meaningful learning environment.

Two full-time security personnel assist th e administrative team and staff in an attempt to maintain orderly cla ssrooms, hallways and common areas. 1j There is evidence that the SBDM co uncil has an intenti onal focus on student academic performance. School council meeting agenda and minutes show some discussions, concerns and actions relative to stud ent achievement. Council discussions also reflect some focus on management issues rather than issues reflecting impact on higher student achievement. The council receives some reports from grade level teams and content areas related to the analysis of continuous assessment data.

Sufficient course offerings are provid ed within the master schedule for all students to address Kent ucky Curriculum Standards. Chorus, band, physical education, practical living and Span ish are examples of related arts opportunities that students ro tate through on a twelve week basis. Instruction, through a combination of self-contained, collaborative and resource room models, is provided for the exceptiona l children's educational needs. Some students with individual education plan s are mainstreamed into core content classes according to ability. Self-conta ined special needs students participate in some regular classrooms, (e.g., musi c, physical educat ion) with support from instructional assistants and accord ing to individual educational plans. Those students identified as gifted and talented are provided with enrichment opportunities through advanced course s to supplement instruction and enhance learning beyond regular classroom offerings. of 74

The school is allocated certified and cl assified staff in accordance with the district staffing policy. All teachers ar e certified to teach in their assigned areas. The school council has a staff assi gnment policy stipulating that staff assignments be made based on student learning needs with the option of modifying assignments as needed accordi ng to changes in educational goals and unique learning needs of students . Priority preference in scheduling classes is afforded to exceptional need s students to ensure that special needs identified in individual educat ional plans are being addressed. Collaborative teachers and instructional assistants are assigned to some classrooms for instruction assistance based on student need. The district provides additional staff in support of identified need s at the school (e.g., Title I staff, content area coaches, behavior coaches). of 74

The school has common daily team planni ng time built into the master schedule for each grade leve l, but there are no proced ures in place to monitor the effective use of the ti me. Team planning time does afford opportunities for daily horizontal planning but there are limited opportunities for vertical planning within the school or among schools at entry and exit points. The opportunity to discuss and plan for indivi dual learning needs of students is available during common planning ti me. Departmental meeting time is sometimes used for professional development activities, (e.g., instructional planning, curriculum development, di saggregation of student performance data) but there are no proc edures in place to moni tor the effective use of planning time to determ ine the impact on instructional practices and student performance. 1f The schedule is intentionally aligned with the school's mission and designed to ensure that all staff provide qualit y instructional time (e.g., flex time, organization based on developmental nee ds of students, interdisciplinary units, etc.). The school master schedule provides ample opportunities for students to receive quality instruction appropriate for age and grade levels. Few teachers implement a variety of effective instru ctional strategies and provide expanded instructional opportunities for learni ng. The schedule pr omotes successful student performance and supports the mission of the school. The master schedule is flexible and some modifications are made to address specific developmental and instru ctional needs of student s. Self contained, collaborative and resource room models are used to deliver instruction to meet the educational needs of exceptional children. Additional math and reading intervention instruction is prov ided to assist thos e students requiring additional time to master content. 2c School councils and school boards analyze fund ing and other resource requests to ensure the requests are tied to the school's plan and identified priority needs.

School council funds for materials and supplies are equally allocated to departments. The comprehe nsive school improvement plan indicates funding for various component activities, bu t these components are not regularly monitored to ensure that expenditures are based on identified priority needs. No written policy or proc edures exist to ensure fu nds are expended in an equitable, rather than equal manner, according to the comprehensive school improvement plan. 2d State and Federal Program Resources are allocated and integrated (Safe Schools, Title 1, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Family Resource/Youth Service Centers, Ex tended School Services) to address student needs identified by the school/district. Categorical funds are allocated to su pport identified student needs and according to specific program guidelines, but program strategies are not always monitored for effectiveness in meeting comprehensive school improvement plan goals or impact on student learning. Ti tle I and extended school service funding is embedded within the comprehensive school improvement plan. Title I funds are bein g used to supply three supplemental support staff members and to provide pr ofessional development opportunities for staff. Extended school service fund s are being used to support after school supplemental instruction for th ose students needing assistance. Some categorical program funds are being integrated by the school to address identified student needs. of 74

Standard 8 School Organization and Fiscal ResourcesSummary Findings in: EfficiencyStuart Middle School 10/26/2008 - 10/31/2008Jefferson County School DistrictKentucky Departme nt of Education Scholastic Review Summary Report 1 Performance Rating 1a There is evidence that t he school is organized to maxi mize use of all available resources to support high st udent and staff performance. According to a district school based de cision making policy review dated June 26, 2008, two policies requir ed by Kentucky Revised Statutes are missing and other required policies are recommended for review and revision. Current school council policies are fragmented and incomp lete. Recent council minutes reflect that the current council, under the leadership of the principal, has begun the process of developing , reviewing, revising and adopting required and best practice policies that will guide the school decision making process. The school council has a budget policy that calls for a budget committee to develop and administer the school budget. However, this committee is not functioning and there is no plan that gui des the development of budgets or outlines the methodology for budget decision making. Budgets have been drafted by the principal and presented to the council for approval with some opportunity for input from st aff. The school allocates resources, but there is no process in place to measure the effectiveness of these expenditures to meet the objectives of t he comprehensive school improvement plan or promote high stud ent and staff perfor mance. The school has recently pursued external resources in the form of grants (e.g., Fund for the Arts grant, Health Promotion: School of Excellence grant) with some success. 1d There is evidence that the staff makes efficient use of instructional time to maximize student learning. The school council has not adopted best practice policies specific to protection of instructional time. Discip line, classroom mana gement and school safety policies have been identified as needing revision by the district school council policy review. The Conversation Help Activity Movement Participation behavioral management mo del has been adopted but is not consistently administered by all staff or monitore d by administration for effectiveness. Many classrooms lack the structure conducive to an appropriate learning environment. School leadership has implemented so me procedures that limit classroom interruptions (e.g., limit an nouncements to beginning and ending of the school day). Assembly programs and ac tivities such as field trips that occur during instructional time usually re late to general learning goals. Most teachers assume hall duty between cl asses to monitor transitions and encourage students to be in class on time. Bell ring er sponge activities are used at the beginning of some classes to immediately engage students. of 74

School leadership collabo rated with faculty members, parent members of the school council and the Youth Services Center advisory council in the review of the school’s mission statement. There was minimum effort by school leadership to solicit participation from other stakeholder groups. but there was little or no participation from othe r stakeholder groups. School leadership and faculty collaboratively developed the goals for school improvement. The school does not have a written vision or belief statements that direct the school planning process. 2a There is evidence the school/district planning process involves collecting, managing and analyzing data. School leadership collabo rated with the faculty an d reviewed, disaggregated and analyzed data from Kentucky Perf ormance Report, No Child Left Behind Report, Equity and Culture Audit, dist rict core content assessments, and the district review of school council operations. School leadership reported this information to the school council. Teacher made assess ment data and the review of student work data we re not used in this process. 2b The school/district uses data for school impr ovement planning. School leadership relied on student per formance data and findings from the 2007 Equity and Culture Audit Report as sources in identifying needs and the development of goals, priorities an d action steps for the comprehensive school improvement plan. of 74

The school improvement planning team does not reference a process for the review of validated, research-based principles of teaching and learning in writing the comprehensive school improvement plan. So me district, state and national performance and cont ent standards were used to determine goals for student learning. The comprehensive school improvement plan includes components for all content areas, scho ol council and equity and culture. 3b The school/district analyzes thei r students' unique learning needs. School leadership facilitates an annual analysis of the disaggregated student performance data from the Kentucky Performance Report with the school council. While analysis of disaggreg ated data is the topic for some department meetings, the results are not being consistently used to provide timely interventions for students with unmet learning needs. Populations with achievement gaps are not identified in the 2008-2009 comprehensive school improvement plan. 3c The desired results for student learning are defined. The desired results for student acad emic and behavior performance goals identified in the comprehensive schoo l improvement plan are clearly and concisely stated, measurable and mo st accompanied by benchmarks. However, student population groups with achievement gaps, identified in the No Child Left Behind Report, are not identified in the co mprehensive school improvement plan. The comprehensive school improvem ent plan does not specifically identify strategies that ad dress the unmet learning needs of these population groups. 4a Perceived strengths and limitations of the school/district instructional and organizational effectiveness are id entified using the collected data. Some data is collected through collab oration with parents of the school council, Family Service Center adv isory council and from open house activities for parents and students concer ning their perception of the strengths and limitations in the instructional an d organizational effectiveness of the school. School leadersh ip does not solicit or receive input from all stakeholder groups. of 74

The stated goals of the school improv ement plan are clear ly and concisely written in measurable terms with most accompanied by benchmarks to measure progress over time. They are focused on improving the school’s organizational and instructional effe ctiveness. Achievem ent gaps are not identified in the comprehensive school impr ovement plan. Therefore, it is not evident that the school’s organizatio nal and instructional effectiveness is sufficient to meet the unmet learni ng needs of these identified student populations. 5a The action steps for school improvement are aligned with the school improvement goals and objectives. Most action components in the comprehensive scho ol improvement plan are aligned to the goals. However, stud ent population groups with achievement gaps are not identified in the improvem ent plan, and it is not clear how a culture of high expectations and hi gh achievement for all students will be accomplished. 5b The plan identifies the resources, timelines, and persons responsible for carrying out each activity. Resources for implementation of acti on components are identified in the comprehensive school improvement plan . Timelines are established for the action components. The timeline for the majority of the components is one year and extended time frames beyond the completion of a strategy may delay impact on student performance. Individuals responsible for leading and implementing the action components represent all content areas. 5c The means for evaluating the effe ctiveness of the improvement plan are established. A method to determine the effectiv eness of the comprehensive school improvement plan is identified. Scho ol leadership has initiated the development of an evidence binder which is maintained by each instructional staff member to measure the impa ct of the comprehensive school improvement plan. To date, the process has not been fully implemented, and some teachers do not have a clear understanding of the purpose and expectation of the evidence binders. of 74

Activities in the comprehen sive school improvement plan are aligned with the school’s mission statement, but there ar e no written belief statements for student learning. Many activities incl uded in the plan hav e been demonstrated as best practice (e.g., inquiry based instruction, Marzano strategies, Bloom’s Taxonomy) or research based programs (e.g., Read 180, Success Maker, Connected Mathematics Project) that yi eld desired results for student learning. 6a The plan is implemented as developed. Although school leadership has developed a process to ensure the comprehensive school improvement plan is implemented as developed, there is limited direction for the implementa tion. At present, there is limited emphasis on the implementation of the comprehensive school improvement plan and some staff members are not aware of the plan. Many cannot articulate the importance of it s impact on student achievement. 6b The school evaluates the degree to whic h it achieves the goals and objectives for student learning set by the plan. School leadership has developed a pr ocess to measure the impact of the comprehensive school improvement plan ’s goals on student learning. The plan states the Instructional leadersh ip team and faculty will analyze student performance data (e.g., student behavior referral logs, core content assessment data, other student assessm ent data) to determine the impact of the action components on student achievement an d to use the results to inform instructional practices. The process has not been fully implemented. 6c The school evaluates the degree to wh ich it achieves the expected impact on classroom practice and student pe rformance specified in the plan. The comprehensive school improvement pl an identifies a variety of data sources to be used to evaluate the g oals of the plan.

The vision and beliefs should be comprehensive and address key issues relati ve to effective decision making, policy development and improvement of teachi ng practices and student learning. School leadership should co mmunicate to staff and all stakeholders the importance of the compr ehensive school improvement plan and how implementation of all action components will impact student learning. With a sense of urgency, all stakeholders should accept their role and responsibility in the implementation of the comprehensiv e school improvement plan. All staff should be held accountable for the academic success or failure of all students. School leadership should immediately coll aborate with stakeholders to revise the comprehensive school improvement plan for the purpose of identifying the achievement gap populations. The revised plan should include specific researched base strategies that will yield results to eliminated achievement gaps in the student population.Standard 9 Resources: DuFour, R. & Eaker, R.E.

Summary of Next Steps:Stuart Middle School 10/26/2008 - 10/31/2008Jefferson County School DistrictKentucky Departme nt of Education Scholastic Review Summary Report School leadership should establish a procedure for monitoring classroom management to ensure that all teachers are implementing the adopted Conversation Help Activity Movement Participation program. Inconsistencies in teacher expectations of student behavior should be addressed. School leadership should hold all staff accountable for demonstrating high behavior and academic expectations for all students. School leadership should monitor the delivery of instruction to ensure teachers use varied student- centered instructional strategies that require higher-order thinking and problem-solving skills. These strategies should result in daily lessons that are relevant, motivating and focused on meeting the needs of a diverse student population. School leadership should ensure that instruction is rigorous, challenging and delivers the aligned curriculum with the goal of all students reaching proficiency. School council should continue the initiative to review, revise, develop, adopt and implement all required policies and by-laws that govern the decision-making efforts of the council. These policies and by-laws should be titled, sequentially numbered and dated upon adoption, review or revision. All policies and by-laws should be used by the council to drive instructional and operational decisions that will chart the direction of the school. School leadership should establish a procedure for monitoring the connectivity of teacher evaluations, professional growth plans, and professional development to facilitate continuous improvement that targets the needs of students as identified in and implemented through the comprehensive school improvement plan. School leadership should collaborate with representatives of all stakeholder groups to review and revise the mission statement to specifically address the school’s purpose. The mission statement should be accompanied by a carefully crafted vision and thoughtful belief statements that move the school toward proficiency, and is effectively communicated to the school community. School leadership should immediately, fully implement the comprehensive school improvement plan and monitor its impact on instructional practices and student performance. Data collected from the monitoring process should be used to review and modify the comprehensive school improvement plan in a timely manner. of 74

In Conclusion:Stuart Middle School 10/26/2008 - 10/31/2008Jefferson County School DistrictKentucky Departme nt of Education Scholastic Review Summary Report We charge school leadership and the school staff to urgently review this report and begin the process of leading their school to actions that will impact student and staff performance. We encourage the school community to view this report in depth, asking deep reflective questions about each finding and the recommendations for action that focus on the following: Will Stuart Middle School put in place systematic procedures to monitor teaching and learning that produce results and address achievement gaps? What would Stuart Middle School look like if all staff possessed the management tools and strategies necessary to provide a safe, supportive and nurturing environment where teaching and learning takes place? What is my role and specific responsibility for student performance? How can we build on staff strengths and collegiality to create a common approach to productive student work, higher-order thinking skills and instruction beyond textbook-driven teaching and learning? Is data, including continuous student assessment data, consistently and intentionally used to inform instruction, track student learning progress, and assess the impact of teaching strategies on student performance? How will Stuart Middle School leadership support new staff in ways that result in recruiting and retaining competent teachers? In closing, the scholastic audit team agrees with the school’s classification as an assistance level 2 school under the state’s assessment and accountability system. TEAM MEMBERS: of 74
