July 15, 2008 School This School ’s Report Card The New Y ork State School Report Card is an important part of the Board of Regents effort to raise learning standards for all students. It provides information to the public on the school’s status under the State and federal accountability systems, on student performance, and on other measures of school and district performance. Knowledge gained from the school report card on a school’s strengths and weaknesses can be used to improve instruction and services to students. State assessments are designed to help ensure that all students reach high learning standards. They show whether students are getting the knowledge and skills they need to succeed at the elementary, middle, and commencement levels and beyond. The State requires that students who are not making appropriate progress toward the standards receive academic intervention services.Use this report to : 1 Get School Profile information . This section shows comprehensive data relevant to this school’s learning environment. 2 Review School Accountability Status .

Attendance and Suspensions # % # % # % Annual Attendance Rate Student SuspensionsAttendance and Suspensions Information Annual Attendance Rate is determined by dividing the school’s total actual attendance by the total possible attendance for a school year. A school’s actual attendance is the sum of the number of students in attendance on each day the school was open during the school year. Possible attendance is the sum of the number of enrolled students who should have been in attendance on each day the school was open during the school year. Student Suspension rate is determined by dividing the number of students who were suspended from school (not including in-school suspensions) for one full day or longer anytime during the school year by the Basic Educational Data System (BEDS) day enrollments for that school year. A student is counted only once, regardless of whether the student was suspended one or more times during the school year.Demographic Factors Information Eligible for Free Lunch and Reduced -Price Lunch percentages are determined by dividing the number of approved lunch applicants by the Basic Educational Data System (BEDS) enrollment in full-day Kindergarten through Grade 12. Eligible for Free Lunch and Limited English Proficient counts are used to determine Similar Schools groupings within a Need/Resource Capacity category. Student Stability is the percentage of students in the highest grade in a school who were also enrolled in that school at any time during the previous school year. (For example, if School A, which serves Grades 6–8, has 100 students enrolled in Grade 8 this year, and 92 of those 100 students were also enrolled in School A last year, the stability rate for the school is 92 percent.)1 School UDALL ROAD MIDDLE SCHOOL District WEST ISLIP UNION FREE SCHOOL DISTRICT School ID 58-05-09-03-0011 2004–05 2005–06 2006–07 24 27 3 0 5 29 8 735 N/A3% 3% 97% 0% 0% 1% 4% 1% 95% N/A25 10 4 0 3 18 4 723 N/A3% 1% 98% 1% 0% 0% 2% 1% 97% N/A38 29 5 0 3 33 8 718 05% 4% 96% 1% 0% 0% 4% 1% 94% 0% 2003–04 2004–05 2005–06 2296% 3% 3796% 5% 4196% 5%

Core Classes are primarily K-6 common branch, English, mathematics, science, social studies, art, music, and foreign languages. The number of K-6 common branch core classes is multiplied by five so that these core class counts are weighted the same as counts for middle- and secondary-level teachers who report five classes per day. To be Highly Qualified , a teacher must have at least a Bachelor’s degree, be certified to teach in the subject area, and show subject matter competency. Teacher Turnover Rate Information Teacher Turnover Rate for a specified school year is the number of teachers in that school year that were not teaching in the following school year divided by the number of teachers in the specified school year, expressed as a percentage.1School Profile School UDALL ROAD MIDDLE SCHOOL District WEST ISLIP UNION FREE SCHOOL DISTRICT School ID 58-05-09-03-0011 2004–05 2005–06 2006–07 69 3% 7% 7% 46% N/A N/A 343 5%66 0% 3% 3% 52% 247 1% 334 3%61 0% 0% 2% 59% 198 0% 305 0% 2003–04 2004–05 2005–06 6% 11%18% 12%25% 17% 2004–05 2005–06 2006–07 6 N/A 1 1 4 N/A 1 1 5 N/A 1 1

July 15, 2008 Understanding How Accountability Works in New York State The federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act requires that states develop and report on measures of student proficiency in 1) English language arts (ELA), in 2) mathematics, and on 3) a third indicator. In New York State in 2006–07, the third indicator is science at the elementary/middle level and graduation rate at the secondary level. Schools or districts that meet predefined goals on these measures are making Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). For more information about accountability in New York State, visit: www.emsc.nysed .gov/irts/accountability /home .shtml 1 English Language Arts (ELA) To make AYP in ELA, every accountability group must make AYP. For a group to make AYP, it must meet the participation and the performance criteria.english language arts mathematics third indicator Secondary -Level Graduation Rate: For a school to make AYP in graduation rate, the percent of students in the 2002 graduation-rate cohort in the All Students group earning a high school diploma by August 31, 2006 must equal or exceed the Graduation-Rate Standard (55%) or the Graduation-Rate Progress Target. Qualifying for Safe Harbor in Secondary-Level ELA and Math: To qualify, the percent of the 2002 graduation-rate cohort earning a local diploma by August 31, 2006 must equal or exceed the Graduation-Rate Standard ( 55%) or the Graduation-Rate Progress Target for that group.A Participation Criterion At the elementary/middle level, 95 percent of Grades 3–8 students enrolled during the test administration period in each group with 40 or more students must be tested on the New York State Testing Program (NYSTP) in ELA or, if appropriate, the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT), or the New York State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA) in ELA. At the secondary level, 95 percent of seniors in 2006–07 in each accountability group with 40 or more students must have taken an English examination that meets the students’ graduation requirement.B Performance Criterion At the elementary/middle level, the Performance Index (PI) of each group with 30 or more continuously enrolled tested students must equal or exceed its Effective Annual Measurable Objective (AMO) or the group must make Safe Harbor. (NYSESLAT is used only for participation.) At the secondary level, the PI of each group in the 2003 cohort with 30 or more members must equal or exceed its Effective AMO or the group must make Safe Harbor. To make Safe Harbor, the PI of the group must equal or exceed its Safe Harbor Target and the group must qualify for Safe Harbor using the third indicator, science or graduation rate. 2 Mathematics The same criteria for making AYP in ELA apply to mathematics. At the elementary/middle level, the measures used to determine AYP are the NYSTP and the NYSAA in mathematics. At the secondary level, the measures are mathematics examinations that meet the students’ graduation requirement. 3 Third Indicator In addition to English language arts and mathematics, the school must also make AYP in a third area of achievement. This means meeting the criteria in science at the elementary/middle level and the criteria in graduation rate at the secondary level. Elementary /Middle -Level Science: To make AYP, the All Students group must meet the participation criterion and the performance criterion. A Participation Criterion Eighty percent of students in Grades 4 and/or 8 enrolled during the test administration period in the All Students group, if it has 40 or more students, must be tested on an accountability measure. In Grade 4, the measures are the Grade 4 elementary-level science test and the Grade 4 NYSAA in science. In Grade 8 science, the measures are the Grade 8 middle-level science test, Regents science examinations, and the Grade 8 NYSAA in science. B Performance Criterion The PI of the All Students group must equal or exceed the State Science Standard ( 100) or the Science Progress Target. Qualifying for Safe Harbor in Elementary/Middle-Level ELA and Math: To qualify, the PI must equal or exceed the State Science Standard or the Science Progress Target in elementary/middle-level science for that group.School Accountability 2 School UDALL ROAD MIDDLE SCHOOL District WEST ISLIP UNION FREE SCHOOL DISTRICT School ID 58-05-09-03-0011

July 15, 2008 School Accountability 2 Useful Terms for Understanding Accountability Accountability Cohort for English and Mathematics The 2003 school accountability cohort consists of all students who first entered Grade 9 anywhere in the 2003–04 school year, and all ungraded students with disabilities who reached their seventeenth birthday in the 2003–04 school year, who were enrolled on October 4, 2006 and did not transfer to a diploma granting program. Students who earned a high school equivalency diploma or were enrolled in an approved high school equivalency preparation program on June 30, 2007, are not included in the 2003 school accountability cohort. The 2003 district accountability cohort consists of all students in each school accountability cohort plus students who transferred within the district after BEDS day plus students who were placed outside the district by the Committee on Special Education or district administrators and who met the other requirements for cohort membership. Cohort is defined in Section 100.2 (p) (16) of the Commissioner’s Regulations. Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) indicates satisfactory progress by a district or a school toward the goal of proficiency for all students. Annual Measurable Objective (AMO) The Annual Measurable Objective (AMO) is the Performance Index (PI) value that signifies that an accountability group is making satisfactory progress toward the goal that 100 percent of students will be proficient in the State’s learning standards for English language arts and mathematics by 2013–14. The AMOs for each grade level will be increased as specified in CR100.2(p)(14) and will reach 200 in 2013–14. (See Effective AMO for further information.) Continuously Enrolled Students At the elementary/middle level, continuously enrolled students are those enrolled in the school or district on BEDS day (usually the first Wednesday in October) of the school year until the test administration period. At the secondary level, all students who meet the criteria for inclusion in the accountability cohort are considered to be continuously enrolled. Effective Annual Measurable Objective (Effective AMO) The Effective Annual Measurable Objective (Effective AMO) is the Performance Index (PI) value that each accountability group within a school or district is expected to achieve to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). The Effective AMO is the lowest PI that an accountability group of a given size can achieve in a subject for the group’s PI not to be considered significantly different from the AMO for that subject. If an accountability group’s PI equals or exceeds the Effective AMO, it is considered to have made AYP. A more complete definition of Effective AMO and a table showing the PI values that each group size must equal or exceed to make AYP are available at www.emsc.nysed .gov/irts.Graduation-Rate Cohort This term is defined on the graduation-rate accountability page. Performance Index (PI) A Performance Index is a value from 0 to 200 that is assigned to an accountability group, indicating how that group performed on a required State test (or approved alternative) in English language arts, mathematics, or science. Student scores on the tests are converted to four performance levels, from Level 1 to Level 4. (See performance level definitions on the Overview Summary page.) At the elementary/middle level, the PI is calculated using the following equation: 100 × [(Count of Continuously Enrolled Tested Students Performing at Levels 2, 3, and 4 + the Count at Levels 3 and 4 ) ÷ Count of All Continuously Enrolled Tested Students] At the secondary level, the PI is calculated using the following equation: 100 × [(Count of Cohort Members Performing at Levels 2, 3, and 4 + the Count at Levels 3 and 4) ÷ Count of All Cohort Members] A list of tests used to measure student performance for accountability is available at www.emsc .nysed .gov/irts. Progress Target For accountability groups below the State Standard in science or graduation rate, the Progress Target is an alternate method for making Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) or qualifying for Safe Harbor in English language arts and mathematics based on improvement over the previous year’s performance. Safe Harbor Safe Harbor provides an alternate means to demonstrate Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for accountability groups that do not achieve their Effective Annual Measurable Objectives (AMOs) in English or mathematics. Safe Harbor Targets The 2006–07 safe harbor targets were calculated using the following equation: 2005–06 PI + (200 – the 2005–06 PI) × 0.10 Science Progress Target The elementary/middle-level 2006–07 Science Progress Target is calculated by adding one point to the 2005–06 PI. The 2007–08 Science Progress Target is calculated by adding one point to the 2006–07 PI. The 2006–07 target is provided for groups whose PI was below the State Science Standard in 2006–07. Science Standard The criterion value that represents a minimally satisfactory performance in science. In 2006–07, the State Science Standard at the elementary/middle level is a Performance Index (PI) of The Commissioner may raise the State Science Standard at his discretion in future years.

July 15, 2008 School Accountability 2 Understanding Your School Accountability Status The list below defines the school status categories applied to each accountability measure under New York State’s accountability system, which is divided into a Federal Title I component and a State component. Accountability measures for schools at the elementary/middle level are English language arts (ELA), mathematics, and science; at the secondary level, they are ELA, mathematics, and graduation rate. A school may be assigned a different status for different accountability measures. The overall status of a school is the status assigned to the school for the accountability measure with the most advanced designation in the hierarchy. If the school receives Title I funds, it is the most advanced designation in the Title I hierarchy, unless the school is in good standing under Title I but identified as SRAP under the State hierarchy. A school that does not receive Title I funding in a school year does not have a federal status in that year; however, all schools (except charter schools) receive a state status even if they do not receive Title I funding. Schools in improvement status under Title I must provide school choice for their students; those in need of improvement in year 2 and beyond must also provide Supplemental Education Services to eligible students. Other consequences for schools not in good standing can be found at: www.emsc.nysed .gov/irts/school -accountability /about .shtml . Federal Title I Status (Applies to all New York State schools receiving Title I funds)New York State Status (Applies to all New York State public schools except charter schools) School in Good Standing A school is considered to be in good standing if it has not been identified as a School in Need of Improvement, in Corrective Action, Planning for Restructuring, Restructuring, Requiring Academic Progress, or as a School Under Registration Review. School in Need of Improvement (Year 1) A school that has not made AYP on the same accountability measure for two consecutive years while receiving Title I funds is considered a School in Need of Improvement (Year 1) for the following year.School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 1) A school that has not made AYP on the same accountability measure for two consecutive years is considered a School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 1) for the following year. School in Need of Improvement (Year 2) A School in Need of Improvement (Year 1) that does not make AYP on the accountability measure for which it was identified is considered a School in Need of Improvement (Year 2) for the following year, if it continues to receive Title I funds. School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 2) A School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 1) that does not make AYP on the accountability measure for which it was identified is considered a School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 2) for the following year. School in Corrective Action A School in Need of Improvement (Year 2) that does not make AYP on the accountability measure for which it was identified is considered a School in Corrective Action for the following year, if it continues to receive Title I funds. School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 3) A School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 2) that does not make AYP on the accountability measure for which it was identified is considered a School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 3) for the following year. School Planning for Restructuring A School in Corrective Action that does not make AYP on the accountability measure for which it was identified is considered a School Planning for Restructuring for the following year, if it continues to receive Title I funds.School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 4) A School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 3) that does not make AYP on the accountability measure for which it was identified is considered a School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 4) for the following year. School Restructuring (Year 1) A School Planning for Restructuring that does not make AYP on the accountability measure for which it was identified is considered a School Restructuring (Year 1) for the following year, if it continues to receive Title I funds.School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 5 and above ) A School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 4 and above) that does not make AYP on the accountability measure for which it was identified is considered a School Requiring Academic Progress (Year 5 and above) for the following year. School Restructuring (Year 2 and above ) A School Restructuring (Year 1	and above) that does not make AYP on the accountability measure for which it was identified is considered a School Restructuring (Year 2	and above) for the following year, if it continues to receive Title I funds. Pending – A school’s status is “Pending” if the school requires special evaluation procedures and they have not yet been completed.

For schools with fewer than 30 continuously enrolled tested students in 2006–07, data for 2005–06 and 2006–07 were combined to determine counts and performance indices. 4	If the count of LEP students is equal to or greater than 30, former LEP students are also included in the performance calculations.AYP Status 4 Made AYP ✔SH Made AYP Using Safe Harbor Target ✘ Did Not Make AYP — Insufficient Number of Students to Determine AYP StatusElementary /Middle -Level Science Accountability Status for This Subject Accountability Measures Prospective Status School UDALL ROAD MIDDLE SCHOOL District WEST ISLIP UNION FREE SCHOOL DISTRICT School ID 58-05-09-03-0011 (2007–08)Good Standing 1 of 1 Student groups making AYP in Science ✔ Made AYP This school will be in good standing in 2008-09.

July 15, 2008 About the Performance Level Descriptors Level 1 : Not Meeting Learning Standards . Student performance does not demonstrate an understanding of the content expected in the subject and grade level. Level 2 : Partially Meeting Learning Standards . Student performance demonstrates a partial understanding of the content expected in the subject and grade level. Level 3 : Meeting Learning Standards . Student performance demonstrates an understanding of the content expected in the subject and grade level. Level 4 : Meeting Learning Standards with Distinction . Student performance demonstrates a thorough understanding of the content expected in the subject and grade level. How are Need /Resource Capacity (N/RC) categories determined? Districts are divided into high, average, and low need categories based on their ability to meet the special needs of their students with local resources. Districts in the high need category are subdivided into four categories based on enrollment size and, in some cases, number of students per square mile. More information about the categories can be found in the Report to the Governor and the Legislature on the Educational Status of the State’s Schools at www.emsc.nysed .gov/irts. What are Similar Schools? In this section, this school’s performance is compared with that of similar schools. Within each N/RC category, the Department identifies Similar Schools: schools that serve similar students and have similar resources. Each school report card compares the school’s performance with that of similar schools. The following factors are considered in grouping schools: a) the grade level served by the school and b) rates of student poverty and limited English proficiency. Student poverty levels are indicated by determining the percentage of children in each school who participate in the free-lunch program. By combining these factors, a measure of student need is created and used to place schools into relatively low (lowest quartile), relatively high (highest quartile), and typical (mid-range) groups. This School’s Similar Schools Group: Summary of School Performance Performance on the State assessments in English language arts, mathematics, and science at the elementary and middle levels is reported in terms of mean scores and the percentage of tested students scoring at or above Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4. Performance on the State assessments in ELA and mathematics at the secondary level is reported in terms of the percentage of students in a cohort scoring at these levels.Overview of School Performance 3 School UDALL ROAD MIDDLE SCHOOL District WEST ISLIP UNION FREE SCHOOL DISTRICT School ID 58-05-09-03-0011 2006–07 Percentage of students that Total scored at or above Level 3 Tested 0% 50% 100% English Language Arts Grade 6 75% 251 Grade 7 73% 247 Grade 8 67% 254 Mathematics Grade 6 82% 254 Grade 7 87% 246 Grade 8 69% 254 Science Grade 8 86% 197 35 All schools in this group are middle level schools in school districts with low student needs in relation to district resource capacity.
