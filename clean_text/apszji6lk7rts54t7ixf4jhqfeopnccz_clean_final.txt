Quarterly reports are due 30 days after the close of each quarter (Due Dates: January 30 th, April 30th, July 30th and October 30th). The final report is due by October 30th . Forms are available on the OCJA web page at http://www.ocj.nv.gov .

Instead, gran t funds must be used to increase the total amount of other funds available for the grantee agency’s use. A grant recipient may not use federal grant funds to defray any costs that the recipient is already obligated to pay. For example, if a grantee, prior to applying to participate in the grant program, had committed to purchase 10 new computers for crime an alysis, then the grantee must purchase those 10 computers in addition to any computers approved in the grant budget.

The goals are general stat ements of the desired results or anticipated outcome of the program. They should address the pr oblem identified in the problem statement. The goals should be generic enough to encompass more than one project and be both realistic and achievable. Goals should NOT be stated in measurable terms. • What do you want to achieve? • Explain the goal(s) of the project in simple, straightforward terms. One or two overall goals are sufficient. • The goal(s) should identify intended impacts or outcomes and the results the program has been established to achieve. • Each goal should have one or more measurable objective describing how you intend to reach that goal. • Be realistic. • State your goals in such a way a determination of whether or not they are being achieved is possible. • Your goals MUST tie into your problem statement and outcome evaluation.

Every project design must include an evaluati on plan to determine whether the project is accomplishing its objectives. The evaluation s hould be designed to provide an objective and independent assessment of the effectiveness or usefulness of the program. Provide a plan to determine whether the pr oject accomplished the goals and objectives it was designed to meet. The plan should pres ent the qualifications of the evaluator. Describe the criteria used to evaluate the project’s effectiveness. Consider using an outside evaluator if at all possible. This will make your results more credible.

This section is for your information only and shoul d not be returned with your grant application. Example One Goal: To maximize Court resources and reduce recidivism in each Court jurisdiction. Problem Statement: The applicant should document the number of recidivists in each Court, then compare that number to existing and meaningful data, i.e., historical recidivism rates for that Court or, to statewide and national averages or, averages for similarly sized jurisdictions. If your jurisdiction’s numbers are right-on with others (not notably higher), then you don’t have a problem and the use of grant funds here is not advised, since recidivism will always exist and yours is “as good as it gets.” Your goal actually contains two problems: the firs t is recidivism and the second, Court resources. We cannot assume that recidivism by itself is the source of the Court’s overwhelm. So, you’ll also need to measure the impact that recidivists have on the Court. Your problem statement for this element should demonstrate that, of the total man-hours (account for Judges, prosecutors and support staff) per week/month/year the Court expends, xx% is spent dealing with recidivists. Compare that to other Courts’ data as suggested above. Objective 1: Now that you’ve measured the number of recidivists, you can measure the impact the proposed program will have on that statistical pr oblem. Your measurable objective should answer these five important questions: Who Will do what 3. When 4. How much 5. As measured by . . . So, an objective for this program might look like this: The number of recidivists appearing before the Court [ who] will be reduced [ will do what ] by 8% [how much ] in fiscal year 2003 [ when ], as measured by an ongoing analysis of Court records [ as measured by ]. In order for this objective to have merit: • The applicant must have measured the number of recidivists historically. • The applicant must forecast impact (a reduction of recidivism) based on real-world research of similar programs’ impacts, (not to be confused with fantasy and “I think I can” assertions.) • The applicant must track, on an ongoing basis, incidents of recidivism during the period of grant funding. The end result is an objective proposal in which the definition of success is agreed to in advance. Oversimplified, it reads like this: “The Court sees 1,800 cases per year of which 400 are recidivists.

The proposed program will reduce this number to 300 for a total annual recidivist case load of 1,400, and we’re going to prove it by counting the number of recidivists seen by the Courts next year.” It is important you distinguish between “process objectives” and “outcome objectives.” We MUST have measurable “outcome objectives” to see what progress is being made in your program. Process objectives may be very useful but shoul d only appear in the Methods section of your proposal so they are not confused with the results of your proposed. Example of a Process Objective (not acceptable in your application ) Ten Narcotic officers will complete a 5 week training program by the end of the 2006 academic year, measured by program attendance records. Example of an Outcome Objective (acceptable in your application) Ten Narcotic officers [who] will increase their grant writing skills [what] by 20% [how much] by the end of the 2006 fiscal year [when] as measured by pre and post program test scores [as measured by]. If you can’t answers all of the five questions, then you have a Process Objective which will cause your application to be rejected.
