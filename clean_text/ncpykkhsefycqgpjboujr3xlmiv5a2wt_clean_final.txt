Ms. Mary Cottrell February 12, 2002 Secretary Massachusetts Dept of Telecommunications and Energy One South Station Boston, Mass 02110 Ms. Cottrell, I am requesting an extension to the filing date of comments on Docket #01 -100, which is due to day. I am an interested party in that I have a great deal of knowledge and experience in the energy markets and derivative instruments. I represent one party other than myself. I only learned of this NOI last Friday when talking to colleague. As this NOI deals with the heart of my field of expertise I would like to participate in the process. Unfortunately, your timetable is, to no fault of yours, short notice to me. I am therefore asking for a one - week extension to Tuesday of next week to respond. I plan on suggesting a course of action that may prove to be an interesting compromise between the advocates of retail access and those against it. The issue of the use of derivative markets is not to be taken lightly as we’ve all seen with the Enron case. The input from a derivative expert without any strong bias for “making a profit” on your decision I think will be of value to you. Thanks you very much for your consideration. Sincerely, D. Neil Levy DNL Risk Management dneillevy@aol.com cc: William Stevens, hearing officer
