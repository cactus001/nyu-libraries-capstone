Social Policy Research Associates 1GUIDE TO THE READER The Data Book provides detailed informati on on the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs, including information about who is served, what services are provided, and the outcomes attained by participants. The Data Book is based on the Workforce Investment Standard Record Data (WIASRD), which is an individual-level data se t containing information reported annually by states to the Employment and Training Administration.1 This version of the Data Book uses data provided by states in th eir Program Year (PY) 2009, Quarter 4 submissions, which contain information about individuals who participated in WIA at any time from January 1, 2008 to June 30, 2010. It thus in cludes individuals who finished participation (“exited”) from January 1, 2008 to March 31, 2010 and individuals w ho had started participation before July 1, 2010, but had not finished participation by June 30, 2010. All tables in the Data Bookhave been computed using the final version of th e PY 2009, Quarter 4 WIASRD data, which includes a variety of data corrections and adjustments. Some tables also use data from previous submissions. The State version of the Data B ook contains tables based on a singl e state’s data, as identified in the header for each table. Some tables compare the state with the nation or with other states. Especially for small states, some data are base d on only a small number of exiters, as shown in either the first row or first column of each table. The reader should use caution when interpreting results based on only a few exiters. For example, pe rcentages based on 400 exiters have a 95% confidence interval of 5 percentage points. Percen tages based on 100 exiters have a 95% confidence interval of 10 percentage points. General notes that apply to most or all of the ta bles in the Data Book appear in this section. More detailed Notes to Tables are provided in Appendix A, which follows the last table. These Notes to Tables present important information that is cri tical to the proper interpretation of the data in the tables. Appendix B provides de finitions of the data items presented. Overview of Tables The Data Book contains four primary groups of tables:  Section I contains tables for WIA Title 1B as a whole, including the programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth. It also includes National Emergency Grant 1 Detailed information about this data set, including the spec ifications that states were to follow when reporting, can be found in Training and Employment Guidance Letter 14-00, Change 1. Employment and Training Administration, November 19, 2002. http://www .doleta.gov/usworkforce/documents/tegl/#14-00ch1.

Guide to the Reader Social Policy Research Associates 2(NEG) projects. This section also include s tables showing trends over time in the number of exiters by state.  Section II contains tables fo r the adult program, which serves individuals aged 18 and higher. All adults are eligible for services under the adult program. However, states are to give priority to low-income adu lts in the event that funds are limited.  Section III contains tables for the disl ocated worker program and for NEGs. Dislocated workers are generally experien ced workers who have been laid off (or received notice of termination) due to a pe rmanent closure or substantial layoff.  Section IV contains tables for the youth pr ogram, which serves individuals aged 14 to With some exceptions, eligibility for youth program services is limited to low- income youth. Sections II, III and IV all follow a similar structure. First, there are tables that show the characteristics of WIA exiters. These are followe d by tables that show the services received by exiters. The final group of tables sh ows the outcomes received by exiters. For adults and dislocated workers, two pr imary groups of characteristics are shown: characteristics available for all ex iters and characteristics availabl e only for exiters who received intensive or training services. When interpreting th e information in the tables it is important to remember that these latter characteristics were not collected for individuals who received only core services to limit the data collection burde n on individuals who received only limited WIA services. Thus, percentages for these characteri stics are based only on individuals who received intensive or training services. The adult and dislocated worker tables do not include individuals who received only self- and informational services. For dislocated workers, the tables combine in formation on individuals served by the formula- funded Title IB dislocated worker program a nd by National Emergency Grants to provide a picture of all services provided to dislocated workers by WIA Title 1. Tables show characteristics, se rvices received, or outcomes for WIA participants for the most recent year for which data on the particular characteristic, service, or outcome is available. The only exception to this is for the outcomes trends over time tables, for which the more recent time periods do not contain data for an entire year’s worth of exiters for some outcomes. The exceptions are described in the no tes at the bottom of these tabl es, as well as in Appendix A. None of the tables includes information on some other WIA Title 1 programs, including the Indian and Native American Program, the Na tional Farmworker Jobs Program, veterans' workforce investment programs, and Job Corps. These other programs are not reported in the WIASRD data used for this Data Book, but in their own separate reporting systems.

Guide to the Reader Social Policy Research Associates 3Summary of Table Notation In interpreting the data in the ta bles, the reader should note that:  Data that is not available is shown as blank. For example, in Table II-10 the percentages for the characteristics of ex iters who received in tensive or training services are not shown in the colu mn titled “Core Services Only.”  “0.0” is used to denote percen tages that are less than 0.05%. Units of Measurement The numbers appearing in the table are eith er raw counts (e.g., the number of exiters), percentages (e.g., the percentage who are female), or averages (e.g., average quarterly earnings in the quarter after exit).  Raw counts represent the number of exiters identified by the combination of the row and column headings. Individuals with mi ssing data on a row or column heading are not included in the count.  Percentages generally represent the percentage identified by the row heading among all of those identified by the column headi ng—that is they are column percentages. Some tables, however, present row percentages , the percentage identified by the column heading among those identified by th e row heading. These are specified in Notes to Tables —one example is Table II-24 that shows the percentage receiving different levels of service by state. Tables that show co lumn percentages always show the number of exiters in the first row so that the reader can see th e size of the universe on which the percentage is based. Tables th at show row percentages always show the number of exiters in the first column.  Individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are excluded when calculating percentages. In addition, all outcome data exclude individuals who were institutionalized (e.g., in a hospital or prison) or de ceased at exit or had a medical or health condition that precluded them from continuing WIA services or entering employment. However, these indi viduals are included in the number of exiters shown in the outcome tables.  Averages are calculated for selected items that are measured on a continuous scale (e.g., quarterly earnings in the quarter afte r exit) and are computed after excluding missing data. Quality of the Underlying Data The WIASRD reporting system was first effective for PY 2000. Thus, the PY 2009 data used for this Data Book represents data from the tenth ye ar of reporting. As with any new data system, states varied in how long it took to implement fully the different elements of the reporting system. Thus, the quality and completeness of th e data varies among states, especially in early years. For example, the WIA performance meas ures can be calculated from the WIASRD data and compared to data separately reported by states to ETA. This comparison showed that

--- Page 11 ---
Guide to the Reader Social Policy Research Associates 4calculations of the entered employ ment rate and retention rate fr om the WIASRD generally were close to the data reported by most states. Thus, there is substantial consistency in the data on postprogram employment. However, there were larger discrepancies for earnings change, younger youth retention, and younger youth diploma atta inment. These discrepancies have been reduced over time. When there are discrepancies, the states generally reported higher outcomes than we calculated from the WIASRD. It is not known whether the WIASRD data or the state’s calculations are correct when there are discrepancies. Some new and revised reporting requirements were introduced with the PY 2005 WIASRD. Thus, this data book includes some data reported for the fifth time. These data may be incomplete. New characteristics data items included offender for adults, other eligible person as a category of veteran status, and ever in fost er care for youth. In addition, Food Stamps was added to other public assistance. New services data include core self-service and informational activities, workforce information services and pr evocational services for adults and dislocated workers, disaster relief for disl ocated workers, and enrolled in education for youth. In addition, new categories for the type of training were repor ted for adults and dislocated workers. These new fields may be underreported, more so in the ear lier time periods covered by the data. Please see the notes to tables for more details on some of the changes. The data set used to prepare th e Data Book underwent an extensive data review. As a result of this data review, some data for a few states wa s recoded or set to missing when the data were clearly incorrect. Data that was set to missing ar e excluded from the calculations of percentages and averages in this Data Book, as discussed abov e. Consequently, state results reported in the Data Book may differ from states’ own computations from their data. Changes From the PY 2008 Data Book The PY 2009 State Data Book inco rporates a significant change from the PY 2008 version. In serveral adult and dislocated worker tables s howing performance outcomes, the column for the employment and credential rate has been replaced by a column for the credential attainment rate. The latter shows the percentage of adult or dislocated worker trainees who attain a credential, but is not one of the official WIA performance measures. Confidentiality To preserve the confidentiality of WIA participants, data have been suppressed when a column or row is based on fewer than 9 exiters. The en tire row or column will be blank. However, on the second page of two page tables “0” will s how for the number of exiters. The actual number of exiters may be anywhere from zero to eight.

Appendix A: Notes to Tables Social Policy Research Associates 271Notes to Tables Part I: Summary Comparisons Across Programs Table I-1 This table shows trends in the number of exiters by program of participation. Subcategories do not sum to totals because i ndividuals may be included in more than one subcategory. For example, a person may be co enrolled in both a local program and a statewide program. Table I-2 This table shows the number of exiters by state and program of participation. Both statewide and local programs are included. NEG programs are included in the dislocated worker and total columns. Table I-3 This table shows the number of exiters with selected characteristics by program of participation. Both statewide and local program s are included. NEG programs are included in the dislocated worker and total columns. Table I-4 to Table I-7 These tables show trends over time in the number of exiters by state. Table I-4 shows trends in the number of exiters for adults. Table I-5 show s dislocated workers who participated in state and local (formula-funded) programs. Table I-6 shows dislocated workers who participated in National Emergency Grant (NEG) projects. Table I-7 shows youth. There was a large increase in adult exiters from PY 2005 to PY 2006: from 252,065 to 624,648 with continued increases in later years. Most of this increase occurred in New York, which increased from 31,990 to 304,08 3. Most of this increase likel y occurred because of changes in practices regarding coenrollment between WIA and Wagner-Peyser. There are also significant increases in Louisiana and Oklahoma. Mississi ppi also increased but then declined in subsequent years. There was also a substantial incr ease in dislocated wo rker exiters in formula-funded programs: from 155,526 to 230,838 between PY 2005 and PY 2006. Again most of this increase was in New York: from 17,260 to 82,666. This New York increase also likely resulted from changes in coenrollment practices. There was also a large increase in Mississippi, followed by a decline in PY 2007. There was a large increase in exiters from NEG projects from PY 2004 to PY 2005 and a decrease in subsequent years. Most of these ch anges over time are due to a single NEG project in Texas (TX11), which increased from zero in PY 2004 to 65,209 in PY 2005 and then dropped to 20,936 in PY 2006 and 2,066 in PY 2007. Part II: Adult Exiters Tables in Part II include all exiters from adult programs, including both local and statewide programs. Table II-1 to Table II-13 These tables show the characteristics of adult ex iters. Most numbers shown are the percentages within the column heading. Exceptions include the number of exiters shown in the first three rows, which are counts, and preprogram earnings and average highest grade completed, for which both averages and percentage s within categories are shown. In calculating percentages, individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are excluded. Values of zero are excluded wh en calculating average preprogram earnings Some characteristics, those shown under “Charact eristics of Exiters who Received Intensive or Training Services,” are available only for individuals who received in tensive or training services. Percentages for these characteristics are calculated within this smaller universe, again excluding missing data. Table II-1 to Table II-2 These tables show trends over time in the ch aracteristics of exiters fo r both the state and the nation. Table II-2 shows counts of exite rs with particular characteristic s. These counts exclude missing data and cannot be used to compute the percentages in Table II-1. Also, the counts for the

--- Page 279 ---
Appendix A: Notes to Tables Social Policy Research Associates 272characteristics under the heading “Characteristics of Exiters who Received Training or Intensive Services” do not include indivi duals who received only core services and, thus, are an underestimate of the total number of persons with the characteristic who were served by WIA. See the notes to Tables I-4 to I-7 for discussion of some of the significant changes in the number of exiters. Table II-7 to Table II-10 These tables are based only on individuals who received intensive or training services because this is the universe for which the column headings are available. Some of these tables include a column labeled “With Intensive or Training Servi ces,” which represents all individuals for whom data on the column headings is collected and is the appropriate comparison for the other columns (rather than the data in other tables for all exiters). Table II-11 This table shows the characteristics of individu als by major service categories. The column headings “Core Services Only,” “Core and In tensive Services Only,” and “Training” are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. An individual is included in one and only one of these columns. Table II-12 This table shows the number of individuals w ith specified characteristics by major service categories. Missing data are excluded from thes e counts. Therefore, they cannot be used to calculate the percentages shown in Table II-11, which exclude missing data from the denominator of percentages. The number of exiters shown fo r characteristics that are available only for individuals who received intensive or training services is a subs tantial undercount of the total number with these characteristics because individuals who receiv e only core services are not counted. The column headings “Core Services Only,” “Cor e and Intensive Services Only,” and “Training” are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. An individual is included in one and only one of these columns. Table II-14 to Table II-23 These tables show the services received by ex iters. Most numbers shown are the percentages within the column heading. Exceptions include the number of exiters shown in the first row, which is a count, and weeks participated, for which both the average and percentages within categories are shown. In calculating percentages, individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are excluded. The row headings “Core services, including sta ff-assisted, only,” “Intensive & core services only,” and “Training services” are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. An individual is included in one and only one of these rows. The percentages shown for the six types of trai ning—on-the-job, skill upgrading & retraining, entrepreneurial training, ABE or ESL in combin ation with training, cu stomized training, and other occupational skills training—are calculated among those who received training. There is no clear distinction between skill upgrading & retr aining and other occupational skills training. Table II-14 to Table II-15 These table show trends over time in the servi ces received by exiters for both the state and the nation. See the notes to Tables I-4 to I-7 for discussion of some of the significant changes in the number of exiters. The large increase in exiters in New York between PY 2005 and PY 2006 likely explains many of the changes in services between those two periods. In particular. The increase in the percentage receivi ng only core services (from 24.4% to 67.2%) likely occurs because over 80% of exiters in New York in PY 2006 and later years received only core services.

--- Page 280 ---
Appendix A: Notes to Tables Social Policy Research Associates 273Table II-20 to Table II-23 These tables are based only on individuals who received intensive or training services because this is the universe for which the column headings are available. Some of these tables include a column labeled “With Intensive or Training Servi ces,” which represents all individuals for whom data on the column headings is collected and is the appropriate comparison for the other columns (rather than the data in other tables for all exiters). Because these tables show servi ces for a universe that is lim ited to individuals who receive intensive or training services, they should be in terpreted with caution. For example, Table II-22 indicates the percentage of low-income indivi duals receive training. However, because low- income individuals who receive onl y core services are excluded, the true percentage receiving training may be considerably less. Table II-24 This table shows services provided by state. Th e column for number of exiters shows the count of exiters in the state. The remaining columns sh ow the percentage within the state that received the service identified by the column heading. These values can be compared with the national values in the first row. Thus, unlike most other tables, this table presents row percentages, not column percentages. The distribution among the service categories within a state may be strongly affected by policies and practices regarding paymen t for services by WIA and Wagner-Peyser and coenrollment between the two programs. For example, Dela ware shows that 98.8% of exiters received training, possibly because Wagner-Peyser funds were used for core and intensive services. Conversely, in New York 83.4% of exiters received only co re services, possibly because of extensive coenrollment with Wagner-Peyser. Table II-25 to Table II-36 These tables calculate each outcome for the most recent year’s worth of exiters for whom the outcome data is available, with the exception of Tables II-25 and II-26, which show time trends. Individuals who were reported as institutionalized or deceased at exit, those who had medical conditions that precluded continued participation in WIA or entry into employment or continued participation in the program, those providing car e to a family member with a health/medical condition that precludes entry into employment or continued participation in the program, returning Reservists who choose not to continue WIA services, and individuals who did not provide a valid Social Security number are exclud ed from the calculations. However, they are included in the number of exiters shown. All outcomes are calculated within the group defined by the column heading:  The first group of outcomes shown contains the Common Measures, including entered employment rate, retention in the 2 nd and 3rd quarters after exit, and average earnings in the 2nd and 3rd quarters after exit.  The second group of outcomes contains the other WIA performance measures and comparable 12-month outcomes. These have been calculated following the official definitions. See Appendix B for summary definitions.  The third group of outcomes includes information about the job held in the quarter after exit. This information is reported for all individuals employed in the quarter after exit, whether or not they were employed at participation.  Other outcome information includes detail on some of the data used in the computation of the common and WIA performance measures. Most numbers shown are the percentages within the column heading. Exceptions include the number of exiters, earnings change, and average earnings. The distributions of earnings in the quarter after exit and earnings in the 3rd quarter after exit include only individuals with earnings in the quarter. Thus, the percentages shown sum to 100%. In calculating percentages and averages, individua ls with missing data on either the row or column heading are excluded.

Appendix A: Notes to Tables Social Policy Research Associates 274Table II-25 to II-26 These tables show trends over time in the out comes of WIA exiters for both the state and the nation. Data for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009 are complete except for the data on outcomes in the 4th quarter after exit. Data on outcomes in the 4th quarter after exit are for exiters from April 2008 to December 2008. Data for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009 do not include data on outcomes for the 4th quarter after exit. Data on outcomes in the 2nd quarter after exit are for exiters from October 2008 to June 2009 . Data on outcomes in the 3rd quarter after exit are for exiters from October 2008 to March 2009 . Data for earlier periods are complete. See the notes to Tables II-25 to II-36 for additional information. See the notes to Tables I-4 to I-7 for a discussion of trends over time in the number of exiters. These trends can have impacts on the trends in ou tcomes. In particular, the large increase in the number of exiters from New York in PY 2006 may have affected the entered employment rate and the employment and credential rate because these outcomes were lower than average in New York (and lower than previous years in New York). Table II-25 shows the calculated outcomes, while Table II-26 shows the number of exiters attaining positive outcomes. The calculated outcomes in Table II-25 generally cannot be computed from the data in Table II-26 due to exclusions from outcome measurement. Table II-37 This table shows the WIA performance measures calculated within detailed groups based on the characteristics of exiters from two different cohor ts of exiters. The entered employment rate and credential rate performance measures are given for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009, whereas the employment rete ntion and earnings change performance measures are given for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009. Using two cohorts ensures that each performance measure is calculated for the most recent year’s worth of exiters available. The column titled “Number of Exiters” contains the number of exiters in the group defined by the row heading. The remaining columns show the four performa nce measures calculated within the group of exiters defined by the row heading. All of the performance measures, except earnings change, are percentages. Outcomes for characteristics listed under “Charact eristics of Exiters who Received Intensive or Training Services” includ e only individuals who received intens ive or training services because information on the row heading is not collected for individuals who receive only core services. See Appendix B for summary definitions of the performance measures. Table II-38 This table shows the WIA performance measures calculated within detailed groups based on the services received by exiters from two different c ohorts of exiters. The entered employment rate and credential rate performance measures are given for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009, whereas the employment rete ntion and earnings change performance measures are given for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009. Using two cohorts ensures that each performance measure is calculated for the most recent year’s worth of exiters available. The column titled “Number of Exiters” contains the number of exiters in the group defined by the row heading. The remaining columns show the four performa nce measures calculated within the group of exiters defined by the row heading. All of the performance measures, except earnings change, are percentages. See the Appendix B for summary definitions of the performance measures.

Appendix A: Notes to Tables Social Policy Research Associates 275Table II-39 This table shows the WIA performance measures calculated within each st ate for exiters from two different cohorts of exiters. The entered employment rate and credential rate performance measures are given for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009, whereas the employment retention and earnings change performance measures are given for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009. Using two cohorts ensures that each performance measure is calculated for the most recent year’s worth of exiters available. The columns titled “Number of Exiters” contain the number of exiters in the state identified by the row heading. The remaining columns show the four performa nce measures calculated within the state. All of the performa nce measures, except earnings ch ange, are percentages. These performance measures are calculated using WIASRD data and may differ, sometimes substantially, from the performance reported by the state in its PY 2009 Annual Report. See Appendix B for the summary definitions of the performance measures. Part III: Dislocated Worker Exiters Tables in Part III contain information on all dislocated worker exiters, including exiters from local and statewide programs and National Emerge ncy Grant (NEG) projects, except that Table III-41 excludes exiters served only by NEG projects. Individuals served only by rapid response are excluded from WIASRD reporting and are not included in the tables. However, individuals served by rapid response—additional assistance funds are included. Table III-1 to III-40 These tables contain data on dislocated workers. There was a large increase in exiters from NEG projects from PY 2004 to PY 2005 and a decrease in subsequent years. Most of these ch anges over time are due to a single NEG project in Texas (TX11), which increased from zero in PY 2004 to 65,209 in PY 2005 and then dropped to 20,936 in PY 2006 and 2,066 in PY 2007. Some of the data for this NEG project are very different than the data for other dislocated workers, either in formula programs or NEG projects. Thus, the data are strongly affected by TX11. Table III-1 to Table III-15 These tables show the characteristics of exiters. Most numbers shown are the percentages within the column heading. Exceptions include the num ber of exiters shown in the first three rows, which are counts, and preprogram earnings and average highest grade completed, for which both averages and percentages w ithin categories are shown. In calculating percentages, individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are excluded. Values of zero are excluded when cal culating average preprogram quarterly earnings. Some characteristics, those shown under “Charact eristics of Exiters who Received Intensive or Training Services,” are available only for individuals who received in tensive or training services. Percentages for these characteristics are calculated within this smaller universe, again excluding missing data. See the notes for Tables I-4 to I-7 for a discussion of trends over time in the number of exiters. Table III-1 to Table III-2 These tables show trends over time in the ch aracteristics of exiters fo r both the state and the nation. Table III-1 shows some substantial changes in ex iter characteristics among columns. Most of these changes occur because of a sing le NEG program in Texas (TX11). Table III-2 shows counts of exite rs with particular characteristic s. These counts exclude missing data and cannot be used to compute the percentages in Table III-1. Also, the counts for the characteristics under the heading “Characteristics of Exiters who Received Training or Intensive Services” do not include indivi duals who received only core services and, thus, are an underestimate of the total number of persons with the characteristic who were served by WIA.

Appendix A: Notes to Tables Social Policy Research Associates 276Table III-9 to Table III-11 These tables are based only on individuals who received intensive or training services because this is the universe for which the column headings are available. Some of these tables include a column labeled “With Intensive or Training Servi ces,” which represents all individuals for whom data on the column headings is collected and is the appropriate comparison for the other columns (rather than the data in other tables for all exiters). Table III-12 This table shows the characteristics of individu als by major service categories. The column headings “Core Services Only,” “Core and In tensive Services Only,” and “Training” are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. An individual is included in one and only one of these columns. Table III-13 This table shows the number of individuals w ith specified characteristics by major service categories. Missing data are excluded from thes e counts. Therefore, they cannot be used to calculate the percentages shown in Table I II-11, which exclude missing data from the denominator of percentages. The number of exiters shown fo r characteristics that are available only for individuals who received intensive or training services is a subs tantial undercount of the total number with these characteristics because individuals who receiv e only core services are not counted. The columns “Core Services Only,” “Core and In tensive Services Only,” and “Training” are mutually exclusive and exhaustive—a person is incl uded in one and only one of these columns. Table III-15 to Table III-26 These tables show the services received by ex iters. Most numbers shown are the percentages within the column heading. Exceptions include the number of exiters, which is a count, and weeks participated, for which bo th the average and percentages within categories are shown. In calculating percentages, individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are excluded. The row headings “Core services only,” “Intensive & core se rvices only,” and “Training services” are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. An individual is included in one and only one of these rows. The percentages shown for the six types of trai ning—on-the-job, skill upgrading & retraining, entrepreneurial training, ABE or ESL in combin ation with training, cu stomized training, and other occupational skills training—are calculated among those who received training. There is no clear distinction between skill upgrading & retr aining and other occupational skills training. Table III-15 to Table III-16 These tables show trends over time in the servi ces received by exiters for both the state and the nation. Beginning with the PY 2005 WIASRD reporting of coenrollment in Wagner-Peyser and TAA was required. This change in reporting explains most of the increase in coenrollment in partner programs, Wagner-Peyser, and TAA. Table III-15 shows some substantial changes in services among the columns. Most of these changes occur because of a single NEG program in Te xas (TX11). See notes to Tables I-4 to I-7. Table III-23 to Table III-25 These tables are based only on individuals who received intensive or training services because this is the universe for which the column headings are available. These tables include a column labeled “With Intensive or Training Services,” wh ich represents all individuals for whom data on the column headings is collected and is the appropriate comparison for the other columns (rather than the data in other tables for all exiters). Because these tables show servi ces for a universe that is lim ited to individuals who receive intensive or training services, they should be inte rpreted with caution. For example, Table III-24 indicates the percentage of UI Claimants individuals receive tr aining. However, because UI Claimants who receive only core services are ex cluded, the true percentage receiving training may be considerably less.

Appendix A: Notes to Tables Social Policy Research Associates 277Table III-26 This table shows services provided by state. Th e column for number of exiters shows the count of exiters in the state. The remaining columns sh ow the percentage within the state that received the service identified by the column heading. These values can be compared with the national values in the first row. Thus, unlike most other tables, this table presents row percentages, not column percentages. The distribution among the service categories within a state may be strongly affected by policies and practices regarding paymen t for services by WIA and Wagner-Peyser and coenrollment between the two programs. For example, Nebr aska shows that 81.3% of exiters received training, possibly because Wagner-Peyser funds were used for core and intensive services. Conversely, 81.2% of exiters in New York recei ved only core services, possibly because of extensive coenrollment with Wagner-Peyser. Table III-27 to Table III-39 These tables calculate each outcome for the most recent year’s worth of exiters for whom the outcome data is available, with the exception of Table III-27 and Table III-28, which show trends over time. Individuals who were reported as institutionalized or deceased at exit, those who had medical conditions that precluded continued participation in WIA or entry into employment or continued participation in the program, those providing car e to a family member with a health/medical condition that precludes entry into employment or continued participation in the program, returning Reservists who choose not to continue WIA services, and individuals who did not provide a valid Social Security number are exclud ed from the calculations. However, they are included in the number of exiters shown. All outcomes are calculated within the group defined by the column heading:  The first group of outcomes shown contains the Common Measures, including entered employment rate, retention in the 2nd and 3rd quarters after exit, and average earnings in the 2nd and 3rd quarters after exit.  The second group of outcomes contains the other WIA performance measures and comparable 12-month outcomes. These have been calculated following the official definitions. See Appendix B for summary definitions.  The third group of outcomes includes information about the job held in the quarter after exit. This information is reported for all individuals employed in the quarter after exit, whether or not they were employed at participation.  Other outcome information includes detail on some of the data used in the computation of the common and WIA performance measures. Most numbers shown are the percentages within the column heading. Exceptions include the number of exiters, earnings change, and average earnings. The distributions of earnings in the quarter after exit and earnings in the 3rd quarter after exit include only individuals with earnings in the quarter. Thus, the percentages shown sum to 100%. In calculating percentages and averages, individua ls with missing data on either the row or column heading are excluded. Table III-27 to Table III-28 These tables show trends over time in the out comes of WIA exiters for both the state and the nation. Data for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009 are complete except for the data on outcomes in the 4th quarter after exit. Data on outcomes in the 4th quarter after exit are for exiters from April 2008 to December 2008. Data for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009 do not include data on outcomes for the 4th quarter after exit. Data on outcomes in the 2nd quarter after exit are for exiters from October 2008 to June 2009 . Data on outcomes in the 3rd quarter after exit are for exiters from October 2008 to March 2009 .

Appendix A: Notes to Tables Social Policy Research Associates 278Data for earlier periods are complete, except for a few states. See the notes to Tables III-27 to III-39 for additional information. See the notes to Tables I-4 to I-7 for a discussion of trends over time in the number of exiters. These trends can have impacts on the trends in outcomes. Table III-27 shows the calculated outcomes, while Table III-28 shows the number of exiters attaining positive outcomes. The calculated outcomes in Table II-27 generally cannot be computed from the data in Table II-28 due to exclusions from outcome measurement. Table III-40 This table shows the WIA performance measures calculated within detailed groups based in the characteristics of exiters from two different cohor ts of exiters. The entered employment rate and credential rate performance measures are given for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009, whereas the employment retention and earnings change performance measures are given for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009. Using two cohorts ensures that each performance measure is calculated for the most recent year’s worth of exiters available. The column titled “Number of Exiters” contains the number of exiters in the group defined by the row heading. The remaining columns show the four performa nce measures calculated within the group of exiters defined by the row heading. All of the performance measures, except earnings change, are percentages. Outcomes for characteristics listed under “Charact eristics of Exiters who Received Intensive or Training Services” includ e only individuals who received intens ive or training services because information on the row heading is not collected for individuals who receive only core services. See Appendix B for summary definitions of the performance measures. Table III-41 This table shows the WIA performance measures calculated within detailed groups based on services received by exiters from two different c ohorts of exiters. The entered employment rate and credential rate performance measures are given for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009, whereas the employment rete ntion and earnings change performance measures are given for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009. Using two cohorts ensures that each performance measure is calculated for the most recent year’s worth of exiters available. The column titled “Number of Exiters” contains the number of exiters in the group defined by the row heading. The remaining columns show the four performa nce measures calculated within the group of exiters defined by the row heading. All of the performance measures, except earnings change, are percentages. See the Appendix B for the calcula tions of the performance measures. Table III-42 This table shows the WIA performance measures calculated within each st ate for exiters from two different cohorts of exiters. The entered employment rate and credential rate performance measures are given for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009, whereas the employment retention and earnings change performance measures are given for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009. Using two cohorts ensures that each performance measure is calculated for the most recent year’s worth of exiters available. Unlike the other outcome tables, exiters who r eceived services only from NEG projects are excluded from the calculations of the performance measures and the exiter counts in this table because they are excluded from the st ates’ official performance calculations. The columns titled “Number of Exiters” contain the number of exiters in the state identified by the row heading. The remaining columns show the four performa nce measures calculated within the state. All of the performance measures ar e percentage. These performance measures are calculated using WIASRD data and may differ, sometimes substantially, from the performance reported by the state in its PY 2009 Annual Report. See Appendix B for the calculations of the performance measures.

Appendix A: Notes to Tables Social Policy Research Associates 279Part IV: Youth Exiters Tables in Part IV include all exiters from youth programs, including both local and statewide programs. Table IV-1 to Table IV-12 These tables show the characteristics of exiters for both older and younger youth. Most numbers shown are the percentages within the column heading. Exceptions include the number of exiters shown in the first three rows, which are counts, and preprogram earnings and average highest grade completed, for which both averages and percentages within categories are shown. In calculating percentages, individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are excluded. Values of zero are excluded wh en calculating average preprogram earnings. Veteran and preprogram quarterly earnings are av ailable only for older youth, those at least age 19 at participation. Table IV-1 to Table IV-2 These tables show trends over time in the ch aracteristics of exiters fo r both the state and the nation. Table IV-2 shows counts of exiters with particul ar characteristics. These counts exclude missing data and cannot be used to compute the percentages in Table II-1. Table IV-12 This table shows the characteristics of youth wh o received specific youth activities. Youth who are not reported as receiving any of the you th activities are excluded from the table. Table IV-13 to Table IV-23 These tables show the services received by ex iters. Most numbers shown are the percentages within the column heading. Exceptions include the number of exiters shown in the first row, which is a count, and weeks participated, for which both the average and percentages within categories are shown. The percentages for the youth activities are based on youth reported as receiving at least one of the activities. In calculating percentages, individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are excluded. Table IV-13 to Table IV-14 These tables show trends over time in the servi ces received by exiters for both the state and the nation. Beginning with the PY 2005 WIASRD reporting of coenrollment in Wagner-Peyser and TAA was required. This change in reporting explains most of the increase in coenrollment in partner programs, Wagner-Peyser, and TAA. Table IV-24 This table shows youth activities provided by state. The column for number of exiters shows the count of exiters in the state. The remaining columns show the percentage within the state that received the youth activity identif ied by the column heading. These percentages are based on youth reported as receiving at least one of the youth activities. These values can be compared with the national values in the first row. Thus , unlike most other tables, this table presents row percentages, not column percentages. Table IV-25 to Table IV-36 These tables show outcomes attained by youth exiters. Except in Tables IV-23 and 24, data for youth retention are for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009, data for diploma attainment and skill attainment are for exiters from April 2009 to March 2010, data for placement are for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009, data for attending secondary school at exit are for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009 , and data for literacy and numeracy gains are based on participation years that began between July 2007and June 2008. Individuals who were reported as institutionalized or deceased at exit, those who had medical conditions that precluded continued participation in WIA or entry into employment or continued participation in the program, those providing car e to a family member with a health/medical condition that precludes entry into employment or continued participation in the program, returning Reservists who choose not to continue WIA services, and individuals who did not provide a valid Social Security number are exclud ed from the calculations. However, they are

Appendix A: Notes to Tables Social Policy Research Associates 280included in the number of exiters shown. All outcomes are calculated within the group defined by the column heading.  The first group of outcomes shown contains the youth common measures.  The second group contains additional outcomes for all youth. These include detail on some of the data used in the computation of the common measures and additional outcomes.  The third group includes the older youth WIA performance measures.  The fourth group contains the younger youth WIA performance measures. The skill attainment rate differs substantially from the of ficial definition because it is based only on exiters and includes all goals set for the youth during the youth’s period of participation. It is calculated as the total number of goals attained by the youth divided by the total number of goals set for the youth, excluding goals pending at exit for youth reported as institutionalized or deceased at exit and thos e who had medical conditions that precluded continued participation in WIA or entry into employment. See Appendix B for summary definitions of the outcomes. Most numbers shown are the percentages within the column heading. Exceptions include the number of exiters. The skill attainment rate is based on all goals set for youth identified by the column head. Table IV-25 to Table IV-26 These tables show trends over time in the out comes of WIA exiters for both the state and the nation. Data for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009 are complete except for data on retention. Data on retention are for exiters from October 2008 to March 2009 . Data for exiters from April 2009 to March 2010 do not include data on retention. Data on placement is for exiters from April 2009 to September 2009 . Data for literacy and numeracy gains below the heading “PY 2008” are based on participation years that began between July 2007 and June 2008; those below the heading “PY 2007” are based on participation years that began between July 2006 and June 2007. Table IV-25 shows the calculated outcomes, while Table IV-26 shows the number of exiters attaining positive outcomes. The calculated outcomes in Table II-25 generally cannot be computed from the data in Table IV-26 due to exclusions from outcome measurement. Tables IV-37 to IV-39 These tables show outcomes on the youth common measures: placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree or cer tificate, and literacy and numeracy gains. Placement in employment or education is based on exiters from October 2008 to September 2009 who were not in post-secondary education or employment at the date of participation. Attainment of a degree or certificate is based on exiters from October 2008 to September 2009 who were enrolled in education at the date of participation or at any point during the program. Literacy and numeracy gains is based on the definition for the third year of implementation and includes basic skills deficient out-of-school youth who began participation between July 2005 and June 2008. Table IV-37 This table shows the youth common measures cal culated within detailed groups based on the characteristics two different cohorts of youth. Placement in employment or education and attainment of a degree or certificate are given for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009, whereas literacy and numeracy gains is based on youth who began participation between July 2005 and June 2008. However, youth who began participation in PY 2005 must have completed three years of participation to be included in PY 2008 literacy and numeracy and those who began in PY 2006 must have completed two years. The columns titled “Number of Exiters” or “Number of Youth” contain the number of youth in

Appendix A: Notes to Tables Social Policy Research Associates 281the group defined by the row heading. The remaining columns show the three common calculated within the group of youth defined by the row heading. All of the common measures are percentages. See Appendix B for summary definitions of the common measures. Table IV-38 This table shows the youth common measures cal culated within detailed groups based on the services received by two different cohorts of youth. Placement in employment or education and attainment of a degree or certificate are given for exiters from October 2007 to September 2008, whereas literacy and numeracy gains is based on youth who began participation between July 2005 and June 2008. However, youth who began participation in PY 2005 must have completed three years of participation to be included in PY 2008 literacy and numeracy and those who began in PY 2006 must have completed two years. The columns titled “Number of Exiters” or “Number of Youth” contain the number of youth in the group defined by the row heading. The remaining columns show the three common calculated within the group of youth defined by the row heading. All of the common measures are percentages. See Appendix B for summary definitions of the common measures. Table IV-39 This table shows the youth common measures calculated within each state. Placement in employment or education and attainment of a degree or certificate are given for exiters from October 2007 to September 2008, whereas literacy and numeracy gains is based on youth who began participation between July 2005 and June 2008. However, youth who began participation in PY 2005 must have completed three years of pa rticipation to be included in PY 2008 literacy and numeracy and those who began in PY 2006 must have completed two years. The columns titled “Number of Exiters” or “Number of Youth” contain the number of youth in the group defined by the row heading. The remaining columns show the three common calculated within the group of youth defined by the row heading. All of the common measures are percentages. These common measures are calculated usi ng WIASRD data and may differ, sometimes substantially, from the outcomes reported by the state in its PY 2007 Annual Report. In particular, some states were in the second y ear of implementation for literacy and numeracy gains and reported that measure based on a differe nt calculation in the PY 2007 Annual Report. See Appendix B for summary definitions of the common measures. Table IV-40 This table shows the WIA younger youth performance measures calculated within detailed groups based on the characteristics of exiters. Th e retention rate is based on exiters from April 2008 to March 2009; diploma attainment and skill attainment are based on exiters from April 2009 to March 2010. The columns titled “Number of Exiters” contain the number of exiters in the group defined by the row heading, within the relevant time period shown by the column heading. The remaining columns show the three pe rformance measures calculated within the group of exiters defined by the row heading, again for the time period shown by the column heading. All of the performance measures are percentages. However, the skill attain ment rate is a percentage of all goals set for exiters, rather than of exiters. This skill attainment rate is different from the official performance measure. See Appendix B for summary definitions of the performance measures and the notes to Tables IV-23 to IV-32 for more detail. Table IV-41 This table shows the younger youth WIA performance measures calculated within detailed groups based on the services received by exiters. See the notes to Table IV-33 and Tables IV-23 to IV-32 for more detail on the calculations and Appendix B for summary definitions of the performance measures.

Appendix A: Notes to Tables Social Policy Research Associates 282Table IV-42 This table shows the younger youth WIA performance measures for younger youth calculated within states. See the notes to Table IV-33 an d Tables IV-23 to IV-32 for more detail on the calculations and Appendix B for summary definitions of the performance measures. The skill attainment rate differs from th e official performance measure. Because these performance measures are calcu lated from WIASRD data, the numbers shown may differ, sometimes substantially, from the performance reported by the states in their PY 2008 Annual Reports. Table IV-43 This table shows the older youth WIA performa nce measures calculated within detailed groups based on the characteristics of exiters from two different cohorts of exiters. The entered employment rate and credential rate performance measures are given for exiters from October 2007 to September 2008, whereas the employment retention and earnings change performance measures are given for exiters from April 2007 to March 2008. Using two cohorts ensures that each performance measure is calculated for the most recent year’s worth of exiters available. The columns titled “Number of Exiters” contain the number of exiters in the group defined by the row heading. The remaining columns show the four performa nce measures calculated within the group of exiters defined by the row heading. All of the performance measures, except earnings change, are percentages. See Appendix B for summary definitions of the performance measures. Table IV-44 This table shows the older youth WIA performa nce measures calculated within detailed groups based on the services received by exiters from two different cohorts of exiters. The entered employment rate and credential rate performance measures are given for exiters from October 2007 to September 2008, whereas the employment retention and earnings change performance measures are given for exiters from April 2007 to March 2008. Using two cohorts ensures that each performance measure is calculated for the most recent year’s worth of exiters available. The columns titled “Number of Exiters” contain the number of exiters in the group defined by the row heading.
