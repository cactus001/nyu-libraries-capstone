The Commission, having reviewed the evidence of record and being advlaed, is of the opinion and finds that: Effective January 1, 1989, Huhlenberg's supplier, City of Central City, will increase its rates for wholesale water from $.891 to $1.0094 per 1,000 gallons. Muhlenberg proposed to adjust the rates to its customers effective January 1, 1989. During the 12 months ending September 1988, Muhlenberg purchased 421,199,600 gallons of water and sold 303,795,100 gallons. Muhlenberg's initial calculations are incorrect in that it erroneously divided the increase in costs by the gallons purchased rather than the gallons sold. Additional information was filed on December 12, 1988 correcting this error.
