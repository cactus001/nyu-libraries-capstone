/one.pnum Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus /two.pnum (SARS-CoV/two.pnum) emerged in Wuhan, China, in November /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/nine.pnum. By October /two.pnum/zero.pnum/two.pnum/zero.pnum, this virus had resulted in more than /four.pnum/one.pnum./five.pnum million cases of COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum and /one.pnum million deaths. The majority of COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum cases currently being reported are predominantly in developed countries, such as the United States, Brazil, Russia, and France. Despite the increasing number of models and stud- ies on COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum, there is very little information available to inform humanitarian response interventions, the need for which may be unprecedented, particularly where infrastructure is lacking to effectively prevent spread of transmission and treat affected patients. In late /two.pnum/zero.pnum/one.pnum/nine.pnum, the United Nations (UN) Of/uniFB01ce for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Centre for Humanitarian Data created a new workstream for predictive analytics. This was based on demand from OCHA’s leadership to “use data, and especially the tools of predictive analytics to get ahead, to be more an- ticipatory, to predict what is about to happen and to trigger the response earlier.” This ambition aligns with the overall goal of the Centre, which is to increase the use and impact of data in the humanitarian sector. The COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum pandemic has brought into stark focus the need for data and the value of models to inform response strategies. Anticipatory action is no longer an abstract idea but something populations are actively doing by staying home and increasing the number of hospital beds to protect the most vulnerable popula- tions. Epidemic forecasting is one tool through which we can gain an understanding of the /uniFB01nal outbreak size and indicators of when the COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum epidemic peaks in a country. This provides decision-makers with the capability to plan, surge, and manage resources during a pandemic. UN OCHA and the Johns Hopkins Uni- versity Applied Physics Laboratory have therefore established a partnership to inform COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum strategies for humanitarian interventions by both national authorities and the humanitarian community in selected high-priority countries, resulting in increased technical capacity to predict new and compounded humani- tarian needs, and use of data science to arrive at interventions to mitigate them. This partnership developed a series of adjustments to a novel COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum model (JHUAPL-Bucky) that in- corporates different vulnerability factors to provide insights on the scale of the crisis in priority countries at national and sub-national levels, how different response interventions are expected to impact the epi- demic curve, and the duration of the crisis in speci/uniFB01c locations. The resultant model (OCHA-Bucky) strati- /uniFB01es COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum dynamics by age and population vulnerability. Input to the model consists of geographically distributed COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum cases and deaths, as well as attributes such as inter-regional mobility, population vul- nerability, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) , and social contact matrices. Model output consists of future projections of these same quantities, as well as severe cases (de/uniFB01ned as a proportion of total cases). The model considers both inter-regional mobility of the population and time-varying NPIs. OCHA-Bucky has been used to provide weekly projections to six OCHA country of/uniFB01ces: Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, and South Sudan. The results of this model, when applied in the context of the United States, have been included in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum Mathematical Modeling Forecasting Ensemble [/one.pnum]. Here, we detail the modi/uniFB01cations of the JHUAPL-Bucky model used to shift results to the context of countries in receipt of humanitarian aid. A number of critical complementary components must be modi/uniFB01ed in order to perform accurate disease modeling within this context. Namely, these include: •Estimating disease parameters; •Acquiring data sources that accurately re/uniFB02ect both the current and historical states of the outbreak; •Estimating mobility within a country; •Estimating the impact of secondary/tertiary factors on the vulnerability of a given population; •Estimations of the effects of measures taken by individuals and governments to curb the spread of the disease; and The Centre for Humanitarian Data centre.humdata.org | Join our mailing list: bit.ly/humdatamailing | Twitter: @humdata | Email: centrehumdata@un.org /three.pnum

•Estimations of the effects of the above at both the sub-national and national levels. The following sections describe the OCHA-Bucky model in detail. Section /two.pnum./one.pnum gives an overview of the model and its components. Further details related to parameter estimation, data sourcing, and model initialization are given in Sections /two.pnum./two.pnum and /two.pnum./three.pnum, respectively. Section /three.pnum details the model input and output. Lastly, this model is publicly available; details about how to access the model as well as the corresponding documentation are given in Section /four.pnum. /two.pnum Model Description The JHUAPL-Bucky model is a COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum metapopulation compartment model initially designed to estimate medium-term (on the order of weeks) case incidence and healthcare usage at the second administrative (admin-/two.pnum, ADM/two.pnum) level (counties in the United States; cities or districts in various countries). These ADM/two.pnum regions are all coupled using mobility information to approximate the inter- and intra-regional contacts be- tween the members of the populations. Using the historical case and death data, local demographic data, and a set of parameters derived from empirical studies (Section /two.pnum./two.pnum./one.pnum), the model infers a number of local- ized features (given in Table /one.pnum) that are related to the spread of COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum. Projecting forward in time, Bucky then uses an age-strati/uniFB01ed compartment model to estimate the case load as well as provide outputs relating to the healthcare burden of each locality. These time forecasts are performed numerous times (Monte Carlo experiments), with each individual simulation using minor modi/uniFB01cations to the input parameters at random, scaled to the uncertainty of the estimates. The resulting collection of simulations is then used to obtain probabilistic estimates for all output variables. A fork of JHUAPL-Bucky, the OCHA-Bucky model, addition- ally includes a set of new features to properly handle the unique aspects of epidemic modeling in countries beyond the United States. To this end, the OCHA-Bucky model includes a series of factors related to the relative vulnerability of local populations. /two.pnum./one.pnum Model Overview At its base, the OCHA-Bucky model is a spatially distributed SEIR model. SEIR models are a class of determin- istic models used to demonstrate how infectious diseases that are spread by person-to-person transmission in a population. The simplest versions of such models are systems of ordinary differential equations and are analysed mathematically [/two.pnum]. Within the context of an SEIR model, disease dynamics are modeled over time by moving the population through a series of compartments (otherwise known as "bins" or "states"). Those states are as follows: •Susceptible (S): the fraction of the population that could be potentially subjected to the infection; •Exposed (E): the fraction of the population that has been infected but does not show symptoms yet; •Infectious (I): the fraction of the population that is infective after the latent period; •Recovered (R): the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered from the infection. The total population is represented by the sum of the compartments. Basic assumptions of this type of model: •Once the model is initialized, no individuals are added to the susceptible group. It follows that births and natural deaths are unaccounted for, migration into and out of the region is frozen for the duration of a simulation, and none of the population has been vaccinated or is immune to the pathogen; •The population within each strata is uniform, and each pair of individuals within the strata are equally likely to interact; •The probability of interaction between individuals in the population is not rare; •Once infected, an individual cannot be reinfected with the virus.

Note that the compartments E, Iasym, Imild, Ihospand Rhospare gamma-distributed with shape parameters speci/uniFB01ed in the con/uniFB01guration /uniFB01le. The OCHA-Bucky model consists of a collection of coupled and strati/uniFB01ed SEIR models. Since COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum exhibits heavily age-dependent properties, wherein a majority of severe cases are in older individuals, SEIR models are strati/uniFB01ed via the age demographic structure of a geographic region to obtain accurate estimates of case severity and deaths. Additionally, to model the spatial dynamics of COVID spread, we consider a set of SEIR sub-models at the smallest geographic level for which we have appropriate data. (See Section /two.pnum./three.pnum for a discussion of available data.) The basic structure of the model is displayed in Figure /one.pnum. Age is denoted by index i, and geographic regions are denoted by index j. Within each strata, OCHA-Bucky models the susceptible and exposed populations, followed by one of three possible infected states: asymptomatic (Iasym), mild (Imild), and severe (Ihosp). Mem- bers of the population who are either asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms recover from the virus at a rate. Those who exhibit severe symptoms and are in need of healthcare support will either recover after a period of illness at rate 1=ior expire as a result of the virus at rate i. A critical component of the OCHA-Bucky model is the parameterization of the model (Section /two.pnum./two.pnum). A number of parameters must be derived and/or estimated from their original data sources. These include, but are not limited to, those listed in Table /one.pnum as well as local estimates of local case doubling time, case reporting rate, case fatality rate, and case hospitalization rate. Further details of these quantities as well as how they are estimated are given in Section /two.pnum./two.pnum. All parameter estimation for the model includes the basic assumption that, once estimated and initialized, these parameters remain constant during the simulation period. Coupling individual age and geographically strati/uniFB01ed sub-models occurs across a number of dimensions including disease state and pre-existing vulnerability. Sub-models are coupled together using both the spa- tial mobility matrix (see Section /two.pnum./three.pnum./three.pnum) and age-based contact matrices (see Section /two.pnum./three.pnum./five.pnum). Modeling of the overall interaction rates between geographic locations and age groups is an important component in ac- curately modeling non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). OCHA-Bucky accounts for the implementation of NPIs (e.g., school closures, border closures, face mask wearing) via modifying either the social contact matrices or the basic reproductive number, R0. Further details are given in Section /two.pnum./three.pnum.6. Together, these components contribute to a model that is adaptable to a number of contexts. OCHA-Bucky is calibrated to the uncertainties in the case data and the disease parameters, leading to a model that is robust to the quality and resolution of available input data.

The percentage of infections that are asymptomatic ( ) refers to the percentage of infections that will never develop symptoms. This is a dif/uniFB01cult parameter to estimate due to logistical complications (individuals would need to be tested to ensure they remain asymptomatic while infectious) and because the level of asymptomatic infections varies by age. The best estimate for this parameter is the midpoint between the lower bound of [/four.pnum], the upper bound of [/five.pnum], which corresponds to the estimates from [6]. The relative infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals compared to symptomatic individuals (rel_inf_asym) is calculated using upper and lower bounds on the difference in viral dynamics between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. The lower bound is derived from data indicating that more severe cases have higher viral loads [/seven.pnum] and a study that indicates symptomatic cases shed for longer and have higher viral loads than asymptomatic cases [8]. Other studies indicate that both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases have similar duration and viral shedding [/nine.pnum], which is used as the upper bound. The /uniFB01nal parameter relating to disease transmission is the fraction of transmission prior to symptom onset (frac_trans_before_sym), which corresponds to the percentage of new cases caused by transmission from an individual before they become symptomatic. The lower bound is derived from [/one.pnum/zero.pnum], with the upper bound derived from [/one.pnum/one.pnum].

/two.pnum./two.pnum./one.pnum./two.pnum Disease Characteristics and Severity The mean serial interval, Ts, is the time in days from exposure to onset of symptoms and is taken from [/one.pnum/two.pnum]. The mean generation interval, Tg, is the period of time (in days) between symptom onset for one individual and symptom onset for a person they have infected. This value is from [/one.pnum/zero.pnum]. The case fatality ratio (CFR) is the number of individuals who will die of the disease; the case hospitalization- severity ratio (CHR) corresponds to the number of cases that are severe and necessitate hospitalization. Within the context of the United States, this ratio corresponds to the individuals admitted to a hospital. In a context where access to medical care is limited, this ratio corresponds to the ratio of individuals who exhibit severe disease symptoms. Hospital-related parameters are derived using data from COVID-Net [/one.pnum/three.pnum] and the CDC’s Data Collation and Integration for Public Health Event Response (DCIPHER). All data is taken from the period between March /one.pnum, /two.pnum/zero.pnum/two.pnum/zero.pnum to July /one.pnum/five.pnum, /two.pnum/zero.pnum/two.pnum/zero.pnum unless otherwise noted. The time it takes from symptom onset to hospitalization in days is denoted by I_to_H_time. The number of days an individual will be hospitalized is H_TIME. Finally, the number of days between death and reporting is D_REPORT_TIME. /two.pnum./two.pnum./two.pnum Approximated and Derived Parameters Unless otherwise noted, the model parameters that are derived from input parameters/one.pnumand the historical data are estimated as the average value across the entire population of a region (i.e., they are not age- strati/uniFB01ed). This limitation results from having a lack of age-strati/uniFB01ed historical case and death data in most regions. Additionally, some parameters are only derived at the national (ADM/zero.pnum) level due to sparse reporting at the sub-national level (see footnotes). •Local mean Case Fatality Ratio, j; We must begin by estimating the local overall CFR for each region based on the local demographics. Since the fatality rate for COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum is highly age dependent, this overall CFR will vary dramatically between region with different age structure [/one.pnum/five.pnum]. By contracting the CFR as a function of age with the local age demographics of each region, we can obtain the region overall estimate for the CFR, j=iNij: •Case Reporting Rate, j; In order to estimate the local fraction of COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum cases that are reported in the historical data, OCHA- Bucky uses a method similar to Russel et al. [/one.pnum6] based on the deviation from the expected CFR. Using the derived CFR and the historical case and death data, the OCHA-Bucky model /uniFB01rst estimates the overall case reporting rate for symptomatic cases at the ADM/two.pnum level. This is done using the assumption that the ratio of the expected CFR for each region based on the local demographics, jto the CFR calculated from the cumulative historical data, hist j/two.pnumi.e. j=j hist j=iNij hist j: In calculating data j, a lag in the reporting of deaths equal to the given input parameter is assumed ??. The estimated case reporting rate for each of the last X number of days is then calculated; the mean value in each region is used. •Doubling Time, TD; /one.pnumThroughout our discussion in this section we make use of Einstein notation[/one.pnum/four.pnum] to describe the mathematics. This is owed to the fact that most of the variables are tensors by virtue of the fact that they are strati/uniFB01ed in multiple ways (e.g., age and locality) Most importantly, we use the notation of a tensor contraction to represent the summed multiplication along an axis. i.e. cixi=P icixifor all indices that appear as both upper and lower indices in a single term but are otherwise unde/uniFB01ned. /two.pnumIn OCHA-Bucky, the the value is the CFR derived from the historical data, hist jis estimated at the the country level from the WHO country level case/death history and used uniformly throughout all sub-regions. This is done to circumvent potential data issues present in the local case data in various countries.

Rather then explicitly include a parameter controlling the transmission rate, Bucky uses the recent historical data to estimate transmission at the local level/three.pnum. The local doubling time TD;jis estimated by /uniFB01rst considering the historical data prior to the date in which the simulation will begin. Historical data is used to calculate the doubling time for the seven days prior to simulation. These historical doubling times are then averaged to yield the value of TD;jfor a particular simulation. Once these values are calculated, methods similar to those described in [/one.pnum/seven.pnum] can be used to estimate the latent period, 1=, infectious period, 1=, as well as an estimate of the effective R0value. These methods also yield the shape parameters of the gamma-distributions corresponding to E, Iasym, Imild, and Ihosp compartments. •Case Hospitalization Ratio with Vulnerability, i(j); To account for the inclusion of the vulnerability index in OCHA-Bucky, we rescale the population frac- tion requiring healthcare support (the CHR, i) based on the local fraction of vulnerable population, j: i(j) = (1  j)i+Vji whereVis the relative severity among the vulnerable population (See /two.pnum./three.pnum./two.pnum for how this is estimated). •Contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals, ij; The quantity ijrepresents the average number of contacts per person per time, multiplied by the prob- ability of disease transmission in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject. Within Bucky, this consists of the rate that an individual in age group iin locationjgets infected by the virus. This depends on three quantities: /one.pnum. The infectivity rate of the virus; /two.pnum. The average contact between someone from age group iand individuals across all other age groups; /three.pnum. The average rate of mobility into location jfrom across all other locations in the simulation. /two.pnum./three.pnum Data Sources /two.pnum./three.pnum./one.pnum Population Data In order to estimate the age- and sex-disaggregated population for each ADM/two.pnum region two different datasets are combined: •Administrative boundaries shape/uniFB01les at the ADM/two.pnum level from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX); •United Nations -adjusted WorldPop age and sex disaggregated population raster data. Input consists of raster data with the administrative region polygons for the province/state (ADM/one.pnum) and district/county (ADM/two.pnum) to get total populations for each region, strati/uniFB01ed by age and sex. Then, values are scaled so that the total population is consistent with the regional UN-adjusted population. /two.pnum./three.pnum./two.pnum Vulnerability Parameters The fraction of the population in an ADM/two.pnum region that is particularly vulnerable to COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum is estimated by calculating the proportion of the population effected by those factors described in Sections /two.pnum./three.pnum./two.pnum./one.pnum – /two.pnum./three.pnum./two.pnum./four.pnum. To avoid confounding factors contributing to a population’s increased vulnerability, we select the maximum of these proportions and consider this to be the proportion of the population that is at increased vulnerability to the effects of COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum. Those in the population that are considered vulnerable have a higher risk of a severe case or death (and hence a higher CHR and CFR) than non-vulnerable members of a region. Given literature estimates, the vulnerable population is given a CHR that is /one.pnum./five.pnum times greater than the average CHR of a region (calculated via age and gender demographic information)./four.pnum /three.pnumIn OCHA-Bucky, this estimation if performed at the nation level using WHO case data, similar to the estimation of reported CFR. /four.pnumThe CFR carries the CHR scalar multiplication forward since CFR is estimated as a proportion of those with severe cases.

/two.pnum./three.pnum./two.pnum./one.pnum Urban/Rural disaggregation Although not a risk factor on its own, there are several vulnerabilities that scale differently with urban and rural populations. The COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum crisis has impacted urban areas signi/uniFB01cantly more than rural areas, due primarily to mobility and proximity to other ADM/two.pnum regions, which increase transmission rates. Urban/rural strati/uniFB01cation is available in raster format from WorldPop. To calculate the urban-rural fraction for each ADM/two.pnum region, data is taken from Global Human Settlement Layer. Based on the classi/uniFB01cations available in [/one.pnum8] anything denser than suburban (class /two.pnum/one.pnum or above) is considered to be urban, and the rest to be rural. /two.pnum./three.pnum./two.pnum./two.pnum Food insecurity There is evidence that weight impacts the severity of in/uniFB02uenza and other respiratory viruses [/one.pnum/nine.pnum]. We have used food security as an indicator of population weight and other factors that effect the populations base- line ability to respond to respiratory illness. Hence, we scale our our vulnerability factor, jby levels of food security within the region. Food insecurity data is obtained from the Integrated Food Security Phase Clas- si/uniFB01cation (IPC) Global Platform. The proportion of individuals living in regions at IPC level /three.pnum or greater are considered at-risk. The data tend to have a mix of information at the ADM/one.pnum and ADM/two.pnum levels; the most granular data is utilized for this calculation. /two.pnum./three.pnum./two.pnum./three.pnum Indoor air pollution - indoor cooking fuels The use of indoor cooking fuels is a risk factor for COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum whose prevalence depends on an urban or rural setting. Data on the use of solid fuels is obtained from the World Health Organization. The total fraction of the population using solid fuels is calculated by re-scaling at each location the urban/rural estimates from WHO by the corresponding urban/rural population fraction estimated according to /two.pnum./three.pnum./two.pnum./one.pnum. There is evidence linking indoor air pollution and respiratory illness [/two.pnum/zero.pnum]. Based on the available literature, we estimated that those that used solid cooking fuels are /one.pnum.8 times more likely to develop a severe infection. /two.pnum./three.pnum./two.pnum./four.pnum Medical comorbidities Medical co-morbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and tuberculosis, were considered as pos- sible additional vulnerability parameters for cases and deaths. However, the OCHA-Bucky model does not use these parameters, as they are highly correlated with age and gender, and have little additional impact on vulnerability and death rate estimates. /two.pnum./three.pnum./three.pnum Mobility Data and Matrix Generation A required input of the model is the amount of interaction that occurs between different regions at the sub- national level. Mobility matrix data is used to simulate disease spread across different administrative units of a country. The JHUAPL-Bucky model assumes contact between various regions through using a combi- nation of various sources of cell-phone based mobility estimates. In the OCHA-Bucky model, due to a lack of mobile phone based estimates, contact between ADM/two.pnum regions is approximated through an analysis of road network data. Road density data from Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOTOSM) is used to estimate the strength of the connection between all ADM/two.pnum regions considered. To create the mobility matrix using roads data, a roads shape/uniFB01le is read, and roads that intersect with at least one ADM/two.pnum border are kept. For each road, a list is then created of which ADM/two.pnum regions the road passes through. Completing this gives a list of region to re- gion pairs, for which geographic distance (between ADM/two.pnum geographic centroids) and road connectivity are calculated. To calculate road connectivity, road network lines are obtained from HOTOSM on HDX. The road classi/uniFB01cation system from HOTOSM is used to apply weights for each road type, calculated by multiplying the estimated typical speed and number of lanes for each road class; connectivity is de/uniFB01ned as the sum of all roads connecting the region pair. Road connectivity, the motor vehicle ownership fraction, and the reciprocal geographic distance between regions are all then multiplied together to give estimates of connectivity between ADM/two.pnum pairs. Adjacent regions with many large road connections necessarily have higher connectivity values than those which have few small or even no road connections. Long-range or non-adjacent interactions between regions are also considered, especially in cases where a road crosses more than two regional boundaries. However, the diminishing weakness of non-adjacent ADM/two.pnum pairs is captured through the reciprocal of the geographic The Centre for Humanitarian Data centre.humdata.org | Join our mailing list: bit.ly/humdatamailing | Twitter: @humdata | Email: centrehumdata@un.org /one.pnum/zero.pnum

centroids; higher values indicate closer regions. Within the model, the probability of the disease to spread from one ADM/two.pnum region to another is proportional to the estimated weights in the mobility matrix. /two.pnum./three.pnum./four.pnum COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum Cases and Deaths Sub-national historical daily number of COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum cases are obtained from HDX. In most countries of interest, the source for COVID case counts is the nation’s Ministry of Public Health. Additional federal (ADM/zero.pnum) histor- ical data is also obtained from the WHO. Data is usually available at the ADM/one.pnum level. To obtain ADM/two.pnum-level case counts, ADM/one.pnum case counts are scaled using the ADM/two.pnum population. /two.pnum./three.pnum./five.pnum Contact Matrix Contact matrices quantify how much people from different age groups interact, and are extracted from Prem et al. [/two.pnum/one.pnum]. The contact matrices used are taken from the home, school, work, and other locations. For some countries, the contact matrix is not directly available. In these instances, a country in the same region and with similar socioeconomic indicators is used as a proxy./five.pnum /two.pnum./three.pnum.6 Non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) NPIs are mitigations, apart from getting vaccinated and taking medicine, that people and communities can take to help slow the spread of communicable diseases. As a vaccine for COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum has yet to be deployed, NPIs are among the the best strategies for controlling the spread of the current COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum virus. The struc- ture of the OCHA-Bucky model allows for the incorporation of NPIs via the modi/uniFB01cation of a combination of the following : the basic reproduction number, local contact matrices, and inter-regional mobility matrices. For each country an initial list of NPIs was obtained from the ACAPS COVID-/one.pnum/nine.pnum Government Measures Dataset. This dataset is complemented with additional qualitative information from in-country stakeholders. The estimated compliance level are tailored to speci/uniFB01c countries. /two.pnum./three.pnum.6./one.pnum Implementation of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions NPIs are categorized and implemented in OCHA-Bucky based on their classi/uniFB01cation into three categories: /one.pnum. Contact-Matrix Based NPIs; These NPIs are those that effect only certain age groups within the total population. These NPI effect the ratios relating the components of the contact matrices. The NPI that fall under this category are: •School closure •Shielding elderly /two.pnum. Mobility Based NPI; This classi/uniFB01cation is for those NPI that lead to changes in mobility/movement between administra- tive districts (as opposed to movement within an administrative district). The NPI that fall under this category are : •Closing of borders, ports, and/or international /uniFB02ights •Restricting inter-regional movement /three.pnum. Reproduction Number Based NPI; This classi/uniFB01cation is for those NPI that have an effect on the overall scaling of transmissibility. It encompasses both intra-regional measures to reduce transmission as well as national level initiatives designed to reduce transmission throughout the country. The NPI that fall under this category are : •Social distancing; /five.pnumThe model from The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine also utilizes this strategy.

•Face mask wearing; •Installation of hand washing stations; •Reduction of size of public gatherings; •Closing businesses; •Partial lockdown; •Awareness campaigns (e.g., vaccination programs). A summary of the NPIs that are currently implemented in OCHA-Bucky are given in Table /three.pnum. This table in- cludes the classi/uniFB01cation, effects, and sources that are currently being used to approximate the effects of various NPI. With the current implementation, we have the ability to distinguish between the effects of NPI within the categories mentioned above. For the case in which multiple NPI within category III are implemented, we have implemented a value-added approach to calculating their effectiveness in reducing the basic repro- duction number. In this case, we calculate the reduction in R0based on the number of NPIs in place. If /one.pnum NPI is in place, R0is reduced by /four.pnum/zero.pnum%. If /two.pnum NPI are in place, R0is reduced by 6/zero.pnum%. If /three.pnum or more NPI are in place, thenR0is reduced by /seven.pnum/zero.pnum%.

This will serve as the initial state of our simulation. As output, OCHA-Bucky generates one data /uniFB01le per Monte Carlo run. The /uniFB01les contain data at the ADM/two.pnum level and are indexed by data and run ID. This data is post-processed to combine data across all the dates and simulations. It can then be aggregated at desired geographic levels. A separate /uniFB01le is created for each administrative level, with each row indexed by date, admin ID, and quantile. The columns of this output /uniFB01le are described in Table /four.pnum.
