459 Environmental Protection Agency § 141.76 (E) Number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is not measured and HPC is >500/ml; (F) For the current and previous month the system serves water to the public, the value of ‘‘V’’ in the following formula: Vcde ab=++ +×100 where: a=the value in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, b=the value in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, c=the value in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this section, d=the value in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, and e=the value in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(E) of this section. (G) If the State determines, based on site-specific considerations, that a sys-tem has no means for having a sample transported and analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory within the req-uisite time and temperature conditions specified by §141.74(a)(3) and that the system is providing adequate disinfec-tion in the distribution system, the re-quirements of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) (A)– (F) of this section do not apply. (iv) A system need not report the data listed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section if all data listed in paragraphs (b)(2) (i)–(iii) of this section remain on file at the system and the State deter-mines that the system has submitted all the information required by para-graphs (b)(2) (i)–(iii) of this section for at least 12 months. (3)(i) Each system, upon discovering that a waterborne disease outbreak po-tentially attributable to that water system has occurred, must report that occurrence to the State as soon as pos-sible, but no later than by the end of the next business day. (ii) If at any time the turbidity ex- ceeds 5 NTU, the system must consult with the primacy agency as soon as practical, but no later than 24 hours after the exceedance is known, in ac-cordance with the public notification requirements under §141.203(b)(3). (iii) If at any time the residual falls below 0.2 mg/l in the water entering the distribution system, the system must notify the State as soon as possible, but no later than by the end of the next business day. The system also must no-tify the State by the end of the next business day whether or not the resid-ual was restored to at least 0.2 mg/l within 4 hours. [54 FR 27527, June 29, 1989, as amended at 65 FR 26022, May 4, 2000] EFFECTIVE DATENOTE: At 69 FR 38856, June 29, 2004, §141.75 was amended in paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(G) by removing the citation ‘‘§141.74(a)(3) ’’ and adding in its place ‘‘§141.74(a)(1) ’’, and in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(G) by removing the citation ‘‘§141.74(a)(3) ’’ and adding in its place ‘‘§141.74(a)(1) ’’, effective July 29, 2004. § 141.76 Recycle provisions. (a) Applicability. All subpart H sys- tems that employ conventional filtra-tion or direct filtration treatment and that recycle spent filter backwash water, thickener supernatant, or liq-uids from dewatering processes must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. (b) Reporting. A system must notify the State in writing by Decemeber 8, 2003, if the system recycles spent filter backwash water, thickener super-natant, or liquids from dewatering processes. This notification must in-clude, at a minimum, the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. (1) A plant schematic showing the or- igin of all flows which are recycled (in-cluding, but not limited to, spent filter backwash water, thickener super-natant, and liquids from dewatering processes), the hydraulic conveyance used to transport them, and the loca-tion where they are re-introduced back into the treatment plant. (2) Typical recycle flow in gallons per minute (gpm), the highest observed plant flow experienced in the previous year (gpm), design flow for the treat-ment plant (gpm), and State-approved operating capacity for the plant where the State has made such determina-tions. (c) Treatment technique requirement. Any system that recycles spent filter backwash water, thickener super-natant, or liquids from dewatering processes must return these flows through the processes of a system’s ex-isting conventional or direct filtration VerDate May<21>2004 03:50 Aug 06, 2004 Jkt 203160 PO 00000 Frm 00459 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Y:\SGML\203160T.XXX 203160T EC15NO91.137</MATH>

460 40 CFR Ch. I (7–1–04 Edition) § 141.80 system as defined in §141.2 or at an al- ternate location approved by the State by June 8, 2004. If capital improve-ments are required to modify the recy-cle location to meet this requirement, all capital improvements must be com-pleted no later than June 8, 2006. (d) Recordkeeping. The system must collect and retain on file recycle flow information specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (6) of this section for re-view and evaluation by the State be-ginning June 8, 2004. (1) Copy of the recycle notification and information submitted to the State under paragraph (b) of this sec-tion. (2) List of all recycle flows and the frequency with which they are re-turned. (3) Average and maximum backwash flow rate through the filters and the average and maximum duration of the filter backwash process in minutes. (4) Typical filter run length and a written summary of how filter run length is determined. (5) The type of treatment provided for the recycle flow. (6) Data on the physical dimensions of the equalization and/or treatment units, typical and maximum hydraulic loading rates, type of treatment chemi-cals used and average dose and fre-quency of use, and frequency at which solids are removed, if applicable. [66 FR 31103, June 8, 2001] Subpart I—Control of Lead and Copper SOURCE : 56 FR 26548, June 7, 1991, unless otherwise noted. § 141.80 General requirements. (a) Applicability and effective dates. (1) The requirements of this subpart I con-stitute the national primary drinking water regulations for lead and copper. Unless otherwise indicated, each of the provisions of this subpart applies to community water systems and non- transient, non-community water sys-tems (hereinafter referred to as ‘‘water systems ’’ or ‘‘systems ’’). (2) The requirements set forth in §§141.86 to 141.91 shall take effect on July 7, 1991. The requirements set forth in §§141.80 to 141.85 shall take effect on December 7, 1992. (b) Scope. These regulations establish a treatment technique that includes re-quirements for corrosion control treat-ment, source water treatment, lead service line replacement, and public education. These requirements are triggered, in some cases, by lead and copper action levels measured in sam-ples collected at consumers’ taps. (c) Lead and copper action levels. (1) The lead action level is exceeded if the concentration of lead in more than 10 percent of tap water samples collected during any monitoring period con-ducted in accordance with §141.86 is greater than 0.015 mg/L (i.e., if the ‘‘90th percentile ’’ lead level is greater than 0.015 mg/L). (2) The copper action level is exceed- ed if the concentration of copper in more than 10 percent of tap water sam-ples collected during any monitoring period conducted in accordance with §141.86 is greater than 1.3 mg/L (i.e., if the ‘‘90th percentile ’’ copper level is greater than 1.3 mg/L). (3) The 90th percentile lead and cop- per levels shall be computed as follows: (i) The results of all lead or copper samples taken during a monitoring pe-riod shall be placed in ascending order from the sample with the lowest con-centration to the sample with the high-est concentration. Each sampling re-sult shall be assigned a number, as-cending by single integers beginning with the number 1 for the sample with the lowest contaminant level. The number assigned to the sample with the highest contaminant level shall be equal to the total number of samples taken. (ii) The number of samples taken during the monitoring period shall be multiplied by 0.9. (iii) The contaminant concentration in the numbered sample yielded by the calculation in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) is the 90th percentile contaminant level. (iv) For water systems serving fewer than 100 people that collect 5 samples per monitoring period, the 90th per-centile is computed by taking the aver-age of the highest and second highest concentrations.
