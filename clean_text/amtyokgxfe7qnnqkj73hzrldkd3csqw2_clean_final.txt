IntroductionTo Algebra The amount when the interest and the principal iscompounded annually is:A = P(1 + .Solve for the principal (P). At simple interest, the amount after n years isthe principal multiplied by the quantity: one plusthe number of years times the interest rate. Expressas an algebraic expression. For efficient evaluation of a polynomial, theoperations can be nested as follows:y=(Ex + D)x +Cx +B x+ AExpand this expression to show the form of thepolynomial. The volume of a cylindrical tank with hemisphericalends can be expressed in terms of the diameter.ofthe tank and the length of the cylindrical portion.The volume is equal to the quantity: the lengthplus 3 the diameter multiplied by pi times thediameter squared divided by 4.
