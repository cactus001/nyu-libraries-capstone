Within sixty-three (63) days after such notice is m ailed, the taxpayer may, at his option, file a protes t in writing with the state tax commission and obtain redeterm ination of the deficiency. The taxpayer did not respond to correspondence. Therefore, the Bureau issued a Notice of Deficiency Determ ination. In response to the notice, the taxpayer sent a letter of appeal. He said he was di sputing the determ ination because he was m arried and had two m inor children living with him during both of the years at issue. He included a da te of birth and a social security num ber for his wife and each child. In addition, he said the actual 1997 incom e amount was less than the am ount the Bureau used to determ ine the Idaho tax due for that year. The taxpayer furnished no further inform ation. The Bureau expanded its research to determ ine the accuracy of the taxpayer’s claim s. Because the inform ation provided by the taxpayer appear ed to be m ore accurate than the information used to prepare the deficiency notice, the Bureau sent the taxpayer a revised determ ination. The amended determ ination did not include a deficien cy for 1997 becau se the new computation resulted in no tax due. The Bureau advised the taxpayer the determ ination of a deficiency for 1997 was canceled and asked him to accept the revised am ounts for 1996. The taxpayer did not respond and his file was transferred to the Legal/Tax Policy Division for adm inistrative review. On April 12, 2002, the Tax Com mission received th e taxpayer’s Idaho returns for the years 1997, 1998, and 1999 along with a letter that was signed by the taxpayer. In the letter, the taxpayer said he had decided to withdraw his protest regarding the 1996 tax year and accept the Bureau’s revised determ ination of tax due. Secondly, the taxpayer asked to have the re fund shown in his 1997 Idaho return applied against his 1996 liability. He said he was not aware of a statute that allows a taxing authority to withhold refunds while continuing to collect taxes beyond a specific tim e fram e. DECISION -2 [Redacted]
