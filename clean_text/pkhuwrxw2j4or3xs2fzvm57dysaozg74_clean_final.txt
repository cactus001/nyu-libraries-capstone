In the objection the debtor s’ counsel stated: The debtor s received no payment advices of the kind described in and required to be filed under 11 U.S.C. § 521(a). Contrary to the trustee’s assertion, there is no requirement that debtors file a declarat ion regarding the lack of such payment advices under the statute, Federal Bankruptcy Rules, or Local Bankruptcy Rules. The debtor s’ schedules , Statement of Financial Affairs , and Chapter 13 Statement of Current Monthly Income each provide statements that are verified pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1008 and provide evidence that there are no payment advices that need to be filed in this case. On June 18, 2014, the trustee filed a response to the debtor s’ objection (ECF No. 4 1). In the response, the trustee cited 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B)(iv) for the proposition that the debtors are required to file copies of payment advices; however, the trustee cited no c ode section, rule, or other authority for the proposition that a debtor is req uired to file a declaration where there are no payment advices available for filing. On June 24, 2014, the trustee filed a report that there were no objections to confirmation of the debtor s’ chapter 13 plan, and in that report the trus tee 14-01533-FPC13 Doc 60 Filed 08/01/14 Entered 08/01/14 13:21:09 Pg 3 of 5

On June 25, 2014 , the debtor s’ plan was confirmed (ECF No. 51). On July 28, 2014, the trustee filed a supplemental reply in support of his motion to dismiss the debtor s’ case (ECF No. 5 5). In the supplemental reply, the trustee asserted for the first time that the debtor s are required by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4002(b)(2) to provide a written statement that payment advices do not exist or are not in the debtor s’ possession. In the supplemental reply, the trustee quotes the Advisory Committee Notes to the 2008 amendments to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4002(b)(2) to support the assertion that debtors are required to cooperate and provide the requested documents; however, the quoted paragraph also provide s: Subdivision (b)(2) does not require that the debtor create documents or obtain documents from third parties; rather, the debtor's obligation is to bring to the m eeting of creditors under §341 the documents which the debtor possesses. The continuation of the trustee’s effort to dismiss the debtor s’ case is inconsistent with the trustee’s recommendation that the debtor s’ plan be confirmed. The debtor s have satisfied all of their reporting obligations with respect to payment advices. 14-01533-FPC13 Doc 60 Filed 08/01/14 Entered 08/01/14 13:21:09 Pg 4 of 5
