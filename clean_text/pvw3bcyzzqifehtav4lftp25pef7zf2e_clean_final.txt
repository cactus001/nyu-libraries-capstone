43Internal Revenue Service, Treasury § 1.853–2 value of its total assets, at the close of the taxable year for which the election is made, invested in stocks and securi- ties of foreign corporations, and (2) must also, for that year, comply with the requirements prescribed in section 852(a) and paragraph (a) of §1.852–1. The term ‘‘value’’, for purposes of the first requirement, is defined in section 851(c)(4). For the definition of foreign corporation, see section 7701(a). § 1.853–2 Effect of election. (a) Regulated investment company. A regulated investment company making a valid election with respect to a tax-able year under the provisions of sec-tion 853(a) is, for such year, denied both the deduction for foreign taxes provided by section 164(a) and the cred-it for foreign taxes provided by section 901 with respect to all income, war-profits, and excess profits taxes (de-scribed in section 901(b)(1)) which it has paid to any foreign country or posses-sion of the United States. See section 853(b)(1)(A). However, under section 853(b)(1)(B), the regulated investment company is permitted to add the amount of such foreign taxes paid to its dividends paid deduction for that taxable year. See paragraph (a) of §1.852–1. (b) Shareholder. Under section 853(b)(2), a shareholder of an invest-ment company, which has made the election under section 853, is, in effect, placed in the same position as a person directly owning stock in foreign cor-porations, in that he must include in his gross income (in addition to taxable dividends actually received) his propor-tionate share of such foreign taxes paid and must treat such amount as foreign taxes paid by him for the purposes of the deduction under section 164(a) and the credit under section 901. For such purposes he must treat as gross income from a foreign country or possession of the United States (1) his proportionate share of the taxes paid by the regulated investment company to such foreign country or possession and (2) the por-tion of any dividend paid by the invest-ment company which represents in-come derived from such sources. (c) Dividends paid after the close of the taxable year. For additional rules appli- cable to certain distributions made after the close of the taxable year which may be designated as income re-ceived from sources within and taxes paid to foreign countries or possessions of the United States, see section 855(d) and paragraph (f) of §1.855–1.

(4) The X Corporation meets the 50 percent requirement of section 851(b)(4) and the requirements of section 852(a). It notifies each shareholder by mail, within the time prescribed by section 853(c), that by reason of the election they are to treat as foreign taxes paid $0.30 per share of stock ($75,000 of for-eign taxes paid, divided by the 250,000 shares of stock outstanding), of which $0.20 represents taxes paid to Country B and $0.10 taxes paid to Country A. The shareholders must report as in-come $2.88 per share ($2.58 of dividends actually received plus the $0.30 rep-resenting foreign taxes paid). Of the $2.88 per share, $1.80 per share ($450,000 VerDate jul<14>2003 08:23 Jun 10, 2004 Jkt 203090 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\203090T.XXX 203090T
