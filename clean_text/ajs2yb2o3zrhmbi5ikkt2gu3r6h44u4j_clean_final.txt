k, IILILLLCIP/The George Washington University Information Line SPRING/SUMMER 1994 VOL. 2, No. 1SPOTLIGHT ON TRAINING STRATEGIESFOLLOW-UP: A KEY COMPONENT OF SUCCESSFUL TRAINING Dr. Barbara Wolfe, a trainer-of-trainers exemplar,is currently on the faculty of the Department ofSpecial Education at the University of Wiscon-sin-Eau Claire. Prior to university teaching, she spentfifteen years providing inservice training on inclusion toearly childhood professionals. We would like to share someof Barbara's thoughts on training gleaned from a recenttelephone interview.You have conducted research on best practices ininservice education. What did you find most helpedteachers implement new ideas in their classrooms?Factors that most helped teachers use new ideas in theirclassroom were (1) useful handouts/materials, (2) relevantcontent that addressed an existing need. (3) follow-upsupport, (4) practical content that could be applied immedi-ately and (5) an effective trainer.Did any of these findings surprise you?Two were surprisingthe importance of handouts (i.e.practical. relevant handouts) and the impact of the traineron inservice outcomes. Participants defined effectivetrainers as knowledgeable, well prepared, credible, enthusi-astic and able to use a variety of techniques includinghands-on and interactive strategies. The good news aboutthese characteristics is that people can learn themthat is.training isn't an inherent trait but rather a learned skill.Let's talk for a minute about follow-up support. Couldyou define what you mean by follow-up?Broadly speaking, follow-up can be defined as strate-gies and events that take place following the plannedworkshop experience. Some examples are a "back home"plan to try on the job, a follow-up class or workshop, on-site coaching by peers or trainers or a follow-up letter withresource articles.Why do you think follow-up is so important ininservice education?Learning is a process, not something that happens in aone-time training event. Change takes place over time andrequires a focused effort for new ideas to be integrated intoongoing practice. Follow-up provides a strategy for focusedeffort over time, thereby increasing the chance that newideas will actually become on-the-job behaviors.What follow-up strategies have you found to be mosteffective?In my research, not too many participants had experi-enced follow-up but those who had preferred (1) observingsomeone else demonstrating the new idea, (2) having on-the-job assistance or (3) participating in small groupdiscussions with fellow staff or an administrator.Two other specific follow-up strategies that can beoffered to participants on a voluntary basis are: (1) coach-ing (peer or expert coaching) which is a labor intensive,one-on-one strategy where the coach serves as a mirrorthrough which the teacher can examine her behavior, and(2) peer support group which brings participants backtogether to talk about the successes they have experiencedand to brainstorm solutions that support implementationefforts.Earlier you spoke of "back home" plans as a follow-up strategy. Can you expand on that?A "back home" plan is like a personal learning plan. Itis a good strategy for intensive full-day or multi-dayclasses. Each individual completes a plan indicatingpersonal goals, what they will do to accomplish their goals,and possibly, products that will demonstrate accomplish-ment. Trainers can get feedback on the participants'progress toward their goals by doing follow-up visits,calling the site, or requesting video or written records.It is sometimes difficult to motivate participants tocomplete a back home plan after a long training day, so Ihave tried using an "Aha" sheet where participants writedown new ideas throughout the session. Then when theymake their plan, I have them limit their ideas to 3 or 4things to try at home. We usually take up to a half-hour atthe end of the training course to develop an individual orteam "back home" plan. Carry-over is sometimes increasedby having participants verbally report their plan to someoneelse, or to the whole group. Somehow when you say italoud, you feel more committed to action.Is there anything else you would like to say?Helping teachers learn new skills and incorporate theminto the classroom requires an intensive system of trainingthat utilizes multiple training strategies, including opportu-nities to observe, practice, receive feedback and talk aboutthe ideas. It is paramount that administrators are committedto both the ideas being presented and the training design,which might require an increase in release time for training,planning or peer support. 3For more information contact:Dr. Barbara WolfeDepartment of Special EducationUniversity of Wisconsin-Eau ClaireEau Claire, WI 54701BEST COPY AVAILABLE

PAGE 2 INCLUSION FORUM SPRING/SUMMER 1994EMPOWERING PARENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN INCLUSION TRAINING Arecent NorthCarolina projecttrained parents ofchildren with disabilities toserve as inclusion specialiststhrough41%,, kdevelopingPartnershipsfor Inclusionskills andadvocacyparticipating ininclusion training forday care and other providers of services to children. Thistraining, designed and conducted primarily by experi-enced parent advocates, was funded by the Partnershipsfor Inclusion Project at the Frank Porter Graham ChildDevelopment Center at the University of North CarolinaChapel Hill.The parents participating in the project represented avariety of socio-economic and family backgrounds, hadchildren with different disabilities, and were locatedthroughout the state. The parents agreed to participate ina two-day training session and follow-up activities.Expenses and a small honorarium were given to partici-pants.The training sessions and follow-up activities weredesigned to develop the participants' advocacy andpresentation skills by focusing on the following:a working knowledge of the state's service deliverysystem;the ability to effectively present a personalizedrationale for inclusion;a working knowledge of the basic rights of childrenwith disabilities;the ability to work effectively within the system inadvocating for inclusion.Several of the sessions focused on giving parents avariety of "tools" to present their unique perspective oninclusion. Topics included incorporating humor,children's books and artwork, visual images and adulteducation principles to support presentations. Adultlearning principles included giving audiences informa-tion they could use (relevance), showing how theinformation could be used to solve problems (practical-ity) and convincing audiences of the need to learn(motivation).The parents left the two-day training with an "indi-vidualized education plan" to help develop their presen-tations. This written plan outlined the presentationpieces that were in place, i.e., the "strengths," and thepieces that needed to be developed, i.e., the "needs." Asfollow up, smaller groups met with one of the parentadvocates. At these sessions, each parent trainee give apresentation. The other trainees and the parent-advocateacted as an audience of professionals who critiqued eachpresentation. This role playing helped prepare thetrainees to present information before live audiences andto answer probing questions. The inclusion specialistsnow serve to link the parents to day care and relatedtraining programs across North Carolina.For more information contact:Ralph C.

Its positiveresults for children,families and providers have led to subsequent projects toassist preschool personnel in serving children withdisabilities. One of the biggest challenges facing com-munity program inclusion efforts is providing the helpthat is needed when it is needed. Although trainingtypically addresses many of the providers' anticipatedneeds, unanticipated needs inevitably arise as servicesare delivered to children and families.To respond to providers' needs in a timely manner,we have found no substitute for "being there." Whensomeone with special expertise in serving children withdisabilities and their families is present on a daily basis,she/he can most easily develop the working relationshipsnecessary to help teams provide effective services.Although on-site support is our preferred form oftechnical assistance, we must often seek alternatives dueto factors such as time and distance. After a goodworking relationship has been established, an itinerantperson can offer assistance using telecommunication Li

It is committed to supporting childcare personnel in their collaboration with other serviceproviders to meet the needs of all children in inclusive_re*MMENITYNNECTIONS NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT options such as the telephone. For example, duringa weekly phone call to each site, the SIP consultantand provider reviewed each child's progress andtogether sought solutions to problems.But sometimes a picture is needed to establishthe context in which the problem occurs. Twostrategies have proven advantageous in this situa-tion. One is to "dialogue" through a videotapeexchange. First, the provider makes a video demon-strating the problem and then the trainer respondsby making a video that demonstrates an alternativepractice. In the Early Ed Project, video exchangehelped providers increase child engagement insmall group activities by demonstrating alternativestrategies for child-adult interactions.Another strategy, interactive television, allowsall parties to see what is happening as well as totalk about it. Using the state's educational televi-sion network, a speech and language pathologist ina television studio watched two children in pre-schools several hundred miles away. She gave theproviders suggestions to stimulate language andthen followed up weekly through videotape ex-change. These alternatives allow us to deliverpersonalized help in a timely manner withoutspending hours traveling from program to program.For more information contact:Sarah RuleCenter for Persons with DisabilitiesUtah State UniversityLogan, UT 84322-6805settings.As training begins, the firstissue addressed is the partici-pants' attitudes and valuesabout disabilities. Addressingattitudes and values first givesparticipants the opportunity totalk about their fears andhopes, Trainees are asked to think about inclusion froma personal perspective by remembering and describing atime in their lives when they wanted to belong and feltexcluded. People describe powerful childhood memoriesabout being ridiculed in kindergarten, being excludedfrom a team, and/or being teased about their ethnicity.Through this exercise they remember the hurt of exclu-sion and they begin to empathize with the feelings ofchildren in their care.Next, participants complete a survey that asks themto rate their responses to a series of statements aboutinclusion such as: E3The parents of a child with disabilities should be ableto decide what placement and services their childreceives.O For most children with disabilities inclusion worksonly if there is extra adult help.CI Inclusion is good for children with disabilities but theother children usually do not benefit.Teaching children with disabilities is much harder thanteaching typical children.O Some children would be better off in separate morespecialized settings.The group then discusses the range of responses. Be-cause there are no right or wrong answers, this exercisehelps people clarify their own values and beliefs andshare their thinking with their colleagues. Teaming isvital to the success of inclusion and this exercise alsohelps the trainees understand and respect the values andbeliefs of their team members.By working through this process of examining andexperiencing the power of attitudes and values aboutdisabilities, the teams come to a common core of beliefsabout inclusion. Team members then write a missionstatement that will serve to guide their goals and activi-ties as they plan for inclusion.For more information contact:Y.

CIP/The George Washington University Information LineFALL/WINTER 1994 Vol.. 2, No. 2SPOTLIGHT ON COLLABORATIONBUILDING A VISION FOR COLLABORATIONAs communities strive to increase inclusiveoptions in early childhood education, the needto pull together fragmented systems has raisednew issues for planners and practitioners. Rejoining afragmented system is not an easy task. Typically, acommunity may begin by establishing an interagencygroup with the mission of coordinating services tofamilies. This type of cooperative initiative simplycoordinates existing services and offers a reasonablestarting point for change. However, in localities wherethe need and intent is to fundamentally change the waysservices are designed and delivered, acollaborative strategy will be necessary(Melaville and Blank, 1991). Whether apartnership will be collaborative or coopera-tive in nature depends on "how far partnerswish to move beyond the status quo"(Melaville and Blank, 1991).The existence of a common goal orvision supports the notion of fundamentalchange and is a defining feature of a truecollaboration. A shared vision requiresthat collaborating parties express their personal beliefsand build consensus around the issue they wish toaddress. Participants in this process are challenged totranscend their traditional roles and answer the question"What do we want to create?" rather than "What do wethink we can do?". As service delivery barriers arebroken down, there is an opportunity to create aninclusive vision and to have a collaboration where thewhole becomes greater than the sum of the parts. Senge(1990) in his book The Fifth Discipline, states that ashared vision can "create the spark, the excitement thatlifts an organization out of the mundane, . .. compelcourage so naturally that people don't even realize theextent of their courage. . .foster risk taking andexperimentation."Collaboration may not always start with a clearvision, but rather begin with a sense that somethingneeds to happen differently. The vision may not beclearly articulated for some time. Vandercook, Yorkand Sullivan (1993) warn that engaging in a long-termcommitment without taking the time to build relation-ships can be futile. Collaborations are fostered byencouraging participants to work together on smallprojects: offering opportunities to share philosophies,learning to communicate effectively and experiencingsmall successes. Collaboration is basically a people-to-people process. It is essential to create strong bonds andmutual respect between the collaborative partners as afirst step in building a shared vision.Creating a meaningful vision is an exciting andchallenging task. To effectively sustain the commitmentof the collaborative partners to change, a shared visionmust include the deeply personal visions of eachparticipant as well as mutually held beliefs. When thishappens, a vision will be seen as both "my vision" and"our vision" (Senge, 1990). Rowe (1992), developer of avision-driven, decision-making model for schoolrestructunng, suggests that change requires visions that(1) are compelling, (2) are clear and (3) can be assessed."We will send a man to the moon in this decade" is aclassic statement of a vision that exemplifiesthese criteria. So too are the visions "allchildren can learn" or "all children can learnin school environments that are fullyinclusive." Shared vision statementssuch as these can change the way aschool system does business.Collaboration is a process: it is not an end in itself.A collaborative effort will look different each time it isimplemented. A specific model of collaboration cannotbe "parachuted" into a state, community or classroom. Itmust be responsive to the culture of each new location(Blank and Lombardi, 1991).

PAGE 2 INCLUSION FORUM FALL/WINTER 1994COLLABORATION:An Interpersonal Effort Meeting House Cooperative Preschool is aprivate community preschool in Alexandria,Virginia. Since 1991, the school, incollaboration with the Alexandria City Public Schools,has offered inclusive placements for children withdisabilities. These children and their teachers areprovided support by a special educator from theschool system, who is on site at least two days perweek. Partnerships between the regular and specialeducators require a variety of skills. In particular,three interpersonal skills have facilitatedcollaboration: communication, flexibility andsupport.Building rapport is an essential first step inestablishing good communication. At Meeting House,initial meetings between the regular and specialeducators focused on sharing vital information (e.g.,curriculum, IEPs) and clarifying expectations.Occasionally forms (e.g., role exchange form) wereused to expedite these discussions. In addition, teammembers worked to develop a personal relationship.Limited free time was used to engage in casualconversations about ideas and concerns, helping tostrengthen rapport.Teamwork requires flexibility in both principlesand practices. Regular and special educators oftenview issues that arise in inclusive programs fromdistinct perspectives. Being willing to reflect ondifferences and remain open to adapting one'spractices helps to create a team approach. In oneMeeting House class, a child with disabilities washaving extreme difficulty during circle time. While theclassroom teacher did not want this child to beseparated, she agreed to the special educator's plan topull the child out of circle time. The time was used tofacilitate skills the child needed to participate in grouptime and eventually he was able to join in circle time.Support among team members is a basicingredient in successful collaborations. When thereare problems to be solved, they are tackled togetherwith each member contributing ideas and resources. Inorder to recognize problems as well as progress, goalsmust be defined. Goals may reflect objectives forchildren or next steps necessary for teamdevelopment. With goals firmly in mind, thechallenges can be identified and addressed, and thesmall steps made toward improvement can beperceived and acknowledged.8Establishing communication, remaining flexible andbeing supportive enabled the Meeting House staff to createa shared vision and meet the challenges the inclusionprogram presents.For more information contact:Joan Wheeler & Beth FedmanMeeting House Cooperative Preschool316 South Royal StreetAlexandria, VA 22314DEVELOPING COLLA:.To Promote Inc community teamsThe Inclusion throughTransdisciplinary Teamproject (ITT) at theUniversity of Idaho providestechnical assistance tocommunities of professionalsand parents who strive topromote inclusive lives forall young children.

The Welcome Everywhere projectsupports building local capacity for inclusion through (1)administrative commitment, (2) involvement of a variety ofstakeholders and (3) the availability of training and technicalassistance. The project is conducted by the Center forORATIVEORGANIZATIONSlusive Communities Prepare for developing the team: Members learn as much aspossible about each other, including their perceptions. Ways todo this include assuming each others' positions; activelistening exercises; role playing; and sharing perceivedstrengths, weaknesses, opportunities and barriers in regard toefforts toward inclusion.Set the tone for the team: Identify interests common to allmembers through focus groups.Define the team's purpose: Focus on common interests andmutual concerns, not solutions. One wayto do this is by developing a missionstatement.Generate options: Create several optionswhile avoiding obstacles such as prematurejudgment or belief in a single solution. Atthis time, goals should be formalized andprioritized.Evaluate options and reach consensus:Establish criteria for making decisions andinitiate development of action plans.We view team operations as a series ofsequences that occur within the contexts ofteam development and crisis response.These are (1) team formation, (2) storming(exploring different perspectives), (3) settingteam behavior norms, and (4) performance.Finally, we believe that some conflict isgood, as it helps to facilitate team action.For more information contact:Jennifer Olson, Ph.D.Inclusion through Transdisciplinary TeamingIdaho Center on Developmental Disabilities129 West Third StreetUniversity of IdahoMoscow, ID 83843(208) 885-6605StrategiesIncrease knowledgeInvolve in planningOffer financial supportOffer trainingBuild on strengthsUse active listeningExpose to other successfulinclusive communitiesInvolve in planningInsure financial supportAdjust role expectationsEmphasize positiveaspeCts of changeFigure 1 BEST COPYAVAILABLEInnovative Practices for Young Children at the UniversityAffiliated Program of Indiana.A major goal of the project is to promote inclusion ineducation and non-education settings throughout acommunity. This goal has prompted a unique aspect of theprojectthe establishment of local Inclusion Networks.An Inclusion Network is comprised of citizens represent-ing a variety of organizations reflecting each community'sunique strengths and resources. Network membershipusually includes parents, educators, health professionals,social service providers, clergy, business persons and localgovernment officials. The Inclusion Network meets over aperiod of twelve to eighteen months (four or five meet-ings) to carry out the following project-related activities:the development of a Community Vision Statementthe identification of Issues and Barriers to inclusionthe development of Action Plans to address issues andbarriersthe identification of agencies and individuals to receiveInclusion Network informationSpecific formats, tailored to individual communities, arefollowed to facilitate the activities.The success of the Inclusion Networks has beenattributed to several factors, including the opportunity towork with a broad coalition of community members; theopportunity to consider new and different ways to addressissues and barriers; and productive, fast paced meetings.As one participant noted, "It is a unique opportunity toexpand views and promote change-attitudes about childrenwith disabilities and their families can be dramaticallyaltered and gaps can be filled. [It provided] a much neededforum for awareness."The function and outcomes of Inclusion Networksdiffer from formal networks such as local interagencycoordinating councils. By combining existing localassociations and informal/formal networks associated withearly childhood special education programs and agencies,Inclusion Networks have established and promotedinclusive practices across communities. The activities ofeach Network seem to have a ripple effect. Membersindicate they share information with other people in thecommunity. Those members, representing businesses andcommunity organizations, have reported changes made intheir practices to ensure the inclusion of children withdisabilities and their families.For more information contact:Georgia SheriffCenter for Innovative Practices for Young ChildrenInstitute for Study of Developmental Disabilities2853 E. 10th StreetBloomington, IN 47408(812) 855-65089
