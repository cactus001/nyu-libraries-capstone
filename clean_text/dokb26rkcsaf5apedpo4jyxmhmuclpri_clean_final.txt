u F r. UTERI S~~~TESGENERALACCOUY\IT~NG OFFICE 1 REGIONAL OFFICE 1 ROOM 201 413 FIRSTAVENLE NORTH Mr. M. L. Rlaylock Acting Regional Administrator General Services Admxnistratlon GSA Center Auburn, Washington 98002 Dear Mr, Blaylock: We recently completed a survey of the procurement of automobile and truck parts by Federal agenues. The purpose of this letter is to bring to your attention an apparent opportunity for the Federal Supply Service to help agencies achieve savings through the consolidation of prosurements. We found that Federal agencies were purchasmg repax parts from a multitude of suppliers under various methods of procurement, Thus resulted in substantially varying prices for the parts. Some procuring actxvxties were attemptmng to ccnsofidate their require- ments in order to achieve more favorable dzscounts, whzle others were purchasing 8x1 an it=-by-item basis. In no cases, however, did we find that activities were sonsolldating thexr volumes wath other actlvlties to negotiate better prices. As a result of this fra,Pnaented procurement, local agencies were not taking advantage of the potential drscounts available through volume procurement. We examined the prxces paid for automotive parts by two Forest Servxe garages, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Richland, Washington, and five agenczes in the Seattle/Tacoma area maintaining the largest vehxle repair faejellties. The actgvitles included Fort Lewxs9 General Services Admznistratxon (GSA) Hotor Pool, Seattle District Postal Service, NcChord Air Force Base (AFB), and Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS). At each location, we compared przces of replacement parts for general-purpose vehrcles manufactured by Ford, Chrysler, General Motors9 American Motors, and International Harvester.

, Automotive replacement parts can be classzfied rnto two categories--original eqaupment manufacturer's (OEM) parts and alternate parts. OHM parts are sold by the vehicle manufacturer and ats dealers. Alternate parts are sold under different brand names and przce lists than those Identified with the vehule manufacturer. Alternate parts are marketed przmarzly through auto parts stores rather than vehicle dealers. Examples of alternate parts brand names include Flagner, Monroe, Maremont, Echlin, Halley, Carter, and Borg Warner. We compared the prices paid for OEM parts with the pruzes that would have been pald had the part been purchased through nonmandatory Federal Supply Schedules. To provide a common basis for comparison, we related the prices paid for alternate parts to the przces available on the Federal Supply Schedule for an eqtivalent OEM part. An index system was developed whereby the Federal Supply Schedule price was set at a base of 180, The followmng table compares the average prrces paid by the actlvrties vLszted.

Since the contractor bid relatively low on OHM parts and high on alternate parts, separate Indexes for OHM and alternate parts were not comparable. The combined Index was 95, -2-

Thus table shows that AX and the Postal Service obtained the lowest prices for OEX parts and that the Postal Service was charged the lowest prices for alternate parts. We attribute these variances prLmarily to the agencies' selections of sources and methods of procurement. The followzng examples illustrate the wide variances in prices noted during our survey. PSNS generally purchased its alternate parts through blanket purchase agreements, PSNS would have saved 45 percent If these parts could have been purchased under the Postal Sexplce's local term contract. As an example, PSNS purchased a Carter carburetor for a Dodge truck from an alternate parts supplier, who was not required to deliver, at a cost of $31.08. This same part was available through the Postal Service's local contract at a cost of $23.38 dativered to the vehicle maintenance facility. A Forest Service garage normally purchased OEM part-s from a parts store under a blanket purchase agreement. The supplier generally purchased the parts from OEM dealers and frequently resold them to the Forest Service at list prices. For example, m November 1973, the Forest Servace garage purchased for stock two Chevrolet wheels from the parts store at a total list price of $70.70. Had this purchase been made from the General Motors warehouse, the total price would have been $31.18, a difference of $39.52.

The lowest prices for General. hotors parts were obtamed by using the Federal Supply Schedule contractor as tie source of suPPlY* Also, most agencies were able to obtain Federal Supply Schedule przces for Amencan tifotors parts from either the contractor at Portland, Oregon, or American Motors dealers. The lowest prices for Ford, Chrysler, and International Harvester parts were attained by usmg term contracts as the pnnclpal method of purchase. Both the Postal Service and Federal Supply Sernce used this method of procurement. ABC used purchase orders while the other four agencies used blanket purchase agreements. Although substantial savings could be achieved by ordering General Motors parts from the Federal, Supply Schedule contractor, nest agencies were reluctant to use this source of supply because of the relatively longer delavery times evolved. The prlnclpal contractor supply point is located at Beaverton, Oregon. ALTEWATE PARTS As shown in the table at page 2, price mdexes for alternate parts ranged from a high of 128 for the Forest Servzce to a low of 63 for the Postal Service. Average prices paid by flare agencies vzslted exceeded Postal Servlce prices by from 44 to 103 percent. While zhese fxve agencies use blanket purchase agreements or mtindual purchase orders (AX) as their predomnant method of procurement, the Postal Servzce uses term contracts. OPPOR~ITY FOR SAVINGS We believe the Government could achmve substantial savmgs through the use of competitively awarded term contracts to meet the combined auto parts needs of agencies at field locations. Whzle centralized purchases or procurements m large quantxties should result in the lowest possible prices, field ixastallatlons must consrder both price and dellveml time as maJor factors UI determning the best method of procureneut. Prompt delivery precludes the hxgh cost of muntainmg large inventories. Blanket purchase agreements Tath local concerns are an effective means of securmg parts promptly. However, as demonstrated previously, they are not an effective moans for attaming low prices. Regulations covering the use of blanket purchase agreements do not encourage eompetitlon, apparently in order to avoid the cost of securing quotations for small orders (under $250). For example, the Armed Senrices Procurement Regulations state: -4-

-_II-I -_1*11_-- -------.-I-LII)~ -- --.... -I --- I_--- I ---- -- - -- - --I "3-60411 Purchases Not in Excess of $250. Small purchases not exceeding $250 may be accomplrshed wrthout securrng competltrve quotations If the prices are consldered to be reasonable. Such purchases shall be dlstrlbuted equitably among quaIlfled suppllers. When practical, a quotation ~111 be sollcz&ed from other than the previous supplier prior to placing a repeat order. The admlnlstratlve cost of verlfylng the reasonableness of the price of purchases not m excess of $250 may more than offset potentaal savings m detecting Instances of overprlclng; therefore, action to verify the reasonableness of the price need be taken only when the buyer or contractmg officer suspects that, or has mforma- tlon to andlcate that, the price may not be reasonable, e g., comparison to previous price pazd, personal knowledge of the Itern involved H Thzs regulation seems to Ignore the fact that mdlvldual orders under $250, on a day-to-day basis, when considered over a period of time (a year) ~~11 amount to several thousand dollars and that prices can be established m advance so that the cost of obtalnlng competltron and establlshlng prices need be incurred only once a year rather than every day or every week. Notwlthstandlng the apparent shortcomrngs UI the crted regulation, Federal Procurement Regulations provide a means of satlsfylng both price and prompt dellvery ObJectlves by encouraging cooperative use by one agency of the local term contracts of another agency. The regulations also state "In furtherance of the econormcal and other advantages to be galned from cross utlllzatlon of local term contracts, wherever possible the requirements of several offices UI the same community should be combined and Included In a szngle contract." The Report of The Commlsslon on Government Procurement endorses the use of lndeflnlte dellvery/quantlty type term contracts as an effective means of obtalnlng price advantages through consolidated purchasing without IncurrIng warehouslng costs and sxmpllfylng ordering by elz.mlnatlng lndlvldual purchases. Agencies we vlslted had not establlshed multiple-use local term contracts to meet their combined needs for commercial vehrcle parts. We belleve that neither the blanket purchase agreements nor the nonmandatory GSA Federal Supply Schedule 1s the best method of procurement -5-

for all purchases by field mstallatmns, because they do not provide optmum prices. Further, with respect to the Federal Supply Schedules, dellvery periods are frequently unacceptable to the agencies The table on page2 shows that the Postal Service purchased alternate parts at slgnlflcantly lower prices than the other agencies vlslted, and the table on page 3 shows that the Federal Supply Service purchased OEM parts (Ford, Chrysler, and InternatIonal Harvester) at substantially lower prrces. We belleve that local term contracts consolidating the needs for alternate parts at the local level would result In prices at least as low as those obtamed by the Seattle Dlstrlct Postal Servmze. While OEM price Indexes equivalent to those experienced by the Federal Supply Service most likely could not be achieved for multiple-use term contracts XL local areas (because the volume would be less than under the Federal Supply Servxce term contracts), we belleve there are opportunltles for lower prices. For example, the followrng price Indexes appear at talnable. General Motors--115, Ford--go, Chrysler--95, IHC--95. Smce General Motors parts can be purchased at substantially lower prices under the Federal Supply Schedule, we have encouraged agencies to use it whenever feasible. However, because of dellvery problems, It appears agencies ~~11 continue to purchase a maJor share of General Motors parts needs locally. Accordingly, local term contracts should also result m savmgs for the purchase of General Motors parts. As a result of our survey, agencies are seeklng ways to obtain lower prrces for automotive parts, lncludlng the use of term contracts. Because Region 10 1s asslgned contracting responslbllzty for the natlonal Federal Supply Schedule and has extenszve experience In the procurement of vehicle parts we belleve your offrce IS In a unique posltlon to take a lead role za negotratlng multiple use term contracts with local suppliers Several agency offlclals told us that they would be receptive to the use of such local term contracts RECOMMERDATION To reduce the cost of automotive parts purchased locally by Federal agencies, we recommend that you consider, In consultation with other agencies, the feaslblllty of negotlatlng multiple use term contracts with local suppliers -6-
