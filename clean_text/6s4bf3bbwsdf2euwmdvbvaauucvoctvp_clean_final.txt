Markun has filed an initial decision finding that Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, Incorporated, a broker-dealer registered with the Commission, wilfully aided and abetted a wilful violation of the tender offer re- quirements of Section l4(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 178n(d), in purchasing for a client on the Pacific Stock Exchange, in June 1980, 9% of the outstanding common stock of Diamond International Corporation in a single transaction involving some 256 sellers. The client concededly did not comply with the tender offer requirements of Section l4(d) and Commission rules thereunder. A tender offer under Section l4(d) by another offeror was pending at the time of the June 1980 acquisition of 9.9% of the Diamond common stock by Respondent's client. The decision further found that two associated persons of the Respondent, wholly- owned broker-dealer subsidiaries Blyth Eastman Paine Webber and Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins also wilfully aided and abetted the primary violation, thus establishing an additional basis for imposition of a sanction against the Respon- dent. On the basis of several factors, Judge Markun concluded that the finding by the Commission of wilful aiding and abetting violations would adequately satisfy the public interest without imposition of a sanction upon the Respondent. The decision is subject to review by the commission on its own motion or on petition of a party. 1M. 'BCEEDI1I8S RELTRON CORP. ENJOINED The Commission announced that on January 5 the U.s. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction against Reltron Corp. of Rochester, New York, restraining it from failing to file timely peri06ic ~eports and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings. Reltron, consenting to the entry of the Court's judgment, admitted that it had filed reports in an untimely manner on 13 separate occasions and failed to file six Notifications of Late Filing required to have been filed in connection with its late periodic reports. The Commission's complaint was filed on November 9, 1982. Reltron has agreed to adopt certain procedures to assure timely filing of reports required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. (SEC v. Reltron Corp., U.S.D.C.
