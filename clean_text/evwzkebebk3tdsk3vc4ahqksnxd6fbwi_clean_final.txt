STATE REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICT 23 STEVENS, Anne V. (R) P.O. Box 3470 Honolulu, HI 96801 Contact Number: (808) 222-2964 E-mail: StevensA002@hawaii.rr.com Web Page: www.StevensHD23.com I am truly honored to represent the residents of House District 23 in the State Legislature. This past session produced some good legislatio n in the areas of pu blic safety and tax relief. I focused my efforts in the areas of the Ala Wai Watershed, Harbor Repair, Elder Care, Noise Abatement and Homeless Issues. Significant progress was made in these areas, but I believe there is much more work to be done. That is why I will seek election to continue serving the citizens of Al a Moana, Kaka’ako and Waikiki. If I am elected, I will continue to work on the above areas as well as for tax relief for businesses and residents. The need for infrastructure upgrades in the areas of water, sewage and electrical service has become a critical issue fo r House District 23. Our neighborhoods are at a turning point, with the opportunity for some wonderful new and redevelopments. However, the infrastructu re must be upgraded to support the plans. For the residents who have not yet met me, by way of introduc tion, I am a 13 year resident of Kaka’ako. I served as an officer in the US Coast Guard and have managed small businesses in Hawaii. I am a member of the Board of Ad visors for the Hawaii Ocean Safety Team and in my spare time, I like to play tennis.
