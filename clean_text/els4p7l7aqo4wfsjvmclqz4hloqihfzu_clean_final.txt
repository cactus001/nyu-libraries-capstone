Comptroller of the Currency Administrator of National Banks Washington, D.C. 20219 Corporate Decision #97-72 August 1997 DECISION OF THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY ON THE APPLICATION TO MERGE FIRST AMERICAN BANK, N.A., LISBON, NORTH DAKOTA, WITH AND INTO FIRST AMERICAN BANK, N.A., MOORHEAD, MINNESOTA July 21, 1997 _____________________________________________________________________________ I. INTRODUCTION On May 21 , 1997, an Application was filed with the Office of the Comptroller of th e Currenc y ("OCC") for approval to merge First American Bank, National Association, Lisbon , North Dakota ("Lisbon Bank") with and into First American Bank, National Association , Moorh ead, Minnesota ("Moorhead Bank"), under the charter and title of the latter, under 1 2 U.S.C. §§ 215a-1, 1828(c) & 1831u(a) ("the Merger Applicat ion"). Moorhead Bank has its main office in Moorhead, Minnesota. I t also has a branch in Moorhead, Minnesota. Lisbon Bank has its main office in L isbon, North Dakota, and operates branches in North Dakota. In the Merger Applicatio n, OCC approval is also requested for the resulting bank to retain Moorhead Bank' s main office as the main office of the resu lting bank under 12 U.S.C. § 1831u(d)(1), and to retain Moorhead Bank's branch and Lisbon Bank's main office and branches, as branches after th e merger under 12 U.S.C. §§ 36(d) & 1831u(d)(1). Both L isbon Bank and Moorhead Bank are subsidiaries of Bremer Financial Corporation ("Bremer") , a multistate bank holding company headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota. In th e proposed merger, two of Bremer's existing bank subsidiari es will be combined into one bank with branches. As of March 31, 1997, the Lisbon Bank ha d approximately $91.8 million in assets and $75.8 million in deposits. As of the same date, the Moorhead Bank had approximately $3. 6 million in assets and $343,000 in deposits. II. LEGAL AUTHORITY A. The Interstate Merger is Authorized under 12 U.S.C. §§ 215a-1 & 1831u.

- 2 - For purposes of section 1831u, the following definitions apply: The term "home State" means, with respect1 to a national bank, "the State in which the main office of the bank is located." The term "host State" means, "wit h respect to a bank, a S tate, other than the home State of the bank, in which the bank maintains, or seeks to establish and maintain, a branch." The term "interstate merger transaction" means any mer ger transaction approved pursuant to section 1831u(a)(1). The term "out-of-State bank" means, "with respect to any St ate, a bank whose home State is another State." The te rm "responsible agency" means the agency determined in accordance with 12 U.S.C. § 1828(c)(2) (namely, the OCC if the acquiring, assuming, or resulting bank is a national bank). See 12 U.S.C. § 1831u(f)(4), (5), (6), (8) & (10).In 1994, Congress enacted legislation to create a framework for interstate mergers an d branching by ba nks. See Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-328, 108 Stat. 2338 (enacted September 29, 1994) ("t he Riegle-Neal Act"). The Riegle-Neal Act added a new section 44 to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act that authorize s certain interstate merger transactions beginning on June 1, 1997. See Riegle-Neal Act § 102(a) (adding new section 44, 12 U.S.C. § 1831u). It also made conforming amendments to th e provisions on mergers and co nsolidations of national banks to permit national banks to engage in such section 44 interstate merger transactions. See Riegle-Neal Act § 102(b)(4) (adding a new section, codified at 12 U.S.C. § 215a-1). It also added a similar conforming amendment to the McFadden Act to permit national banks to maintain and operate branches in accordance wit h section 44. See Riegle-Neal Act § 102(b)(1)(B) (adding new subsection 12 U.S.C. § 36(d)). Section 44 authorizes mergers between banks with different home states: (1) In Ge neral. -- Beginning on June 1, 1997, the responsible agency ma y approve a merger t ransaction under section 18(c) [12 U.S.C. § 1828(c), the Bank Merger Act] bet ween insured banks with different home States, without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under the law of any State. 12 U.S.C. § 1831u(a)(1). The Act permits a state to elect to prohibit such interstate merge r1 transactions involving a bank whose home s tate is the prohibiting state by enacting a law between September 29, 1994, and May 31, 1997, that expressly prohibits all mergers with all out-of-state banks. See 12 U.S.C. § 1831u(a)(2) (state "opt-out" laws). In this Me rger Application, the home states of the banks are Minnesota and North Dakota; neither state has opted out. Accordingly, this Merger Application may be approved under 12 U.S.C. §§ 215a-1 & 1831u(a). In addition, an application to engage in an interstate merger transaction under 12 U.S.C. § 1831u is also subject to certain requirements and conditions set forth in sections 1831u(a)(5) and 1831u(b) of the Riegle-Neal Act. These conditions are: (1) compliance with state-imposed age limits, if any, subject to the Act’s limits; (2) compliance with certain state filing requirements , to the extent the filing requirements are perm itted in the Act; (3) compliance with nationwide and state concentration limits; (4) community reinvestment compliance; and (5) adequacy of capital and management skills. The Merger Application satisfies all these conditions to the extent applicable. First, the proposal satisfies the state-imposed age requirements permitted by section 1831u(a)(5). Unde r that section, the OCC may not approve a merger under section 1831u(a)(1) "that would have the

- 3 - Under this provision, states are permitted to impose a filing r equirement on out-of-state banks that will operate2 branches in the state as a result of an interstate merger transaction under the Riegle-Neal Act, but the states may impose only th ose requirements that are within the terms specified. Since Congress has specifically set forth and limited what state filing requirements apply for these interstate transactions, it clearly intended that only those requirements woul d apply, and the states may not impose others. Thus, in a transaction involving only national banks, only the filin g requirements allowed under section 1831u(b)(1) must be complied with. However, where a state bank is involved, a state may continue to have authority to impose greater requirements on its own state-chartered banks, because of th e reservation of authority in section 1831u(c)(3). Moreover, as a general matter, national banks are formed an d incorporated under, and governed by, federal law. Thei r authority to enter mergers, to establish branches, or to undergo other changes in their corporate existence is determined by federal law, not state law; and any requisite approval is by the OCC, not state author ities. For a fuller discussion of this subject, see, e.g. , Decision on the Applications to Merge First Interstate Ba nks into Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (OCC Corporate Decision No. 96-29, June 1, 1996) (at pages 4-5, 12-14 & note 11).effect of permitting an out-of -State bank or out-of-State bank holding company to acquire a bank in a host state that has not been in existence for the minimum period of time, if any, specified in the statutory law of the host State." 12 U.S.C. § 1831u(a)(5)(A). In this Merger Application, Moorhead Bank is acquiring by merger a bank (Lisbon Bank) in the host state of North Dakota. The statutory laws of North Dakota do not contain any minimum age requirement. Thus, th e Lisbon Bank/Moorhead Bank merger satisfies the Riegle-Neal Act requi rement of compliance with state age laws. Second, the proposal meets the applicable filing requirements. A bank applying for a n interstate merger transaction under section 1831u(a) must (1) "com ply with the filing requirements of any host State of the bank which will result from such transaction" as long as the filin g requireme nt does not discriminate against out-of-state banks and is similar in effect to filin g requirements imposed by the host stat e on out-of-state nonbanking corporations doing business in the host state, and (2) submit a copy of the application to the state bank supervisor of the hos t state. See 12 U.S .C. § 1831u(b)(1). The North Dakota interstate banking statute provides that2 an "out- of-state bank that will be the resulting bank pursuant to an interstate merger involving a North Dakota bank must notify and submit a copy o f its interstate merger application to the board of the proposed merger not later than the date on which it files th e application with the responsible federal regulatory authority." N.D. Cent. Code § 6-08.4-05 (1996). As implemented to date, the filing requirements of section 6-08.4-05 do not appear to discriminate against out-of-stat e banks or to impose a filing requirement more burdensome than that imposed on nonbankin g corporati ons. Moorhead Bank provided a copy of its OCC Merger Application to the Nort h Dakota state bank supervisor. Thus, the Lisbon Bank/Moorhead Ba nk merger satisfies the Riegle- Neal Act requirement of compliance with state filing requirements. Third, the propos ed interstate merger transaction does not raise issues with respect to the deposit concentration limits of the Riegle-Neal Act. Section 1831u(b) (2) places certain nationwide and statewide deposit concentration limits on section 1831u(a) interstate merger transactions . However, interst ate merger transactions involving only affiliated banks are specifically excepted from the se provisions. See 12 U.S.C. § 1831u(b)(2)(E). Lisbon Bank and Moorhead Bank are affiliates; thus section 1831u(b)(2) is not applicable to this merger.

--- Page 3 ---
- 4 - Fourth, the proposed interstate merger transaction also does not raise issues with respect to the spe cial community reinvestment compliance provisions of the Riegle-Neal Act. I n determining whet her to approve an application for an interstate merger transaction under section 1831u(a), the OCC must (1) comply with its responsibilities under section 804 of the federa l Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"), 12 U.S.C. § 2903, (2) take into account the CR A evaluation s of any bank which would be an affiliate of the resulting bank, and (3) take int o account the applicant banks' record of compliance with applicable state community reinvestment laws. See 12 U.S.C. § 1831u(b)(3). However, this provision does not apply to mergers between affiliated banks since it applies only "for an interstate merger transaction in which the resulting bank would have a bra nch or bank affiliate immediately following the transaction in any State in which the bank submitting the application (as the acquiring bank) had no branch or bank affiliate immediat ely before the transaction." 12 U.S.C. § 1831u(b)(3). See also H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 651, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 52 (1994). In this Merger Application, Moorhead Bank (the ban k submitting t he application as the acquiring bank) has a bank affiliate in North Dakota before the transaction ( i.e., Lisbon Bank), and is also not otherwise obtaining a branch or bank affiliate in any state in which it did not have a branch or bank affiliate before. Thus, this Riegle-Neal Act provision is not applicable to the Merger Application. However, the Community Reinvestment Act itself is applicable, as discussed below, see Part III-B. Fifth, the proposal satisfies the adequacy of capital and management skills requirements in the Riegle-Neal Act. The OCC may approve an application for an interstate merger transaction under section 1831u(a) only if each bank involved in the transaction is adequately capitalized as of the date the application is filed and the resulting ban k will continue to be adequately capitalized and adequately managed upon consummation of the transaction. See 12 U.S.C. § 1831u(b)(4). As of the d ate the application was filed, both Lisbon Bank and Moorhead Bank satisfied al l regulatory and supervisory requirements relating to adequate capitalization. Currently, each bank is at least satisfactorily managed. The OCC has also determined that, following the merger , Moorhead Bank will continue to exceed the standards for an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank. The requirements of 12 U.S.C. § 1831u(b)(4) are therefore satisfied. Accordi ngly, the proposed interstate merger transaction between Lisbon Bank an d Moorhead Bank is legally permissible under section 1831u. B. Following the Merger, the Resulting Bank Ma y Retain Moorhead Bank's and Lisbon Bank's Existing Main Offices and Branches under 1 2 U.S.C. §§ 36(d) & 1831u(d)(1). The Applican ts have requested that, upon the completion of the merger, Moorhead Bank (as the res ulting bank in the merger) be permitted to retain and continue to operate its existin g main off ice in Moorhead, Minnesota, as the main office of the resulting bank, and to retain and operate as branches (1) its own branch and (2) the main office and branches of Lisbon Bank i n

--- Page 4 ---
- 5 - Lisbon Bank has received approval to open a branch in Fargo, North Dakota, which will not open prior to3 the merger. North Dakota law permits state-wide branching. N.D. Cent. Code § 6-03-13.1 (1996). We note that after the merger, Moorhead Bank, by virtue of its branches in North Dakota, would be authorized to establish and operate this branch under 12 U.S.C. § 36(c). As a result, the unopened branch will continue to be approved by the OCC after the merger. By its action in adding section 3 6(d), Congress made it clear that section 44(d)(1) is an express and complete4 grant of offic e-retention authority for interstate merger transactions effected under section 44 and that it operate s independently of th e provisions for branch retention in mergers under 12 U.S.C. § 36(b)(2). Neither section 36(d) nor section 18 31u(d)(1) refers to section 36(b)(2). Congress clearly was aware of the McFadden Act's existing provisions for branch r etention in mergers at the time it acted on section 44 and the way in which those provisions applied fo r interstate national banks, since the OCC had approved interstate main office relocation transactions that also involved mergers with affiliate banks in which the resulting bank's authority to retain branches was based on section 36(b)(2) . The Conference Report to the Riegle-Neal Act makes reference to such OCC decisions. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 651, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 57 (1994). By expressly providing for office-retention in section 1831u(d)(1) and the n incorporating that into the McFadden Act in section 36(d), Congress cle arly intended that those provisions apply to branch retention in interstate merger transactions under section 1831u, rather than the complex branch retention provisions of section 36(b)(2). Of course, s ection 36(b)(2) continues to govern branch retention in national bank mergers that are not entered into under section 18 31u, including mergers involving an interstate bank (such as a merger of an interstate bank into another national bank in its home state).North Dakota . In an interstate merger transaction under section 1831u, the resulting bank' s3 retention and continued operation of the offices of the merging banks is expressly provided for: (1) Continued Operations. -- A resulting bank may, subject to the approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency, retain and operate, as a main office or a branch, any office that any bank involved in an interstate merger transaction was operating as a main off ice or a branch immediately before the merger transaction. 12 U.S.C. § 183 1u(d)(1). The resulting bank is the "bank that has resulted from an interstat e merger transaction under this section [section 1831u(a)]." 12 U.S.C. § 1831u(f)(11). In addition, Congr ess also added a conforming amendment to the McFadden Act to emphasize that branc h retention in an interstate merger transaction under section 1831u occurs under the authority o f section 1831u(d): (d) Branches Resulting From Interstate Merger Transactions. -- A national bank resulting from an interstate merger transaction (as defined in section 44(f)(6) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) may mainta in and operate a branch in a State other than the home State (as defined in subsection (g)(3)( B)) of such bank in accordance with section 44 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. § 1831u]. 12 U.S.C. § 36(d) (as added by Riegle-Neal Act § 102(b)(1)(B)). Therefore, Moorhead Bank, the resul ting bank in this interstate merger transaction, may retain and continue to operate all of the existing bankin g offices of both Moorhead Bank and Lisbon Bank under 12 U.S.C. §§ 36(d) & 1831u(d)(1). 4

--- Page 5 ---
- 6 - Moreover, at its branches in N orth Dakota and Minnesota, Moorhead Bank is authorized to engage in all activities permissible for national banks. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. §§ 215a-1 (Riegle- Neal merg ers with a resulting national bank occur under the National Bank Consolidation an d Merger Act), 215a(e) (the resulting national bank in a merger succeeds to all the rights, franchises and interes ts of the merging banks), & 1831u(d)(1) (continued operations at retained interstat e branches). See also 12 U.S.C. § 36(f) (general provisions for host state laws applicable t o branches in the host state of out-of-state national banks). III. ADDITIONAL STATUTORY AND POLICY REVIEWS A. The Bank Merger Act. The Bank Merger Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1828(c), r equires the OCC's approval for any merger between insured banks where the resulting i nstitution will be a national bank. Under the Act, the OCC generally may not approve a merger which would substantially lessen competition. I n addition, the Act also requires the OCC to take into consideration the financial and manageria l resources and future prospe cts of the existing and proposed institutions, and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. For the reasons stated below, we find the Merge r Application may be approved under section 1828(c). Competitive Analysis Since Moorhead Bank and Lisbon Bank are already owned by the same bank holdin g company, their merger will have no anticompetitive effects. Financial and managerial resources The financial and managerial resources of both banks are presently satisfactory. Moorhead Bank expect s to achieve efficiencies by operating the offices in North Dakota as branches rather than as a separate corporate entity. The geographic diversification of its operations will als o strengthen the combined bank . The future prospects of the existing institutions, individually and combined, are favorable. Thus, we find the financial and managerial r esources factor is consistent with approval of the Merger Application. Convenience and needs The resulting bank will help to meet the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Moorhead Bank will c ontinue to serve the same areas in Minnesota where it has offices, and it will add Lisbon Bank’s offices in North Dakota. Both banks currently offer a full line of banking services, and there will be no reductions in the products or services as a result of th e merger. The combined bank will continue to offer a full line of banking products and services. The bran ches in North Dakota will continue to engage in the same business, serving the sam e communities, that Lisbon Bank is currently engaged in.

--- Page 6 ---
- 7 - Upon completion of the merger, customers of each bank will have available to them a greater number of branches at which to ba nk. Currently, banking is not as convenient as it could be for customers w ho frequently travel across the state lines or for business customers who have operations in more than one state. Following the merger, customers would be dealing with the same bank in the two states and will be able to readily access their accounts with greate r conven ience. The merger will permit the resulting bank to better serve its customers and at a lower cost. The combined resources, including capital and reserves, of the currently separat e banks will provide a more substantial capital cushion for unexpected losses as well as provid e business customers with a higher legal lending limit. No branch c losings are contemplated as a result of this merger since the two banks serve different areas. However, as part of its ongoing business plans, Moorhead Bank will evaluate its branches and, as a part of the normal course of business, may close redundant or unprofitabl e branches. Any such closures will be made in acc ordance with applicable statutes and regulations, including notification of customers of the branc hes, and will consider the needs of the community affected. Accordingly, we bel ieve the impact of the merger on the convenience and needs of the communities to be served is consistent with approval of the Merger Application. B. The Community Reinvestment Act The Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") requires the OCC to take into account th e applicants' record of helping to meet the credit needs of their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, when evaluating certain applications. See 12 U.S.C . § 2903. Lisb on Bank does not have a current CRA rating from the OCC because it recentl y converted to a national bank. Its predecessor, a state bank, had a satisfactory rating with respect to CRA perform ance. Moorhead Bank does not have a current CRA rating because it is a relatively new charter. No public comments were received by the OCC relating to thi s Applica tion, and the OCC has no other basis to question the banks' performance in complyin g with the CRA. The merger is not expected to have any adverse effect on the resulting bank's CR A performance. The resulting bank will continue to serve the same communities that the merging banks currently serve. Moorhead Bank will continue its current CRA programs and policies in Minneso ta. After Lisbon Bank is merged into Moorhead Bank, its North Dakota offices wil l remain open as branc hes of Moorhead Bank. Moorhead Bank will carry forward the same CRA programs and polici es that the bank has today and add other programs it develops. As a general matter, the resulting ban k will have the same commitment to helping meet the credit needs of all the communities it serves as Moorhead Bank and L isbon Bank have today as separate banks. The merger and operation of interstate branches do not alter the resulting bank's obligation to hel p meet the credit n eeds of its communities in both states it serves. We find that approval of th e proposed merger is consistent with the Community Reinvestment Act. IV. CONCLUSION AND APPROVAL

--- Page 7 ---
- 8 - For the r easons set forth above, including the representations and commitments made by the applicants, we fi nd that the merger of Moorhead Bank and Lisbon Bank is legally authorized as an interstate merger tran saction under the Riegle-Neal Act, 12 U.S.C. §§ 215a-1 & 1831u(a), the resulting bank is authorized to retain and operate the offices of both banks under 12 U.S.C. §§ 36(d) & 1831u(d)(1), and that the merger meets the other statutory criteria for approval . Accordingly, this Merger Application is hereby approved. /s/ 07-21-97 Steven J. Weiss Date Deputy Comptroller Bank Organization and Structure Application Control Number: 97-MW-02-0040
