These expenditures include amounts for inst ruction of pupils with disabilities in a general education setting. The pupil count for General Education is K-12 average daily membersh ip plus K-12 pupils for whom the district pays tuition to a nother school district. This number represents all pupils, including both those classified as having disabilities and those not so cl assified. For districts in which a county jail is located, this number includes incarcerated youth to whom the district must provide an educa tion program. Instructional Expenditures for Special Education are K-12 expendi tures for students with disabilities (including summer special education expenditures) plus a proration of building-level adm inistrative and instructional support expenditures. The pupil count for Special Education is a count of K-12 students with disabilities as of December 1, 2005 plus students for wh om the district receives tuiti on from another district. Expenditures Per Pupil is the simple arithmetic ratio of Instru ctional Expenditures to Pupils. The total cost of instruction fo r pupils with disabilities may include both general and special education expenditu res. Special education services provided in the general ed ucation classroom may benefit students not cl assified as havi ng disabilities. District expenditures such as transportati on, debt service, and district-wide adminis tration are not included in these values. The numbers used to compute the statistics on this page were collected on the St ate Aid Form A, the State Aid Form F, and the School Distri ct Annual Financial Report (ST-3). Similar District Groups are identified according to the Need-to -Resource-Capacity Index defined and used in the Annual Report t o the Governor and Legislature on the Educati onal Status of the State's Schools.
