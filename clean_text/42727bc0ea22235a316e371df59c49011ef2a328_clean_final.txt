Welcome to the INFORM 2024 report. 2024 marks the 10th year of release of the INFORM Risk Index. In 2014, INFORM Partners first came together to create an open index for measuring the risk of humanitarian crises globally. Since then, the INFORM Risk Index and other INFORM products have become established and relied upon in the decision-making systems of organisations across the multilateral system. INFORM partners believe that the availability of shared analysis of crises and disasters can lead to better coordination of actors and better outcomes for at-risk and affected people. Specifically, INFORM creates a space and process for shared analysis that can support joint strategy development, planning and action to prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from crises. This can bring together development, humanitarian and other actors to manage risk and respond better when crises do occur. This report looks back on how INFORM has developed over that last decade and analyses some trends in crises and crisis risk over that time. It sets out INFORM’s vision for a suite of products to support decision-making that are easy to use and open to everyone. This vision involves bringing scientific rigour to the process of analysing crises and pooling expertise to develop shared methodologies. By working together, we can reduce the investments required by individual organisations, assure the quality of our analysis and make it available for the common good.Shared analysis for better decisions 10 years of INFORM 1 2

In a world increasingly marred by complex crises, the mix of conflict, climate issues and economic instability has exacerbated the reliance on humanitarian aid. Millions of people are displaced for long periods and food insecurity is rising. Humanitarian responses, despite heroic efforts to scale up, are struggling to meet people's needs, leaving more and more individuals without essential services during crises. The European Union, grounded in the principle of solidarity, stands as the leading provider of humanitarian and development aid in the world by far. In the face of escalating crises, the EU’s commitment to providing humanitarian assistance remains firm. At the same time fostering development investment to address root causes of humanitarian crises is crucial for steering affected populations towards recovery and sustainable growth. And to do this correctly, we need scientific evidence. This is why, the INFORM Partners, including the European Commission and humanitarian and development organisations worldwide, joined forces ten years ago and created an open index for measuring the risk of humanitarian crises. Since then, the INFORM Risk Index and other INFORM products have become a key component of the decision-making systems of many organisations at global as well as local levels. The uniqueness of INFORM lies in its ability to enrich existing knowledge and improve common understanding of disaster risks, the severity of the humanitarian crises and the impacts of climate change. Through collective effort, it delivers scientifically sound, independent and objective analyses, ensuring transparency and accountability in the political context of humanitarian aid. This facilitates evidence-based allocation of humanitarian aid and at the same time enables integrated strategies for disaster risk and crisis management. The Commission, through its Joint Research Centre and the Department of Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, exemplifies the effectiveness of integrating evidence-based knowledge into humanitarian actions. This alignment underscores the key role of science in bridging the humanitarian gap and transforming crisis management trends. As we mark the 10th year anniversary of the INFORM Risk Index, the first analytical tool within the INFORM suite, we are reminded of the critical role of evidence-based collective action and the power of solidarity in addressing the challenges we face. Looking ahead, let us leverage the scientific insights provided by INFORM to guide our humanitarian and development efforts, striving for a more resilient and sustainable future for all. Together, we can make a difference and ensure that no one is left behind in times of crisis.Foreword Iliana Ivanova European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and YouthJanez Lenar i European Commissioner for Crisis Management 3 4

It seeks to communicate the current status of crises in a systematic, objective and understandable way. In its use - in combination with other sources of information - the INFORM Severity Index is intended to : Monitor trends in crisis severity over time.Contribute to decisions on the allocation of resources in a way that is proportionate with crisis severityLead to a shared and objective understanding of crisis severity Justify and advocate for action, especially in the case of forgotten or unrecognised crises. The INFORM Se verity Index can be used to support decisions that r equire an unders tanding of the se verity of crises globally or to unders tand changes in cr isis se verity over time.ANAL YTIC AL FR AMEW ORK AND METHODOL OGY The INFORM Severity Index is a composite indicator that measur es the severity of humanitarian crises against a common scale. The analytical framework describes how the Index is constructed. Indicators ar e collected to populate the analytical framework for every crisis and these indicators ar e used to calculate the Index . The Index covers: • The impact of the crisis itself, in te rms of the scope and of its geographical, human and physical ef fects; • The conditions and status of the people affected, including infor mation about the distribution of severity (i.e. the number of people in each categor y of severity within a crisis); • The complexity of the crisis, in ter ms of factors that af fect its mitigation or resolution .

INFORM RISK 2024 Natural Hazard updates For the 2024 INFORM Risk Index, we introduce an updated methodology for calculating the Natural Hazard category of the Hazards and Exposure dimension. The objectives of the update are to: 1) Introduce newly available, state-of-the-art models of sudden-onset hazards and multi-temporal population distribution to improve the quality of the risk analysis of humanitarian crises and allow for better trend analysis; 2) Integrate new hazards and data that provide better information on hazards that are exacerbated by climate change and align the INFORM Risk and INFORM Climate Change Risk Indexes. The update covers three main areas: New data sources Conceptual framework and indicatorsPopulation dynamics Dividing the flood hazard component into separate coastal flood and river flood and aligning the INFORM Risk Index and INFORM Climate Change Risk Index.Introducing the new Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) to improve the calculation of exposure to natural hazards and trends over time. The GHSL is a global multi-temporal (1975-2030, 5-year interval) layer depicting the distribution of population.Introducing new data sources for specific hazards (except Tsunami) to take account of recent improvements.

20How it works INFORM Climate Change incorporates climate and socioeconomic projections into the methodology of the INFORM Risk Index. Specifically, it uses a combination of: • Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) describing the evolution of future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and other radiative forcings • Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) that portray how socioeconomic factors may change over the next century Together, these scenarios are used to project the Hazard and Exposure dimension of the INFORM Risk Index into the future, taking into account changes to climate-related hazards (river flood, drought, coastal flood and epidemics) and the distribution of exposed populations. The epidemics component comprises malaria and dengue. The population projections derived from SSPs are also applied to non-climate natural hazards (earthquake, tsunami) and non-modelled hazards (tropical cyclone wind). Tropical cyclone wind has not been included because changes cannot be modelled with sufficient geographic accuracy. Population and other socioeconomic projections are used to project conflict hazard. In future iterations of the tool, changes to vulnerability may also be included. The projections are applied at different timeframes (2022, 2050, 2080) to calculate the Change in risk and the Vulnerability gap – the level of vulnerability reduction or coping capacity increase required for a country to preserve its current level of risk. 21 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)INFORM Risk Index Hazard and Exposure dimension River Flood Coastal Flood Drought Epidemics (malaria and dengue) Non-climate and non-modelled hazardsClimate hazards Conflict Tsunami Cyclone EarthquakeConcentration Pathway Sustainability (SSP1) Middle of the road (SSP2) Regional rivalry (SSP3) Fossil Fuel Development (SSP5) Socioeconomic Pathway2022 2050 2080 Moderate (RCP4.5) High (RCP8.5) Climate & Socioeconomic Projections Hazard Projections Demographic Projections Other Socioeconomic ProjectionsChange in risk Vulnerability gapResults SHARING CRISIS ANALYSISINFORM Climate Change is a new INFORM product based on the INFORM Risk Index. It incorporates climate and socioeconomic projections to analyse how risk will change as a result of climate change under different emission and population scenarios. INFORM Climate Change is a result of collaboration between the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change and Joint Research Centre of European Commission.INFORM CLIMATE CHANGE Objectives The objective of INFORM Climate Change is to inform decision-making around the risk of climate-amplified hazards, as well as how increased risks could be offset by improved vulnerability and coping capacity. Specifically, it is intended to: • Lead to a shared and objective understanding of the impact of climate change on the risk of humanitarian crises • Support policy-making that leads to greater resilience to the adverse impacts of climate change • Support decisions on the allocation of DRR and climate adaptation resources that is consistent with SDG and Sendai targets • Identify inequalities in climate impacts, for example on marginalised groups like people on the move 23 24

INFORM Climate Change is based on the INFORM Risk Index methodology, so it measures changes in the risk of a humanitarian crisis that could overwhelm national capacity. The results of INFORM Climate Change include the following: • INFORM Climate Change Risk Index baseline – a slightly adapted INFORM Risk Index that allows comparison with future hazard projections. • INFORM Climate Change Risk Index – this shows the future risk, taking into account climate and socio-economic changes for different scenarios and timeframes. • Change in risk – this shows the change in the baseline risk index taking into account climate, demographic and socio-economic projections. • Vulnerability Gap – this shows the change in Vulnerability and Lack of Coping Capacity (see INFORM Risk Index analytical framework), which would be required to maintain the baseline level of risk (i.e. to compensate for increases in risk due to climate, demographic and socio-economic factors). These maps and the following tables summarise the change in risk and vulnerability gap for mid-century (≈2050) under both pessimistic and optimistic climate and socio-economic scenarios.

Over the last ten years (INFORM Risk Index 2015-2024), there has been a general increase in the risk of humanitarian crises at global level. While there has been an improvement in coping capacity, this has been negated by large increases in the number of people exposed to hazards, and to their vulnerability. The development of institutions and infrastructure has helped decrease risks, but this has not kept pace with the increased exposure to natural hazards and conflict, combined with socioeconomic challenges. During the last decade, conflict, displacement and shocks like the Covid-19 crisis were important drivers of increasing crisis risk. There is a noticeable increase in vulnerability and risk after 2020 that coincides with the timing of the Covid-19 pandemic and its effects. According to Global Humanitarian Overview 2023, the effects of the pandemic have triggered food and energy price increases in crisis-affected countries. The effect of such price increases on vulnerable people could be one mechanism through which the structural impacts of the pandemic continue to increase broader crisis risks.

The largest increase has been in the Americas and can be attributed to considerable increases in Human Hazard and Uprooted People. There have been considerable improvements in Coping Capacity in the region, mainly related to Infrastructure. However, these could not keep pace with other dimensions. The decrease in risk in Asia is due to a considerable decrease in Socioeconomic Vulnerability and improved Coping Capacity, especially the Infrastructure component. This has counteracted an increase in emerging hazards.

This is due to large underperformance in Hazard and Exposure and Vulnerability dimensions. There has been a large increase in Human Hazards and particular vulnerabilities relating to both Socioeconomic conditions and Vulnerable Groups. Europe has experienced a sharp increase in risk since 2022 (dramatic increase in displacement figures). Oceania has experienced increases in natural and human hazard, and vulnerable groups (uprooted people and health conditions). 33 34

GLOBAL RISK TRENDS Crisis drivers The majority of crises (>70%) tracked by the INFORM Severity Index since its launch in 2020 are driven by human factors (displacement, conflict, violence, political instability). The main changes in the country-level risk of humanitarian crisis over the last 10 years (INFORM Risk Index 2015-2024) are largely correlated with changes in the Human Hazard (conflict, violence, political instability). Countries not affected by human hazards experienced minimal changes. Human Hazards are the major drivers of large increases in risk (Group 1, below) and highly elevated risk (Group 2), over the last 10 years. The average risk is almost two times higher in countries facing conflicts, violence and political instability. Comparison of country risk levels in 2015 and 2024, according to the INFORM Risk Index. Highlighted countries are those where a conflict or related human-hazard event has been recorded in the INFORM Severity Index since 2020. Group 1 – countries experiencing large increases in risk between 2015 and 2024. Group 2 – countries with very high levels of risk. Countries experiencing conflict are over-represented in both groups. Human Hazards have increased in both conflict and non-conflict affected countries over the last 10 years. Furthermore, the direct and indirect impacts of conflict, violence and political instability propagate through all dimensions of risk. Countries affected by conflict have much higher levels of Socio-economic Vulnerability and much higher vulnerability relating to Vulnerable Groups. They also have a large underperformance in Institutional and Infrastructural Coping Capacity. Countries in conflict also have a larger than average exposure to Natural Hazards, possible evidence of cross-correlation between natural hazards, exposure to them and conflict. Trends in average score for different categories of the INFORM Risk Index (2015-2019-2024), separated into groups of countries affected by conflict (tagged conflict, violence or political instability driver in INFORM Severity Index) and not affected by conflict. The direct and indirect impacts of conflict propagate through all dimensions of risk. Drivers of crises in the INFORM Severity Index, since its launch in 2020. 35 36

GLOBAL RISK TRENDS Exposure to natural hazards Average annual exposed population to climate-related sudden-onset natural hazards (river flood, coastal flood, cyclone SS1) (% change from 2015 to 2024)The incorporation of new natural hazard and multi-temporal exposure data into the INFORM Risk Index (see p14/15) allows us to analyse trends and patterns of exposure to sudden-onset natural hazards over the last 10 years. Average annual exposure to sudden-onset natural hazards (river flood, coastal flood, cyclone, earthquake and tsunami) reached 184 million people in 2023 – an 8.6% increase since 2014. Climate-related hazards (river flood, coastal flood and cyclone) are responsible for 95% of the absolute increases in exposure over the last 10 years. River and coastal floods combined account for an increase of 9.2 million in the number of people exposed annually, 62% of the total increase. Eastern, Southern and South-eastern Asia has experienced the largest average annual exposure to sudden-onset hazards (78 million people per year). Middle and Western Africa experienced the largest increase in average annual exposure in the last decade.
