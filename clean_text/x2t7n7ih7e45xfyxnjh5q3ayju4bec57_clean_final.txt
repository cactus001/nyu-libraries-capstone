Study “Decline of ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofu r-related metabolites in bovine tissues after intramuscular administration of ceftiofur sodium (NAXCEL Sterile Powder) to cattle at a rate of 2.2 mg ceftiofur equivalents/kg body weight for five consecutive days”. Study Number: 2000-0427. June 2001. Principal Investigators: D.A. Merritt and M.J. Prough, Pfizer Animal Health, Kalamazoo, MI Animal Species: Bovine Breed: Mixed breed Number of Animals/Sex: 38; 18 male and 18 female (plus 1 male and 1 female control animals) Weights of Animals: 200 to 297 kg Health Status: Clinically healthy Route of Administration: Intramuscular (IM) injection Dose Rate: 2.2 mg ceftiofur equivalents (CE)/kg body weight (actual dose 2.25 ± 0.03 mg CE/kg BW) Duration of Dosing: one injection daily for five consecutive days Marker Residue Depletion Data: Samples of kidney, liver, injection site, muscle, and fat were assayed for desfuroylceftiofur-related residue by the HPLC-DCA assay. The results of the assays are provided in Table 1. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was 0.05 ppm and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.10 ppm. Table 1. Mean Concentration of Ceftiof ur and Desfuroylceftiofur-Related Residues (as DCA) in Bovine Tissues from Animals Receiving Five Doses of NAXCEL Sterile Powder (2.2 mg CE/kg BW) Mean ± S.D., ppm Tissue 3 hours 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours 96 hours 121 hours Kidney 5.29 ± 0.79 1.00 ± 0.18 0.35 ± 0.08 0.20 ± 0.07 0.12 ± 0.02 < LOQ Injection site 33 ± 18 0.94 ± 0.85 0.25 ± 0.07 0.15 ± 0.06 0.21 ± 0.13 < LOQ Liver 1.60 ± 0.25 0.19 ± 0.06 0.44 ± 0.13 < LOQ < LOQ < LOQ Muscle 0.36 ± 0.04 < LOQ < LOD < LOD <LOD NA Fat 0.31 ± 0.15 < LOQ < LOD NA NA NA NA = not assayed By 3 hours after the last dose, all injection sites contained less than 95 ppm DCA. Target Tissue and Marker Residue

--- Page 4 ---
The target tissue for residue monitoring is kidney. The marker residue in edible tissues, including milk, is the sum of ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur-related metabolites, measured by HPLC as the stable derivative desfuroylceftiofur acetamide (DCA). Tolerances Cattle tolerances are: 0.4 ppm DCA in kidney, 2 ppm DCA in liver, 1 ppm DCA in muscle, and 0.1 ppm DCA in milk. For research purposes, a value of 95 ppm DCA has been established for making decisions regarding the safety of the injection site. Withdrawal Period The kidney data were analyzed with a statistical method which determines the statistical tolerance limit for the 99 th percentile of the population with 95% confidence as outlined in FDA’s Guideline for Establishing a Withdrawal Period . The tolerance limit falls below the kidney tolerance of 0.4 ppm at 93 hours after the last dose. The data support the assignment of a 96-hour (4-day) pre-slaughter withdrawal period for the IM treatment. Based on a comparison of residue data for the SC route of administration (FOI Summary for NADA 140-338 dated May 29, 2001) vs. that for the IM route, FDA also established a 4-day pre-slaughter withdrawal period for the SC treatment. Milk Discard The milk tolerance has not changed. Consequently, no milk out data were required and the no discard can be maintained. C. Microbial Food Safety FDA concluded the impact of the proposed supplemental application on microbial food safety was not of a magnitude that required a hazard characterization or a full microbial food safety assessment. D. Analytical Methods for Residues The regulatory method for determination of DCA in swine kidney and muscle, and bovine kidney, muscle, and milk is the HPLC-DCA assay which successfully completed a sponsor-monitored multi-laboratory method trial. The method is on file with the Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855. USER SAFETY: Studies to evaluate the safety of ceftiofur to users are discussed in detail in the original FOI Summary for NAXCEL Sterile Powder (NADA 140-338) dated January 25, 1988.

Human Warnings are provided on the product labeling as follows: Not for human use. Keep out of reach of children. Penicillins and cephalosporins can cause allergic reactions in sensitized individuals. Topical exposures to such antimicrobials, including ceftiofur, may elicit mild to severe allergic reactions in some individuals. Repeated or prolonged exposure may lead to sensitization. Avoid direct contact of the product with the skin, eyes, mouth and clothing. Persons with a known hypersensitivity to penicillin or cephalosporins should avoid exposure to this product. In case of accidental eye exposure, flush with water for 15 minutes. In case of accidental skin exposure, wash with soap and water. Remove contaminated clothing. If allergic reaction occurs (e.g., skin rash, hives, difficult breathing), seek medical attention. The material safety data sheet contains more detailed occupational safety information. To obtain a material safety data sheet (MSDS) please call 1-800-733-5500. To report any adverse event please call 1-800-366-5288. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS: The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR Part 514 of the implementing regulations. The data demonstrate that NAXCEL Sterile Powder, when administered according to the label directions, is safe and effective for the treatment of bovine respiratory disease (shipping fever, pneumonia) associated with Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni ; and for the treatment of acute bovine interdigital necrobacillosis (foot rot, pododermatitis) associated with Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides melaninogenicus . Labeling restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. This decision was based on the following factors: (a ) adequate directions cannot be written to enable lay persons to appropriately diagnose and subsequently use this product to treat bovine respiratory disease or foot rot, and (b) restricting this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian should help prevent indiscriminate use which could result in violative tissue residues. In accordance with 21 CFR 514.106(b)(2) this is a Category II change which did not require a reevaluation of safety and effectiveness data in the parent application. This approval does not qualify for marketing exclusivity under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. No patent information was submitted with this application.
