January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 SOP No. 14 Recommended Standard Operating Procedure for Gravimetric Calibration of Volumetric Standards Using an Electronic Balance 1 Introduction 1 Purpose of Test This procedure is a precision mass ca libration converting mass values to volumetric values using pure water as a st andard reference material. The results provide calibration of either the "to deliv er" or "to contain" volume of measuring containers that may be used as volumetric measuring standards. The procedure uses gravimetric calibration principles to minimize calibration uncertainties. Accordingly, the procedure is especially useful for high accuracy calibrations. The procedure references measurement cont rol standards to ensure the validity of the standards and the measurement process; however, additional good measurement practices such as those re quired for precision mass calibrations must be used. The procedure makes use of an electronic balance and is suitable for all sizes of gravimetric calibrations only lim ited by the capacity and resolution of the balance and handling capabilities. Standards that are calibrated for use in legal weights and measures applications shoul d be evaluated for conformance to the appropriate specifications and tolerances that apply. This procedure calculates the average volume based on two runs. NOTE: NIST calibrations generally make use of the average of five replicates. 2 Prerequisites 2.1 Verify that valid calibration certificates with appropriate values and uncertainties are available for all of the standards used in the calibration. All standards must have demonstrated metrological traceability to the international system of units (SI), which may be to the SI through a National Metrology Institute such as NIST. 2.2 Verify that the mass standards to be used have sufficiently small standard uncertainties for the level of calibration. Reference mass standards should not be used for gravimetric calibration due to the risk of water contamination. Weights of ASTM Class 2 or 3 or OIML Class F 1 or F 2 are recommended for this procedure. Working standards of other classes are generally not designed to maintain adequate stability needed; however, corrections obtained within a few days of the volume calibration may provide adequate stability and may be used if the uncertainty is sufficiently small and the density is available for performing buoyancy corrections.

January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 1.2.3 Verify that the balance used is in good operating condition with adequate capacity, sufficiently small resoluti on, and sufficiently small process standard deviation, as verified by a valid control chart or preliminary experiments using this procedure. NO TE: standard deviations obtained from mass calibrations do not reflect the process repeatability of gravimetric calibrations; therefore process repeatability must be obtained using this procedure! The accur acy of the balance and weighing procedures should be evaluated to minimize potential bias in the measurement process. 2.4 Verify that the operator is experi enced in precision weighing techniques and has had specific training in SOP 2, SOP 4, SOP 29, GMP 3, GMP 10, and gravimetric calibrations. 2.5 Verify that an adequate quality and supply of distilled or deionized water (see GLP 10) is available. Note: Do not use tap water for this procedure! 2.6 Verify that air currents are minimized in the laboratory when weighing is performed. Verify that the laboratory facilities meet the following minimum conditions to enable meeting the expected uncertainty that is achievable with this procedure: Table 1. Laboratory environmental conditions. Procedure Temperature Relative Humidity Gravimetric 20 C to 23 C Stable to ± 1 C / 1 h, durin g the calibration 40 % to 60 % Stable to ± 10 % / 4 h 2 Methodology 1 Scope, Precision, Accuracy The procedure is applicable for the calib ration of any size of measuring container that, when filled with water, will not overload the electronic balance used. Typical containers range in capacity from 1 mL to 20 L; however, this procedure is also applicable for larger provers provided that facility, equipment and standards meet the requirements in this SOP. When larger provers (e.g., 100 gal or more) are tested, also see the Test Notes in the Appendix. The procedure is generally only appropriate for micropi pettes when additional evaporation corrections are made. The precision of calibration depends on the care exercised in adjusting the various volumes and strict adherence to the various steps of the procedure. The accuracy attainable depends on the ability of th e operator to read and set the meniscus, uncertainties of the standard weights, the air buoyancy corrections, and thermal expansion corrections that are made.

January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 2.2 Summary The electronic balance used is calibrate d by incorporating standard masses into the procedure. The volumetric vessel to be calibrated is then weighed dry or “wetted down,” depending on whether the calibration is to be made on a “To Contain” or “To Deliver” basis. The cont ainer is filled with pure water of known temperature and re-weighed. The difference in mass is used to calculate the capacity of the container at the nominal capacity and at various capacities when multiple neck graduations are present. Transfer vessels may be used for all procedures except for flasks and containers marked “To Contain” (TC). 3 Standards and Equipment Requirements 3.1 An electronic balance having suffici ent capacity to weigh the loaded vessel is required. The balance selection affects the potential measurement errors associated with this procedure. Prior to use and where available, it is recommended to use the adjust/ca librate feature on balances. Option A provides a single point calibration fact or for the balance. In general, concerns are greater for balances or mass comparators larger than 5 kg due to corner loading errors, non-linearit y, and repeatability over the range of use. Option B as described in the cal culation section for larger volumes corrects for balance non-linearity in both the filled and empty/drained ranges of use. Option B will also likely be required on mass comparators that have multiple ranges. It also provides corrections for variations in air density that may occur over a longer weighing process on larger volumes. For all procedures in this SOP, the balance should be zeroed prior to each measurement to minimize possible effects due to balance drift. The sensitivity or resolution of the bala nce may be a limiting factor in the accuracy of the measurement. The re solution and repeatability must be smaller than the accepted uncertainty of the calibration. Linearity errors or additional uncertainties may need to be considered when the mass standards are slightly less than the volume or container being measured. 3.2 Sufficient quantity of calibrated mass standards. Mass standards are selected so that they are slightly larger than the combined mass of the volume and container or transfer vessel that will be weighed. When summations of masses are used, the summation mass is used, and the “effective density” must be calculated, taking care not to use “average” density values. 3.3 Thermometer with resolution and uncertainty less than 0.1 °C to determine water temperature. 3.4 Thermometer with resolution and uncertainty less than 0.50 °C to determine air temperature. 1

Note: Do not use tap water for this procedure! 3.8 Stopwatch or other suitable timing device (does not need to be calibrated.) 4 General Considerations 4.1 Cleanliness checks Verify that all containers to be calibrated are clean as evidenced by uniform drainage of water. No water droplets should remain on any interior surface as the water drains from the container. A reproducible “wet-down” weight is evidence for cleanliness in cases where it is not possible to visually check for uniform drainage. Use GMP 6 or 7 to clean vessels as necessary. All glassware must be meticulously cleaned, prior to calibration. When clean, the walls will be uniformly wetted. Instructions for cleaning are given in GMP 6 and GMP 7. An exception is plastic ware, which will not be wetted. Follow manufacturer's instructions for cleaning such vessels. Do not use cleaning agents that will attack, discolor, or swell plastic ware. 4.2 Use water that is thermally equilibra ted with the laboratory environment. Equilibration can be achieved by storing the water in clean containers in the laboratory. It is important to us e water that is equilibrated in the laboratory as much as possible to mi nimize potential calibration errors and convection currents during the calibration. Consider water to be equilibrated when within ± 5 °C of the laboratory temperature. 4.3 Volumetric calibrations to a marked volume (graduation line) are critically dependent on the setting of a meni scus. See GMP 3 for guidance in reading a meniscus. 4.4 Use GLP 13 as the procedure to dry any container to be calibrated on a “To Contain” basis. 4.5 Wet down (not used for any container calibrated “To Contain”) For glassware and hand-held test measures: Fill the container to capacity with distilled or deionized water, then empty over a 30 s period while avoiding splashing. Drain for 10 s unle ss another drain time is specified.

--- Page 4 ---
January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 (This is commonly called a “30 s pour, 10 s drain” emptying procedure.) A 30 s (± 5 s) pour followed by a 10 s drain, with the measure held between a 10 degree and 15 degree angle from vertical is required during calibration and use for glass flasks . A wet-down is not required for a transfer vessel that is used to weigh a delivered volume of water. For stationary provers: Fill the container to capacity with distilled or deionized water, then empty. Time the drain once the cessation of the main flow is complete for 30 s and close the valve. 5 Calibration Procedure for Burets 5.1 Clamp the buret vertically on a support stand. Also clamp a plain glass test tube or beaker, large enough to hold a th ermometer, in the vicinity of the buret. 5.2 Fill the buret with water and test fo r absence of leaks from the tip and stopcock. Drain and fill several times to condition the buret. Fill when ready to test. 5.3 Drain and record the delivery time, defined as the time of unrestricted flow from the zero mark to the lowest graduation mark with the stopcock fully open. 5.4 Fill the buret slightly above the zero mark with temperature-equilibrated water and also fill the test tube that holds the thermometer. Record the water temperature. 5.5 Set the meniscus on the zero mark and touch the tip with the wetted wall of a beaker to remove any excess water. The buret tip must be full. 5.6 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. 5.7 Zero the balance and then place a known mass standard on the balance pan that is slightly larger than the fille d capacity of the empty transfer vessel or flask when filled with water. Record the reading as O 5.8 Zero the balance and then weigh an empty transfer vessel or flask including the stopper or cover to be used. Record as O 2. 5.9 Fully open the stopcock and discharge th e contents of the buret into the previously weighed flask or transfer vessel. The tip of the buret should be in contact with the wall of the flask. Wh en the level in the buret is within a few millimeters above the line being calibrated, slow the discharge and

January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 make an accurate setting. When the setting is completed, move the flask horizontally to break contact with the tip. Recheck the setting. 5.10 Stopper (or cover) the filled transfer vessel or flask. Check to make sure that the outside of the transfer vessel or flask is not wet. Zero the balance and then weigh the filled transfer vessel or flask. Record the balance reading as O 5.11 Measure and record the temperature of water in the container. 5.12 Test the next interval in the same manner - from the zero mark to the next interval of test. 5.13 For burets with a specified waiting time, empty as in 2.5.9 to within a few millimeters of the calibration mark. Pause for the specified waiting time (e.g., 10 s), then adjust the meniscus to the graduation line as in 2.5.9. 5.14 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. 5.15 Make a duplicate determination for each interval (Run 2). 5.16 Calculate the volume for each interval as described in Section 3, Option A. 6 Calibration Procedure for Pipets (One-Mark) 6.1 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. 6.2 Zero the balance and then place a known mass standard on the balance pan that is slightly larger than the fille d capacity of the empty transfer vessel or flask when filled with water. Record the reading as O 6.3 Zero the balance and then weigh an empty transfer vessel or flask, including the stopper or cover that will be used. Record the balance reading as O 2. 6.4 Fill the pipet to the index mark and measure the delivery time with the tip in contact with the internal surface of a beaker (not the transfer vessel that will be used.) 6.5 Refill the pipet by suction, slightly a bove the index line. Record the water temperature. Wipe tip with filter pape r, then slowly lower level to the index line, using a stopcock or pinch cl amp for fine control. The tip must

January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 be in contact with the wetted wall of the beaker while this setting is being made. Do not remove any water remaining on tip at this time. 6.6 Hold the pipet in a vertical position and deliver water into the previously weighed transfer vessel or flask, with the tip in contact with the inside wall or neck. 6.7 After flow has ceased, wait two sec onds then remove the pipet from contact with the flask. Check to make su re that the outside of the transfer vessel or flask is not wet. 6.8 Stopper (or cover) the filled transfer vessel or flask. Zero the balance and then weigh the transfer vessel or flask. Record the balance reading as O 3. 6.9 Measure and record the temperature of water in the container. 6.10 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. 6.11 Make a duplicate determination for the pipet (Run 2). 6.12 Calculate the volume as described in Section 3, Option A. 7 Calibration of Flasks (To Contain) – Transfer vessel must not be used. 7.1 Clean and dry the flask to be calibrated as described in GLP 13. Then stopper the flask. 7.2 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. 7.3 Zero the balance and then place a known mass standard on the balance pan that is slightly larger than the fille d capacity of the flask when filled with water. Record the reading as O 7.4 Zero the balance and then weigh th e dry flask including its stopper or cover. Record the balance reading as O 2. 7.5 Place an appropriate sized funnel in n eck and fill the flask to just below the reference graduation while maneuvering the flask to wet the entire neck below the stopper. Let stand for two minutes then adjust the meniscus to the reference graduation line, taking care to avoid wetting the neck above the capacity graduation. 7.6 Check that the outside surface of the flask, and its internal surface above the water level are dry, and that neither bubbles or foam are present in the water. Remove visible water droplets if needed with a laboratory wipe.

January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 Stopper or cover the flask. 7.7 Zero the balance and then weigh the filled flask and its stopper or cover, and record the balance reading as O 3. 7.8 Measure and record the temperature of the water in the flask or other container. 7.9 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. 7.10 Make a duplicate determination (Run 2) after drying the flask per GLP 13. 7.11 Perform volume calculations as described in Section 3, Option A. 8 Calibration of Flasks (To Deliver) 8.1 Clean but do not dry the flask to be calibrated. Condition the flask by filling and emptying the flask over a 30 s period by gradually inclining it to avoid splashing. When the main flow has ceased, hold the flask in a nearly vertical position for 10 seconds unless another drain time is specified, then touch off the drop of water adhering to the tip of the flask. 8.2 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. 8.3 Zero the balance and then place a known mass standard on the balance pan that is slightly larger than the fille d capacity of the flask when filled with water. Record the reading as O 8.4 Zero the balance and then weigh the drained (empty) flask including its stopper or cover. Record the balance reading as O 2. 8.5 Fill the flask to just below the refere nce graduation. Let the flask stand for two minutes, then adjust the meniscus to the reference graduation line. Do not dry the inside of the flask above the graduation line, but take care to ensure that the outside of the flask is dry. 8.6 Zero the balance and then weigh the filled vessel, with cap or stopper. Record the balance reading as O 3. 8.7 Measure and record the temperature of the water in the flask. 8.8 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity.

--- Page 8 ---
January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 8.9 Make a duplicate determination (Run 2). 8.10 Calculate the volume of the flask as described in Section 3, Option A. Note: The order of weighing the filled and drained flask in Section 2.8 may be reversed. In that case, the filled vessel is still weighed and recorded as O 3, the flask is drained as in 2.8.1, and the properly drained vessel is weighed and recorded as O 2. 9 Calibration of Other Volumetric Glassware 9.1 Measuring Pipets (non-single-mark) – Ca librate in a manner similar to that used to calibrate burets (2.5). 9.2 Graduated Cylinders – Calibrate in a manner similar to that used for flasks (To Deliver cylinders, use section 2.8; To Contain cylinders, use section 7). 10 Calibration of Slicker-Plate Type Standards 10.1 This calibration makes use of Option B where equivalent mass standards are used at both the filled and empty loads on the balance. A transfer vessel is recommended. 10.2 Condition the slicker-plate type standa rds with several wet-down runs to fully ensure wet down and smooth valve operation. 10.3 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. 10.4 Zero the balance and then place a standard mass, M S1, on the balance platform (M S1 should be slightly larger than the mass of the drained vessel, dry vessel, or empty transfer vessel.) Record reading as O 1. 10.5 Zero the balance. Place the dry or “wet-down” transfer vessel on the balance platform, as appropriate, and record reading as O2. Caution: all containers must be dry on the outside for all weighing. 10.6 Fill the slicker-plate standard to just above the rim of the standard. Record the water temperature. Slide the slicker plate across the level top. Set the transfer vessel below the nozzle to ensu re all volume is transferred into the vessel and that no splashing occurs. 10.7 Open the slicker-plate standard valve and remove the plate simultaneously and smoothly to deliver the water into the transfer vessel. Time the drain for 30 s after cessation of the main fl ow and close the valve. Cover the transfer vessel and move it from beneath the standard to ensure additional

January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 drops of water are not transferred. Note: never fill the transfer vessel while it is sitting on the balance platform to ensure that the balance is not damaged with water and to avoid errors associated with balance drift and hysteresis. 10.8 Zero the balance and then place a standard mass, M S2, on the balance platform ( MS2 should be slightly larger than the mass of the filled vessel.) Record the balance reading as O3. 10.9 Zero the balance and then weigh the filled transfer vessel and record the balance reading as O4. 10.10 Immediately after weighing, check the temperature of the water in the filled container. Ensure that the water has not changed by more than 0.2 °C during the measurement process or repeat the run. 10.11 Measure and record the air temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity. 10.12 Make a duplicate determination (Run 2). 10.13 Calculate the volume as described in Section 3, Option B. 11 Calibration of Hand-held Graduated Neck Type Provers 11.1 A hand-held test measure is weighed empty and filled much like the procedure for To Deliver flasks (section 2.8). However, this calibration makes use of Option B where equivalent mass standards are used at both the filled and empty loads on the balance. 11.2 Condition the test measure by filling and draining using a 30 s pour followed by a 10 s drain. Take care to avoid splashing of water on the outside of the measure. The wet-down will help equilibrate the test measure with the water temperature. 11.3 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. 11.4 Zero the balance and then place standard masses, M S1, on the balance platform (M S1 should be slightly larger than the mass of the drained vessel.) Record reading as O 1. 11.5 Zero the balance and then place the “wet-down” test measure on the balance platform, and record the balance reading as O2. Caution: all containers must be dry on the outside for all weighing.

January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 2.11.6 Fill the graduated neck type test measure to just below the nominal volume mark. Record the water temperature. Adjust the meniscus to nominal. 11.7 Zero the balance and then place standard masses, M S2, on the balance platform ( MS2 should be slightly larger than the mass of the filled vessel.) Record the balance reading as O3. 11.8 Zero the balance and then weigh the filled transfer vessel and record the balance reading as O4. 11.9 Immediately after weighing, check the temperature of the water in the filled container. Ensure that the water has not changed by more than 0.2 °C since step 2.11.6 or repeat the run. 11.10 Measure and record the air temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity. 11.11 Make a duplicate determination (Run 2). 11.12 Calculate the volume as described in Section 3, Option B. You may use the average water temperature in ca lculations. If a neck scale plate verification is performed, additional weighings may be performed after setting the meniscus at each level. 12 Calibration of Large Volume Graduated Neck Type Provers 12.1 This calibration makes use of Option B where approximately equivalent mass standards are used at both the filled and empty loads on the balance. A transfer vessel is recommended. The unknown vessel to be calibrated must be elevated to facilitate transfer of water into the transfer vessel. 12.2 Condition the prover with a wet-down run to fully ensure smooth valve operation, temperature equilibration, and wet-down of the delivery system. 12.3 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. 12.4 Zero the balance and then place standard masses, M S1, on the balance platform (M S1 should be slightly larger than the mass of the drained vessel, dry vessel, or empty transfer vessel.) Record reading as O 1. 12.5 Zero the balance. Place dry or “wet- down” transfer vessel including cover on balance platform, as appropriate, and record reading as O2. Caution: all containers must be dry on the outside for all weighing.

January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 2.12.6 Fill the graduated neck type prover to just below the nominal volume mark. Record the water temperature. Adjust the meniscus to nominal. Set the transfer vessel below the nozzle to ensure all volume is transferred into the vessel and that no splashing occurs. Use hoses and piping of minimum length to avoid errors associated with retention during delivery. Hoses should be translucent so that cessation of the main flow is visible. Care should be taken to ensure that there are no loops or sags in the hose that may hold water. When using hoses or piping, be sure to include them as part of the wet-down process. 12.7 Open the unknown prover valve to deliv er the water into the transfer vessel. Time the drain for 30 s after the cessation of the main flow and close the valve. Cover the transfer vessel and move it from beneath the prover to ensure additional drops of water are not transferred. 12.8 Zero the balance and then place standard masses, M S2, on the balance platform ( MS2 should be slightly larger than the mass of the filled vessel.) Record the balance reading as O3. 12.9 Zero the balance and then weigh the filled transfer vessel and its cover. Record the balance reading as O4. 12.10 Immediately after weighing, check th e temperature of the water in the filled container. The temperature shoul d not change by more than 0.2 °C if the prover and water have been equilibrated in the laboratory environment. 12.11 Measure and record the air temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity. 12.12 Make a duplicate determination (Run 2). 12.13 Calculate the volume as described in Section 3, Option B. You may use the average water temperatures for calculations. 3 Calculations 1 Option A – One-point balance calib ration.

Compute the mean V20 for the duplicate measurements. 4 Test measures and provers are typi cally calibrated to 60 °F. Compute V60, the volume at 60 F, for each run, using the expression (taking care to use the cubical coefficient of expansion in °F-1): 5 If using a different reference temperat ure, use the following equation and take care to match the cubical coefficient of expansion units with the units of temperature:  ) 20 - t ( - 1 V Vt 20  20 1 20  t V Vt                 1 1 OO 1 OO 11 12 22 34 a w sa s sa s t M M V   t 1 ref ef  t V Vt r Eqn. 3.3 Eqn. 3.4  60 1 60  t V Vt Eqn. 3.5 Eqn. 3.2

Common reference temperatures for other liquids follow: Commodity Reference Temperature Frozen food labeled b y volume (e.g., fruit juice) -18 ºC (0 ºF) Beer 3.9 ºC (39.1 ºF ) Food that must be ke pt refri gerated (e.g., milk ) 4.4 ºC (40 ºF ) Distilled s pirits or petroleu m 15.56 ºC (60 ºF ) Petroleum (International Reference ) 15 ºC (59 ºF ) Com pressed Natural Gas (CNG ) 15 °C (60 ºF ) Wine 20 ºC (68 ºF) Unrefrigerated liquids (e.g., sold unchilled, like soft drinks) 20 ºC (68 ºF) Hydrogen (H 2) 21 ºC (70 ºF) Petroleum (Hawaii) 26.67 ºC (80 ºF) 7 Calculate and report the mean volume of the volumetric standard at its applicable reference temperature. If adjustments were made during replicate runs, report the “as found” volume or the mean of “as found” volumes and also th e “as left” volume or mean of “as left” volumes, as applicable, at the appropriate reference temperature. (I.e., do not calculate a mean value by combining “as found” and “as left” values when adjustments are made.) 4 Measurement Assurance 1 Duplicate the process with a suitable check standard (See GLP 1, SOP 30, in NISTIR 6969, or Sec. 7.4, in NBS Handbook 145) or conduct replicate measurements per SOP 17 or 20. Average values of the range or standard deviation of similarly sized flasks or volumetric standards may be tracked on a single range chart or standard devia tion chart according to SOP 17 or 20. For standards that may be and are adjusted, do not combine an “as found” value with an “as left” value for the two runs entere d into the chart; use the adjusted value from Run 1 and the value from Run 2, both at the applicable reference temperature, when entering values in a st andard deviation or range chart. Control chart run values must both be from either before adjustment or after adjustment. A minimum of 12 replicate measurements are required to establish initial process limits and 25 to 30 points are required for reporting valid uncertainty values. 2 Plot the calculated check standard volume and verify it is within established limits. A t-test may be incorporated to check the observed value against an accepted value. 3 The mean of the calculated check standard values is used to evaluate bias and drift over time and may be used to identify or signify problems with the volume standard or changes in water quality.

January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 4.4 Check standard observations are used to calculate the standard deviation of the measurement process, sp. 5 Assignment of Uncertainties The limits of expanded uncertainty, U, include estimates of the standard uncertainty of the mass standards used, uc, plus the measurement process repeatability, sp, and the additional items noted below and in the uncertainty budget table, Table 3, at approximately a 95 percent level of confidence. See SOP 29 for the complete standard operating procedure for calculating the uncertainty. 1 The standard uncertainty for the standards, u s, is obtained from the calibration report. The combined standard uncertainty, uc, is used and not the expanded uncertainty, U, therefore the reported uncertainty for the standard will usually need to be divided by the coverage factor k. Multiple mass standards are often used, so see SOP 29 for treatment of dependencies and correlations. 2 Standard deviation of the measuremen t process from control chart performance (See SOP No. 17 or 20.) The value for s p is obtained from the control chart data for check standards when a check standard is available using this pr ocedure. It may also be estimated based on replicate measurements over time. Replicate measurements over time may provide a pooled standard deviation that ma y be used or the average range is used to estimate the standard deviation per SO P 17 or 20. This standard deviation value is a repeatability factor related to the precision of the weighings and the setting of the meniscus when present, but does not include uncertainties associated with errors in reading the meniscus (See GMP 3.) 3 Include uncertainties associated with the reading of the meniscus when one is present. See GMP 3 for details. 4 Other standard uncertainties usually included at this calibration level include uncertainties associated with water temperature measurements, thermometer accuracy, calculation of air density, standa rd uncertainties associated with the density of the mass standards, coefficien ts of expansion, viscosity or surface effects on the volume of liquid clinging to vessel walls after draining, improper observance of drainage times, and the lack of internal cleanliness. 5 Example components to be considered fo r an uncertainty budget table are shown in Table 3. Multiple values may need to be considered in some cases.

January 2016 SOP 14 of 19 Appendix C Test Notes for Large Provers 1 Pour and drain times. It is impractical to completely drain a filled container, because some of the contents will remain as a film. By strict adherence to a specified procedure, the residual contents can be held essentially constant so that, repr oducible calibration constants can be obtained. The conventionally selected conditions are as follows: a. For bottom-drain containers: open drai n valve fully and allow contents to discharge at maximum rate. When flow ceases, wait 30 s, close valve, and touch off any drops adhering to spout. b. For pour-type containers: pour contents by gradually tilting container to an 85º angle, so that virtually all liquid is de livered in 30 s. Allow to drain for an additional 10 s, then touch off any drops adhering to the lip. The instructions described above must be precisely followed during calibration and use of the calibrated vessels. 2 Evaporation losses. A suitable cap should be placed on the top of open vessels to minimize evaporation losses. If used, the cap must be included in all weighings. 3 Slicker-plate. When a slicker-plate standard is calibrated, th e plate should be used to fix the water level in it. A transfer vessel is recommended for use when calibrating a slicker-plate type standard. But if the standard is weighed, th e plate must be weighed with the standard during each such operation.
