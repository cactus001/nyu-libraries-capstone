procurem ent process that has produced too few long-term power purchase agreem ents; the need for new and upgraded transm ission to access renewable resources, and the need to understand the impact of integrati ng larg e am ounts of interm ittent renewab les into th e electricity g rid. We caution, however, that th e intermittency “barrier ” is presently one of percep tion; it m ay be determ ined in a recen tly in itiated P IER study that sig nificant quantities of wind can be added to the syst em without im posing significant costs or requiring significant changes in system resources or operating procedures. We urge th e Commiss ion to make certa in mo difica tions in its final r eport. As th e Draft Report amply indicates, there is plenty of work to do if the RPS goals are going to be met, so w e should avoid spending time on solutions that do not address real p roblems. We strongly urge the Commission to re move the Draft Report’s call for the development of statewide protocols for studying avia n mortality to address site-specific impacts. Staff docum ents in support of th e Energy Report process never suggested that existing sets of protocols are inadequate, nor has staff studied local siting processes in the state. Wind facilities in California are sited w ith appropriate environm ental review, which is why the Altam ont avian fatality problem rem ains unique. CalWEA does, however, support a set of protocols issued by the National W ind Coordinating Comm ittee and cite d by staff; these protocols were authored by a for mer staff m ember of this Commission. We would support a Commission recommendation that local siting authorities a dopt these protocols for use when they deem studies to be necessary. Giving additional weight to study protocols would require an am endm ent to CEQA. The lead lo cal agencies und er CEQA ar e best equ ipped to ta ilor studies to s ite- specific circum stances (which can differ with in each individual wind resource area). We urge the Comm ission to rem ove the thr ee options proposed in the Draf t Report to simplify adm inistration of the RPS program . None of these options actually address the barriers and problem s that were correc tly iden tified as the m ajor obstacles to achieving RPS goals, and they would create problem s of the ir own. Pursuing them would require legislation and m ore implem entation, which would divert years of tim e and attention away from addressing issu es that are worthy of attention. Instead of highlighting these solutions , the final report should focus on other recomm endations that are m ade which do us efully addres s the identified problem s, such as: (a) sim plifying and standardizing power purchase contracts; (b) improving the transpa rency and unif ormity of utility procurem ent proces ses; and (c ) involving th e CAISO in planning for transm ission to m eet RPS goals. In addition to the reco mmendatio ns add ressed above, there are s everal additional ways in which the Commission can and sh ould advance the RPS goals, which are not included in the Draft R eport, but should be reflected in th e final one. The Comm ission should engage the CAISO in its PIER Interm ittency Analysis P roject (IAP). W e believe this important project is missing an im portant opportunity to engage 2

--- Page 2 ---
the CAISO at the h ighest levels to en sure that it s upports th e methods that will b e employed in the effort. The Draft Report states that the CAISO should undertake a similar res earch in itiativ e. Rather th an encourage a duplic ation of efforts, the Comm ission should include the CAISO in its own efforts to ensure that it will be comf ortable with the res ults and can imm ediately take further actions from there. The Comm ission should produce system integra tion cost inform ation for application to RPS bids (integration cost adde rs). The RPS statute requires that the utilities conside r the system integra tion c osts and cap acity v alues associated w ith renewable resource bids. To date, the CPUC has relied upon in form ation from the CEC’s studies for this inform ation, but we do not have this inform ation for significant additional quantities of renewable r esources, w hich the CP UC will nee d in approv ing renewables-re lated transm ission upgrades. As far as we can determ ine, the Comm ission has no effort underway to produce this inform ation, which is needed to advance the state’s RPS goals. W e strongly encourage the Commission to ensure that this gap is filled, either as part of the IAP, or from a separate effort. The Comm ission should ensure that WREGIS tracks energy deliveries. The Draft Report m entions the im portance of assuring th at RPS energy is ac tually d elivered in to the state, but the Comm ission has not taken steps to achieve that through the W REGIS system . The Comm ission should develop guidelines for issuing SEP paym ents so that there w ill be no delays should SEPs be required. Finally, w e believe that the Draft Repor t’s cr iticis ms of FERC on the Tehachapi “trunk line” decision are misgu ided, and should be replaced w ith a di scussion of the tools that the state should be using to ach ieve California’s RPS transmission goals. We do not agree that FE RC “rem oved the prim ary instrum ent the state could have used to address transm ission constraints for re newab les” and “effectiv ely bar[red] the advanced planning and construction of transm ission facilities.” Once SCE characterized the trunk line as being devoi d of network benefits, FERC had no legal option but to dism iss the notion of charging transm ission custom ers for it. FERC deserves significant credit for using its leg al flexibility to gran t SCE’s reques t to enable it to build transm ission f acilities in advance of genera tor in terconnection requests. FERC had no obligation to do th is; it reached far b eyond what it had ev er done before, and should be comm ended for it. Rather than lodge unfounded com plaints ag ainst FERC, the Comm ission should place the focus on the other recommendations that the Draf t Report m akes rela ted to th is issue - - modifying the C AISO tarif f to give the C AISO the ability to con sider sta te policy goals (p. 86) and encouraging com prehensive transm ission planning efforts by the Comm ission, the CP UC and the CAISO. 3

--- Page 3 ---
In addition, the Comm ission should highlight th e need for the CPUC to us e its statutory authority under PU Code Section 399.25 (a ) to prom ote transm ission upgrades that provide network benefits while tapping th e state’s m ajor renewable resou rce areas (with costs therefore recoverable from all transmission cu stomers), and (b) to ensu re that those up grades are financed by th e tran smission owner. Had the CPUC used this tool effectively in the S CE’s “trunk line” case, the upgrade could have been approved the first tim e around without the need for any m ajor changes in FERC’s current approach to transm ission cost recovery. To m eet California’s RPS goals, we need to learn from this m istake. II. COMMENTS ON WIND-AVI AN ISSUES A. The Commission Should Remove the Draft Report’s Call for Develop ment of Statew ide Protocols for Studyin g Avian Mortality The Draft Energy Report (p. 103) calls for “ developing statew ide protocols for studying avian m ortality to addres s site-specific im pacts in each ind ividual wind res ource area” (emphasis added). No explanation was provide d. Staff doc uments supporting the Integrated Energy Policy Report (IEPR) process on this issu e suggested that “[s]tatewide guidelines for wind energy projects m ay be an appropriate way to gain consistency statewide when developing and m itigating projec ts”1 but did not suggest that exis ting protocols are inadequate. Staff cited protocols issued by the National Wind Coordinating Comm ittee (NW CC) and the U.S. Fish & W ildlife Service (USFWS). Indee d, the lead author of the NWCC docum ent was the Comm ission’s own Richard Anderson, a wildlif e ecologist and then-project m anager for avian-wind studies. CalWEA supports th e NWCC protocols,2 and would support a Comm ission recomm endation that lo cal siting authorities ad opt those protocols for use when they deem studies to be necessary. For the protocols to carry greater weight than a recomm endat ion would require an am endm ent to CEQA. Regarding adapting the protoco ls for each wi nd resource area, as the N WCC protocols state: In jurisdictions requiring bird research, the inform ation in this docum ent can be used to develop standard operating pro cedures (SOPs) and/ or study designs. However, many situ ations will require site-sp ecific knowledge and expert recomm endations as to which study design and m ethods are most appropriate. The lead local agencies under CEQA are best equipped to tailor stud ies to site-specific circum stances (which can differ within each indi vidual wind resource area). Staff docum ents 1 California E nergy Comm ission Staff Report, “Asse ssment of Avian Mortalit y from Collisions and Electrocutions” (CEC-700-2005- 015). June 2005 . 2 Indeed, had these protocols been followed by the authors of the 2004 PIER report discussed below, that stud y would n ot now be the subject of considerable controversy. 4

--- Page 4 ---
in support of the IEPR process did no t study th e local s iting p rocesses in California, let alon e provide any evidence that they are not working. That m odern wind facilities in Calif ornia are sited with appropriate environm ental review is evidenced by th e absence of significant facility- related av ian mortality outside the Altam ont. For exam ple, in Solano County where avia n impacts are a concern, the county has extens ive pre-construction and post-constructio n monitoring procedures in place, which are specific to local topographic f eatures and avian populations. The county has also imposed appropriate m itigation m easures.3 The developers in Solano County also engaged local USFWS offi cials in inform al discussions concer ning their proposed projects, and the Service had no objections. In the Altam ont, the area of prim ary concern, the county’s newly adopted program to identif y effective m itigation m easures will be inf ormed by an independent Scientific Review Comm ittee, including two m embers appointed by state and federal wildlife author ities, which will r eport to cou nty officials. The Comm ission should therefore delete the recommendation to develop statewide protocols, and should not endeavor to devel op site-specific guidelines for the unlim ited number of site-specific situ ations that m ay arise. B. The Draft Energy Report Correctly Expresses Caution Regarding a CEC Consultant Report on Wind-Avian Issues CalWEA strongly supports and appreciates th e statem ent (p. 102) which appropriately casts doubt upon the scientific validity of the findings of the 2004 PIER report by Smallwood and Thelander. The Draft Report correctly iden tifies som e of the serious flaws in the study (“[i]nadequate access to certain turbines, tim e lapses between surveys, length of survey period, and various extrapo lation techniqu es”) which ca ll into qu estion the m ortality estim ates m ade in the study as well as the v alidity of the proposed mitig ation m easures, which the Draft Report appropriately labels as “experim ental.”4 Unfortunately, the consultant report has alr eady taken on a life of its own. Despite the flaws cited in the Draft Energy Report, th e mitigation m easures propos ed in the 200 4 PIER report will n everth eless be im plem ented wit hout further testing in essentially all non- repowered wind projects in Alam eda County (though they will b e monitored clos ely for effectivenes s by the Scie ntific Revie w Committe e). More w orrisom e is that the un tested measures – which were developed based on obsolet e turb ines in the Alta mont terrain – have been raised by siting officials around the country as potentially appropriate in areas where 3 Commissio n Staff is apparently unaware of the mitigation m easures adopted for Solano Count y projects. In its response to filed commen ts, sta ff state s “We are una ware of any significant m easures other then [ sic] monitoring (which is not mitigati on) occurring at ot her California wind farms to reduce avian collision.” (CEC Staff Response to Public Comments, August 31, 2005, at PDF-page 129.) 4 At the October 6 IEPR hearing, proponents of th is study asserted that (even if the m ortality estimates are wrong), the m ortality associations with partic ular turbines (on which the proposed m itigat ion measures ar e based) are co rrect becaus e they were based on actual carcas ses found, not esti mates. We disagree. The mortality associations suffer fro m many of the same flaws as the mortality estimates. (For m ore dis cussion, see Appendix 1, footnote 2.) 5

--- Page 5 ---
avian m ortality is no t remotely comparable to th e unique pro blem at the Altam ont. CalW EA is concerned that Comm ission staff, who also erro neously be lieve tha t the model is app licab le outside the Altam ont, will continu e to prom ote its use m ore broadly. Because of the traction that the 2004 PIER report has gained, CalWEA ha s requested that the Commission conduct an outside independent review of the scientif ic validity of the report’s conclusions; Commission managem ent has ag reed to seek such an assessm ent and we look forward to the resu lts. The win d operato rs in the Altam ont Pass are comm itted, and now obligated, to finding ways to reduce avian m ortality, but no one is served by widely implementing m easures that m ay prove ineffective or counter-productive. An independent review of the 2004 PIER report is especially warranted in view of the staff’s inadequate response to i ndustry criticism s of that report, as we explain in an attached appendix. C. The Commission Should Not Cite the Flaw ed 2004 PIER Study as an Important Source of Know ledge The Draft Energy Report states (p. 101), "Ca lifornia has an importa nt opportunity to more carefully site new turbines based on knowle dge of bird flight pa tterns, thereby reducing and avoiding bird deaths from wind turbines ." In support of this statem ent, a 2005 staff docum ent is cited which, in turn, is based on the behavioral observations from the 2004 PIER report. That reference should be removed, for several reasons. First, in ligh t of the Draf t Energy Report’s subsequent st atem ent ca lling into question the scientific validity of the 2004 PIER report (d iscussed in section II.A. 2, above), this report should not be referenced as an im portant source of knowledge regarding turbine siting.5 Second, as we stated in the pr evious section, the 2004 PIER Repor t is specific to the Altam ont terrain, and is therefore not appl icable to the repowering of proj ects els ewhere in California. And, finally, when avian issues are a concern w ith proposed repowers outside of the Altam ont, the indus try conducts pre-constructio n avian s tudies and uses the results w hen turb ine siting decisions are m ade. III. COMMENTS ON WIND REPOWER ISS UES A. The Draft Energy Report Appropriately Encourages the CPUC to Promote Repow ers, and Could Be More Specific CalWEA strongly supports th e Draft Report’s recomm endation (p. 103) that the “CPUC quickly develop new Qualif ying Facility contra cts to overcom e impedim ents to repowering and take advantage of the Federal Production Tax Cr edit” (P TC) to help achieve 5 As explained in an appendix to these comment s, the underl ying data used to identify "problem turbines" suffers fro m an a bsence of controls for b ackground m ortality, incons istent search fre quencies and search ar eas, inconsist ent study durations , and a l ikelihood of c arcass double-counting. 6

--- Page 6 ---
the goals of reducing avian fatalities in the Al tamont Pass and to help m eet the s tate’s RPS goals. The CPUC has not taken any specific acti ons to prom ote repowers, despite having identified repowering as an im portant goal. As CalW EA state d in rec ent comments to the CPUC,6 there is one action that the CPUC could ta ke to prom ote repowers in the short term (i.e., that wo uld accelerate repowerin g beyond the schedule required by Alam eda County): it could strongly encourage PG&E (and Edison) to offer contract am endm ents that allow project owners to re tain the f ull value of their exis ting co ntrac ts for th eir historical (or contrac t- estim ated) d eliveries when they repo wer, and to pay short-run avoide d costs for additional deliveries. The CPUC has alrea dy adopted contract am endm ents that provide for this, but the utilities have been unwilling to offer them broadly. B. Suggested Corrections for Accura cy There are a num ber of statem ents in th e Draft Energy Report that could be m ore accurate if modified. Repowering progress The Draft IEPR states (p. 102), “To date, California has m ade only lim ited progress toward repo wering wind facilities, w ith only 37 MW of repowered wind contra cts su bmitted by SCE to the CPUC as of July 2005.” In a ddition to those contracts (which have been approved), the CPUC ha s approved two repower contracts with PG&E totaling between 45.7 and 60.7 MW. (This includes th e 17.7 M W Diablo W inds project, which was recently completed, and a contract for the repowering of the Buena Vista pro ject, totaling betw een 28 and 43 MW , which is expected to be com pleted in m id-2006.) Thus, the statem ent could be more accurately restated as fo llows: “To date, California h as made limited progress toward repowering wind f acilities, with only 83-98 M W of repowered wind c ontrac ts sub mitted by SCE and PG&E to the C PUC as of August 2005.” Alam eda County requirem ents On p. 102, the Draft Energy Report states, “C urrently, neither Alam eda County nor the wind industry proposes to repower the entire Altamont Pass; both are focused instead on renewing existing perm its, with a proposed c ondition that repowering would only occur over 13 years.” This statem ent would be more accura tely rephrased as follows: “Alam eda County adopted a requirem ent in Septem ber 2005 that will require all existing wind projects in Alam eda County to be repowered within 13 years.” On p. 92, the Draft Energy Report states, “planni ng officials in the Altam ont area have placed a m oratorium on perm its for both new a nd repowered wind facilities until they are confident that steps have been taken to reduce bird deaths.” T his statem ent could m ore 6 CPUC Docket R.04-04- 026, “Repl y Comments of the California Wind Energ y Association on the Proposed Decision of ALJ Simon Regarding Long-Te rm RPS Plans” (October 3, 2005). 7

--- Page 7 ---
precis ely read, “planning officials in Alam eda County have placed a m oratorium on perm its in that coun ty pending co mpletion of an EIR th at will cons ider repower ing as well as new technologies and siting possibilitie s. At the sam e time, county officials imposed a perm it condition that requires perm it holders to repower 10% of their turbines in year four, 35% in year eight, 85% in year 10, and 100% in year 13.” U.S. tax code restrictions on repowers The last sentence in the following statem ent (p. 102) is not entirely accurate: “[P]rovisions in the U.S. Tax Code (Secti on 45) prevent repowere d wind f acilities with existing standard offer contracts from qua lifying for the producti on tax credit unless the contract is am ended so that any wind generation in excess of historical production levels is e ither sold to th e utility at it s curren t avoided cos t or sold to a th ird party.[ footnote om itted] This provis ion discoura ged wind operato rs from repowering because u tility avoided costs are m uch lo wer than curren t contract p rices. The last sentence should be rephrased as fo llows: “This provision has discouraged wind operato rs from repowering because, in additi on to lim iting th e pric e paid for addition al delive ries resulting f rom the repowe r, the utiliti es have, with a few exceptions, been un willing to allow developers to r etain the f ull valu e of their exis ting co ntracts for th eir cu rrent delivery levels (or contract-estim ated deliveries) and have required proposed repowers to engage in costly b idding processe s rathe r than f acilita te rep owers throu gh bilateral negotia tions .” IV. COMMENTS ON RPS BARRIERS, PROBL EMS & SOLUTIONS A. Some of the Barriers to Achievin g RPS Goals Identified in the Draft Report are On Target; Others Sho uld Be Modified We share th e Draft Energy Report’s concern ( p. 92) that renewable energy procurem ent under the Renewables Po rtfolio Stand ard (RPS) law is not pro ceeding as q uickly as needed to reach the state’s RPS goals by 2010. And we agr ee largely w ith th e Draft Report’s assessm ent (p. 89) of the barriers that m ust be overc ome for the state to m eet its RPS goals: • The lack o f long-term purchase agreemen ts for pow er. We agree th at this is a problem , and that it stem s from other problem s that the Draf t Report ide ntifies (p. 92 ) – namely, an overly com plex procurem ent pro cess for renewables (p. E-5) and unclear and non-transparent least-cost, best-fit pol icies employed by invest or-owned utilities (IOUs). • The need for new and/or upgraded transmis sion to acces s renew able resources (see subsections D and E, below, for more discussion on this issue), and • The impact of in tegrating larg e amount s of intermitten t renew able resources into the e lectricity gr id. We urge the Comm ission to clar ify, however, that presently the bar rier is the perception of impacts, rather than actual ones. As the Dr aft Report 8

--- Page 8 ---
notes elsewhere (p. 90 -91, p. 100), the operation al cons traints posed by interm ittent renewables in the near term are m anageable and do not im pose significant costs on the system , and the Comm ission’s PIER program has a sophisticated research effort underway th at will asses s the im pacts of integrating large am ounts of interm ittent renewable resources into California’s syst em. Based on experience in other system s with m uch higher wind energy penetrations than we have here, the Comm ission should reserv e judg ment as to whether a la rge incr ease in wind energ y on our sys tem will be a significant barrier to achieving RPS goals. We agree th at the f ourth barrier iden tified in the Draf t Report – the lack of repow ering of aging w ind facilities – should be addressed to contribut e toward RPS goals and to reduce the avian f atality leve ls unique to the A ltamont. However, the quantity of additional generation associated with repowers is sm all in c omparison to the over all RPS goals.7 Therefore, a failure of the ut ilities to secure additional en ergy through repowers should not, by itself, be co nsidered a major ba rrier to achieving RPS goals on a par with providing transm ission access to major renewable resou rce areas o r simplifying the procurem ent process. B. We Agree With the R PS Implementation Problems Identified in th e Draft Report, and Encourage the Commission to Add Others The Draft Energy Report (p. 92) has identifi ed three prim ary problem s with the RPS program : • The lack of transparency in the bidding, ranking, a nd contracting processes, • The administrative complexity of the program, and • The uneve n application of RPS targets to all r etail se llers in the state. We agree th at these are m ajor problem s that req uire rem edies. W e would also id entify as prim ary problem s the CPUC’s i mplem entation of the transm ission planning and cost recovery provisions of the RPS statute, and the developm ent of transm ission cost adders, which we discuss further below in subsections D and E. C. The Draft Report’s Proposed Solutions to RP S Problems Do Not Al ways Address the Identified Barriers an d Problems Some of the Draft Energy Report’s propos als to improve the RPS i mplementation process are on target; others do not address th e barriers and problem s identified in th e Draf t Report or experienced by CalWEA m embers. The three options proposed to si mplify administra tion of the RPS program do not address the identified problems 7 If the entire fleet of approxim ately 1,000 MW second- and t hird-generation tur bines were repowered, energy production from those facilities would in crease by approximately one-third, adding the equivalent of a few hundred m egawatts of new wind generation to the sy stem . 9

--- Page 9 ---
The Draf t Report (p. 93 -94) iden tifies three options for sim plifying the adm inistration of the RPS program , none of which address the barriers and problem s prev iously id entified as major obstacles to achieving RPS goals, and a ll of which would be counter-productive. Moreover, these changes would re quire legis lative changes, whic h would divert years of tim e and energy f rom solving the real problem s. Thes e options should therefore be elim inated from the final d raft report. (a) Option 1 - Eliminatin g the market price referen t (MP R) and supplementa l energy payment (SEP) processes in favor of a standard reasonableness review process. While this change would sim plify the process, the Draft Report did no t identif y the MPR or SEP paym ent issues as a significant problem . Indeed, they are not: th e MPRs are transparen t figures; they were developed in a fairly effi cient manner through a working group and without hearings; they are rela tively non-controversial; and they are not involved in the resource selection process (the MPR serves only as a dividing line between contract paym ents and SEP paym ents). To date, no contracts have required SEP paym ents, so this cannot explain the lack of signed contracts. W e would add that the MP R process should get easier as the CPUC gains experience and estab lishes precedents; in add ition, the discussions this year on tim e-of- delivery MP Rs are likely to reduce the num ber of MPRs to just one. (b) Option 2 - Creating a single cut-o ff con tract price belo w which contracts would be judged reasonable, w ith co sts recoverable in utility rates. This methodology, employed in the pre-RPS “interim ” procurem ents, is lik ewise a imed at the MPR/SEP issue, which is not the problem. In addition, taking th is step cou ld well c reate far m ore controversy and delay than the current MPR/ SEP process. The “cut-off” c ontract price would be highly subjective and controversial – i ndeed, it would open up a fight that was se ttled (af ter long negotia tions ) with th e MPR/SEP provisions in th e RPS legislation : the u tilities must sign contracts up to the MPR price a nd must sign them until the SEP funds a re exhaus ted. Given current gas price forecasts, e xhausting the funds ought not to be an issue well past 2010. (c) Option 3 - Aw arding public funds fo r RPS contracts through auctions for production incentives (with awards conditioned on rece iving contracts through the R PS solicitation process). Once again, this solution ta rgets a non-problem : the application of SEP paym ents, which no contract has so far requir ed. Returning to th e Comm ission’s au ction process for subsidy paym ents when subsidies ar e not required obviously fails to address any real p roblem . We also note that a few other recomm enda tions m ade in the Draft Report (p. 94 and 96) are already being addresse d by the CPUC. Delivery flexib ility provisions adopted in CPUC Decision 05-07-0 39 (July 21, 2005) appro ving utility com pliance p lans and RFOs will enable inter-utility trades of renewables and shaped products, a nd a recent alternate proposed decision will, if adopted, enable the use of tradable renewable energy credits (RECs). Regarding the Draft Report’s recom mendation (p. 94) that shaped contracts should include the stored and shaped products offere d by the Bonneville Power A dministration which can delay deliveries by as m uch as a week, we ur ge the Comm ission to add a caution that such products should only be approved if it can be show n that they cause total in-state deliveries of 10

--- Page 10 ---
power to increase over the status quo in am ounts equivalent to the purchased power. Otherwise, California does not receive the in-state benefits of reduced in-state gas-fired generation. The Draft Report should focus on the useful solutions that it iden tifies While the D raft Energy Report highlights the above solutions, which we believe would not be helpf ul, it underplays other recommendati ons which do usefully address th e identified problem s and barriers. These recommendations shoul d receive greater play in the final report. (a) Standardi zed contracts w ould si mplify the procureme nt process. We strongly support the Draft Report’s recomm endation (p. 94) that the C PUC should develop standard power purchase contracts. CalW EA has consistently advocated greater standardization of terms since the incep tion of RPS i mplem entation. Unfortunately, our positions have been opposed by the utilities and not been adopted. We hope that this will chan ge in view o f the extens ive delays asso ciated with the recent renew able RFPs of all three utilities, which bear testam ent to the need to s tream line th e contract negotiation process. W e continue to believe that the complicated Edison Electric Institut e (“E EI”) form contrac t--an u nnecessa rily complicated and often inapplicab le set of contract term s and conditions--should not be used as the basis for RPS contracts. The utilities do deserve som e credit, however, for taking steps on their own to reduce bidding hurdles; for exam ple, SCE abandoned the EEI contract in its latest solicitation, and PG&E and SCE ha ve lowered their bid deposit requirements. Much more could and should be done, however , to reduce the cost and tim e associated with bidding, which serves to reduce the num ber of participants and drive up costs. (b) Grea ter transparen cy and uniformity o f the bid evalua tion process is necessary. We strongly support the Dr aft Report’s call (p. E -3, 45) for more open and transpa rent utility p rocurement processes and (p. 92) for m ore consistent and transp arent le ast- cost, best-fit m ethods used by IOUs to rank RPS bidders. Bidders’ confidence in the process is underm ined by the inability to de termine whether IOUs are selec ting truly least-cost, best-fit projects, or whether there is sign ificant subje ctivity in th e pro cess. Reduced confidence in the process redu ces the num ber of partic ipants in the process, wh ich redu ces com petition and drives up costs. W e believe that the renewa bles and non-renewables procurem ent processes should result in procurem ents that together meet RPS goals and overa ll energy needs at the least-cost. The utilities should not select higher-cost renewables in order to m eet a particular system need if a com bination of low er-cost renewables and non-renewables can m eet those needs at a lo wer overall cost. With a very transparent pr ocess, we would support the elimination of th e Procurement Review Group (PRG) . In the absence of such a process, however, the PRG is necessary to provide som e degree of oversight of the process . The PRG has becom e an excuse for secrecy, however, an d it should b e replaced w ith a transp arent pro cess. (c) The CAISO should be involved in pla nning transmission to meet R PS goals. We agree with the Draft Report’s recomm endations (pp. 86, 99) that (a) the CPUC, the Commission and the CAISO should immediately investigate changes to the CA ISO tariff that 11

--- Page 11 ---
would allow recognition of transm ission needs no t only for reliability and econom ic projects, but also to access renewable projects to m eet RPS goals, and (b) the three agencies should cooperate to revise the tran smission cost adder process for R PS procurem ent to m ore accurately reflect trans mission costs and re duce existing dis incentiv es for renewab les. In recent comments at the CPUC, CalW EA enc ouraged that comm ission to request that the CAISO consider the necessity of m eeting the state’s renewable energ y goals in th e planning efforts it has underway.8 Specifically, the CAISO c ould in tegrate the work that it has already done for the Tehachapi Collaborative Study Group (TCSG), and any sim ilar work for the Im perial Valley Study Group, into their larger effort. W e also encouraged the CP UC to consider taking form al action at FERC to ensu re that the CAISO’s future planning efforts encom pass state po licy g oals. If the CAISO can proactively consider th e transm ission upgrades that w ould m ost efficiently connect th e largest con centrations of le ast-cost renewable resources, it could help to solve th e problem s identif ied in the Draf t Repor t (p. 99)—nam ely, the failure of the C PUC to consider the network benefits associated w ith transm ission upgrades, and the inappropriate practice of some utilities in load ing u pgrade cos ts onto renew ables b ids. For exam ple, a prelim inary analys is by the CAISO of a Tehach api-Midway connection recently prep ared for the TCSG shows that the north-of-P ath-26 c ongestion previously estim ated by PG&E is virtu ally elim inated when the Tehachapi wind res ource is effectiv ely in tegrated into the overa ll network. The congestion estim ated by PG&E has resulted in the application of significant transm ission adders to th e bids subm itted to PG&E f or Tehachapi wind re sources. If the CAISO can estim ate the costs and benefits associ ated with th e network upgrades required to accomm odate the s tate’s larges t renewable re source areas, it m ay reduce the im portan ce of quantifying network benefits and congestion costs. (d) The Draft Energy Report contains other usefu l reco mmen dations. Finally, we support the Draft Report’s recomm endations that the CPUC shoul d require IOUs to procure a prudent contract-risk m argin to avoid under-procu rement of renewable energy (p. 94); that the CPUC shoul d expeditiously com plete com pliance rules for ES Ps and CCAs (p. 90), and that the legislature should adopt consis tent statewide RPS rules for public ly-owned utilities (p. 95). The Commission should identify addi tional actions that it could take to accelerate the RPS process In addition to the recomm endations addre ssed above, there are se veral addition al ways in which the Comm ission can and should advance the RPS goals, which should be reflected in the final report. (a) The Commission should engage the CAI SO in its Intermittency Analysis Project. The Draft Energy Report references (p. 100) the work that the PIER program will be conducting over the next year to better understand and address the im pacts of integrating large amounts of i ntermittent renewable resources in to California’s system . We strongly su pport 8 “Comments of the Califo rnia Wind En ergy Association on Preliminary Scoping Me mo,” CP UC Docket I.05-0 9-005 (Septe mber 30, 20 05). 12

this ef fort. However, we are con cerned that this effort – the Interm ittency Analysis P roject (IAP) – is m issing an important opportunity to engage the CAISO at the highest levels to ensure that it supports the m ethods that will be employed in the IAP effor t. The Draft Report states (at p. 101) that “the CA ISO should undertake a research initiative to address m inimum load issu es, includ ing forecasting future m inimum load problem s, the number of annual even ts, and the dep th of the problem ” – but these issues w ill be s tudied in the IAP ef fort. Rather than encourage the CAISO to duplicate efforts, th e Comm ission should include the CAISO in its efforts to en sure tha t it will be com fortab le with the resu lts and can immediately take further action s from there. (b) The Commis sion s hould produce syst em integration cost information for application to RPS bids. The RPS statu te requ ires tha t the u tilities consid er the sy stem integ ration costs and cap acity v alues associated with renewable resource bids. To date, the CPUC has r elied upon infor mation from the CEC’s “California RPS Integration Cost Analysis – Phase I” study, which was an analysis of th e costs associated with existing renewable resources on the system . The decis ions that the C PUC must m ake on transm ission expansions, as well as ap provals of utility-s elected com petitiv e bids, will r equire integ ration co st information rela ted to signif icant ad dition al qua ntities of renewable re sources. As f ar as we can determ ine, the Comm ission has no effort underway to produce this infor mation, which is needed to advance the state’s RPS goals. We strongly encourage the Commission to ensure that this inform ation is produced either as part of the IAP, or from a separate effort. This need should be reflected in the final Energy Report. (c) The Commis sion s hould ensure that WREGIS tracks energy deliveries. The draft report states (p. 97) that California should move toward full REC trading in the state and western region once WREGIS is in p lace and operational, and should, among other things, “assure energy is actually delivered. ” The Co mmission has not, however, taken steps to ensure that W REGIS will ac tually have th e capability to track ene rgy delive ries,9 even though the New England tracking system has dem onstrat ed that su ch tracki ng is possible. The Comm ission should immediately take steps to ens ure that W REGIS will have this function. If California is to rea lize benefits from out-of-state generation, we m ust be sure that the power is delivered to the state. (d) The Commis sion s hould develop gu idelin es for issuin g SEP payments. The Comm ission has not yet develope d rules for how it will apply supplem ental energy paym ents (SEPs) to winning RPS bids that require them . Though we do not anticipate a great dem and for SEP paym ents any tim e soon, the Comm ission can ensure that there w ill be no delays should SEPs be required. One of the more difficu lt issues to be resolved is how SEPs on a 20- year con tract will b e converted to a 1 0-year p ayment stream . D. The Draft Report’s Criticisms of FERC o n its Tehachapi Trunk Line Decision are Misguided 9 A Commission staff person inf ormed us that the RFP soliciting bids to devel op the WRE GIS electronic tra cking s ystem is limited to tracking renewable attributes (i.e., RECs) and not energ y. 13

The Draft Energy Report (at pp. E-8, 85, a nd 90) unfairly critic izes the FE RC for having “removed the prim ary instrum ent the stat e could have used to address transm ission constraints for renewables” and for “effec tively bar[ring] the advanced planning and construction of transm ission facilities.” First, the FE RC was obligated to d eny Sout hern California E dison’s proposal for a new catego ry of transm ission facility (called a “renewable-resou rce trunk line”) because SCE characterized it as being devoid of network bene fits. For FERC to have charged the cost of such an upgrade to transm ission custom ers as requested would have violated a long-standing and basic principal of the Federal Power Act: transm ission custom ers cannot be required to pay for something that they do not benefit from . Second, FERC deserves significant credit for using its legal f lexibility to grant SCE’s request to enable it to build transm ission f acilities in advance o f generator interconnection requests without incurring penalt ies should the f acilities be abandoned or cancelled. FERC had no oblig ation to do this; it reached far be yond what it had ever done before, and should be commended for it. In so doing, FERC did in fact enable advance planning and construction of transm ission facilities by transm ission owners. These issues are exp lained in detail in a memo analyzing the F ERC decision by CalWEA’s transm ission counsel, Scott Hem pling, which we attach here as Appendix 2. E. The Commission Should Focus on the Tools Available to the State to Achieve California’s R PS Transmission Goals Rather than unfairly criticizing FER C, the final Energy Report should focus on the other recomm endations that the Draft Report m akes related to this issue -- m odifying the CAISO tariff to consider state policy goals (p. 86), and encouraging com prehensive transm ission planning efforts by the Co mmission, the CPUC and the CAISO. The final Energy Report should also expand its focus to two additiona l issues: the need for the CPUC to use its statutory authority under PU Code Se ction 399.25 to (a) promote transm ission upgrades that provide network bene fits while tapping the state’s m ajor renewable resource areas (with co sts therefore recovera ble from all transm ission custom ers), and (b) ensure that those upgrades are fina nced by the transm ission owner. This statutory provision of th e RPS legislation recognizes th e discretion inherent in the FERC’s criteria for “n etwork” st atus, providing the CPUC with th e ability to put before FERC argum ents that a facility should be designated “network” when that facility has both network and non-network characteristics. Had the CPUC m ade be tter us e of this code section, it could have found that SCE’s “trunk line” (Segm ent 3 of the Antelope project) has network characteris tics as well as gen-tie characteristics10 or, had the Comm ission not found such be nefits, it could have ordered SCE to 10 Evidence of Segment 3’s network bene fits was put forward at FERC by CalWEA. 14

reconfigure the proposed facility so that it provided network benefits. S CE is now studying just such a reconfiguration.11 If taken ef fectively, these step s will resu lt in th e CPUC’s ability to meet California’s RPS goals without the need for m ajor changes in F ERC’s current approach to transm ission cost recovery.12 Respectf ully subm itted, ___________/s/____________ Nancy Rader Executive Director California Wind Energy Association 1198 Keith Avenue Berkeley, C A 94708 (510) 845-5077 nrader@calwea.org October 10, 2005 11 SCE’s Gary Schoon yan stated at the Septem ber 12, 2005, E nergy Action Plan meeting that SCE is studying a connection bet ween Seg ment 3 and t he Midway substat ion, which, he said, would provide the network benefits that FERC requires if transm ission custom ers are to be charged for the fa cilities.

APPENDIX 1 Comments of the Califor nia Wind Energy Ass ociation on CEC Staff Response to P ublic Comments on the st aff report titled Assessment of Avi an Mortali ty from Collisions and Electrocutions written i n support of the 2005 E nvironmental Per forma nce Rep ort and the 2005 Int egrated Energy P olicy Report (Staff Resp onse dated August 3 1, 2005 and poste d September 14, 2005) October 1 0, 2005 While we app reciate the st aff’s efforts to resp ond to the wind ind ustry’s c omments, staff’s re sponse can be character ized a s an attempt t o obfu scate t he issue s to which they purport to re spond, even resort ing to an ad homine m attack.1 While volu minous, the Staff Respon se do es not add ress CalWE A’s thr ee maj or areas of concern : The 20 04 PIE R study, whic h forms the basis for staff policy reco mmendat ions, sensationaliz ed wind-facil ity-related avian mo rtality at the Altamont. The study was not designed to a ccurately cal culate fa cility-related avian mortality. Such a study would need to control for background avian mort ality, use consistent search areas, empl oy more frequent search inter vals, and re move any car casses found so as not to dou ble- (or even triple-) count scavenged and moved c arcasses. These issue s are d iscussed in detail below. T he underlying data used t o identify "problem turbine s" suffers from the sa me absence of controls f or incon sistent search frequencies and search areas, in consistent stu dy duration s, the likelihood of carcass double- (or tripl e-) counting, and potential ly even background mortal ity.2 1 Rather than adequately addre ss her specif ic, docu mented cr iticisms, the Sta ff Resp onse questions (p. 6) the creden tials of one of the author s of our r emarks, Dr. Carol Weisskopf. Staff f ails to menti on that Weissk opf h as been con ducting inte rdisciplin ary stud ies with wildl ife biologists since 1985, incl uding publi shed works. 2 At the Octo ber 6 I EPR hearing, pr oponents of this st udy asse rted that (even if the mort ality estimate s are wrong), the mort ality associatio ns with particul ar turbines ( on which the proposed mitigation measures are b ased) are co rrect because the y were based on actual carcasses found, not esti mates. We dis agree. Th e mortality a ssociations suffer fro m many of the same flaws as the mortality estimates. Carcass coun ts were used to compare the relative ha zard of a variety of factors (e.g., turbine type, landscape features, tower type, etc.). The accu racy of this comp arison is compromi sed by the variability in numbers of s earches, intervals betwee n searches, num ber of years searches too k place and the ce rtainty that a mortality was att ributabl e to a particula r turbine. Fo r instan ce, search interval s varied from 13 to 139 days, and mo re carca sses would be found at turbi ne or lan dscape feature s searche d at more fre quent intervals. It is likely that many feature s ident ified as mo re hazard ous are an artifact o f these variati ons. The stud y authors acknowled ge that adjust ments were m ade to co rrect for the di fference in se arch eff ort, but it does n ot appear to us that the adjustments were made accu rately enough to ju stify re moving or relocat ing turbines. (Th e level of accuracy of the adjust ments i s a quest ion that we would like the inde pendent review to answer.) One thing is clear: when a large d ata set is bein g used to determine relatively small difference s in the statist ics, it is impe rative to minimize the va riability in the things over w hich the resear cher has c ontrol -- in this cas e, most importantly the search inte rvals, search diameter and the seasonal issue. As we have shown, there were large varian ces in each of these are as. CalWEA Appendix 1 - Pag e 1

Staff i gnores the differ ence between the tu rbine m odels oper ating in the Alta mont and those use d elsewhere. Ne w wind parks are not constructed with obsolete turbines. A theoretical siting model, based on tiny turbin es and faulty data, cannot, therefore, form the basis for eith er Alta mont-s pecific or st atewide s iting guideline s or require ments. Staff’s re commendat ion th at statew ide guideline s should be ado pted to guide the siting, oper ation and monitoring of new wind develo pments is a solution in sea rch of a proble m. There is n o indication that C EC staff or consultants have studied local sitin g processes in Calif ornia, le t alone pro vided eviden ce that they are not workin g. Wind fac ility- related av ian mort ality in the Altam ont is unique an d isolated. And yet, staff has used the Altamont pr oblem a s a backdro p for recommen dations for statew ide av ian gu idelines and t he develop ment of m itigation measures outside of the Altamont. Staff ha s not st udied s iting processes outside of the Al tamont, let alone supported state ments such a s “developing mitigation measure s for implementati on would allo w for continu ed use of the wind resources in Solano Count y,”3 which erroneou sly implies that cont inued use of the wind resource in Solan o is not presently possible, an d overl ooks the fact that S olano C ounty is alre ady imposing m itigation measures for avian impacts. The staf f finds “puzzling ” a request tha t its recommenda tion for statewide guideli nes should benefit by a full and adequate review by the pu blic before becoming Co mmission policy (PDF- page 1 1) despite the fa ct that staf f did not indi cate, in docu ment s feed ing int o the I EPR, which set of e xisting guidelin es ought to be a dopted f or statewide us e, how they sho uld be applie d, or whether st aff mean s to sugge st that an entire ly new set of gu idelines sh ould be develop ed.4 Moreo ver, the only justifi cation staff offer f or such guideline s is that “Current ly, siting win d development s at the local level is in consist ent.” (PDF-page 11.) Inconsisten cy, however, is perfectly ap propriate a s it merely refle cts completely different local circumstan ces requ iring different siting policie s. Discussi on of Item 1: The 2004 st udy was not designed t o accurately calculate facility- related avian mortality There are several indicat ions in the Staff Resp onse that the 2004 P IER study by Smallwood and Thelander was not designe d to estimate Altamo nt Pass wind- facility-related avian mortality.5 Yet, staff d oes not dir ectly acknowledg e this fa iling or propose to retract the e stimate s that the study gratuitously produced. The estimates are exaggerated and have bee n widely quoted in the medi a. We would like to state on ce ag ain that we do not deny that wind facility-related avian fatalities in the Altam ont Pass are o f great con cern. Inflam mato ry estim ates of those fat alities, however, do nothing to solve the proble m. 3 California E nergy Commis sion Staf f Report, “ 2005 Environment al Perfor mance Report o f Californ ia’s E lectrical Syst em” at p. 16 (CEC-700-2005-016). June 2005. 4 In the Staff Respon se at PDF-page 149, it does f inally becom e clear that sta ff intends to develop a wholly new set of gu ideline s, duplicat ing years of effort by the NWCC and the CEC’s own sta ff. 5 See, e.g., Staff Re sponse PDF-page 1 10, wherein a memo from Linda Spie gel and Shawn Smallwood st ates, “we bel ieve it is inappropriat e to conve rt our fatality dat a to mortality estimate s … We disagree with your stated in tention to convert these data t o mort ality estimate s at the turbine string or individual turbine l evel, includin g turbines wh ere fatal ity searches wer e perfo rmed less than one year.” CalWEA Appendix 1 - Pag e 2

The next two subse ctions expla in the inadeq uacy of the staff re sponses to C alWEA’s documented errors on gol den eagle mortality estimates and the use of e xcessive corre ction factors as exemplified by the cowbird mortality estimate; the third sub section explain s why, contr ary to st aff’s explan ation, ba ckground mort ality should have been as sessed at the Altamont. a. Golde n eagle example The mo st basic of exaggerations is foun d in th e 2004 PIER study’s estimate s of golden eagle mortality. In an attach ment to this app endix, Wei sskopf e xplains why the Staff Respon se fails to answe r our charge that the study inflated the number of gold en eagle deat hs at the Altamont by a factor of three. In summ ary, Weis skopf had shown a s ignificant di screpancy betw een two sets of dat a used in the 2004 stud y, one of which cau sed th e overall golden eagle mortality rate to greatly excee d that produ ced by all previous studies w e have seen, includin g an NREL rep ort by the same author s now i n press . The 2004 study explain s that t he high er mortality rate s in that report as compared to an NREL report by the same authors that used some of the same data is due to a particular set of turbine s that the authors cla im subst antially ex ceeds the m ortality ove r most of the rest of the pass. Bu t Weissk opf showed th at this set of turbines is not within the data set that produced the high er mortality rate , and therefore cannot explain the higher rate. Instead of attemptin g to determin e the source of th e discrepan cy between the two sets of data—which r esulted in the fact or-of-three erro r—the Staff Resp onse in stead accu ses Weis skopf of tran sposing figu res in h er calcul ations. Bu t in the attached re sponse, Weisskopf explain s that, first, th ere was no such transposition an d, more importantly, the suppose dly transpose d figure s are irrelevant because they should have been excluded from the calcul ation. Moreo ver, sta ff continues t o state that mortality estimate s were d erived from fatalit ies caused by collision with moving bl ades, and tha t carcasses “show injurie s specific to th is source suc h as severed b ody parts and torsos cut in half” (Staff R esponse, PDF-page 3). Staff goes on to stress that “ fatalit ies that could not be attribut ed to turbine blade collision wer e omitted fr om the analysi s” (Staff Resp onse, PDF-page 3). This claim is astonishing given that, of the Set 2 turbine ca rcasses used t o develop Altamont mortality estim ates (staff p rotestations aside, the Set 1 data has not yet bee n made available to us ), 43% were classified as feath ers, 3% a s old rema ins, 18% as complete carcasses, 2% as dec apitated, 1% as d ismembered and 12% as wings. In the field comments, 48% descr ibed t he carc ass as having unkn own injuries becau se the carcass wa s missing, 4% s tated si mply unknown injuries, 4% descr ibed the ca rcass as ha ving unknown injuries due t o scavenging, an d 9% were described as having unk nown injuries because part or most of the ca rcass was missing (e.g., “Unknown injuries. Only tail fea thers foun d.” “Unknown inj uries. Only leg bones and few feat hers present.” “Unknown injuries. Part of carcass missing and decayed.” “Unknown injuries. Only partial left wing, bon es and feathers.”). The nature of the injury was listed for only 47 of 131 carcasses. Of these, 6 (13%) were listed as havin g no inj ury apparent. Only 41 (31% ) had in juries that could b e considere d eviden ce of wind fa cility- related m ortality. b. Cowbir d example When CalWEA reviewed t he 2004 PIER report, we questioned how 919 carcasses found during 4+ years o f a stu dy could lead to spec ies-specific mortality estim ates that added u p to mo re than 10,900 birds per year. We docu mented cowb irds as an exam ple of how the fou nd car casses CalWEA Appendix 1 - Pag e 3

--- Page 18 ---
were extra polated into overall mo rtalit y estim ates.6 The cowb ird was sele cted becau se the report pre sented a turbine mort ality fa ctor for cowbirds in the Set 2 data, pr oviding a s imple example as there was onl y one carcass in the Set 2 data, and the Set 2 data w ere the only data to which CalWEA was provided ac cess. The absurdit ies of the distance of the carcass to th e nearest turb ine, the error in the turbin e power rating and the magnitude of the final mort ality estimate were product s of the selection , not the reason for it. Staff’s focus on these i ssues distracts from the ir failure to con vincingly add ress the ma in point of the examp le: that an exce ssive number of overly large correction fa ctors was used f or the Set 2 turbine s. The 20 04 PIER report was f orced to employ an e xcessively large scavenger correction factor be cause the se arch in tervals ( i.e., number of days between searches) for the Set 2 turbine s were three month s, as compared t o the two- to four-week intervals that are standard practice in mode rn avian mort ality stud ies. Shorter se arch interval s avoid the need to use large scavenger corre ction factors. The NWCC Guideline s do not include r ecommended study intervals, but do recommend (on p. 22) th at study method s be selected t o minimize bi as in the outcome of the study, and that bias can be t olerated only if it is relatively small, measurable, or consistent among study areas , which are not ch aracteristics of the Set 2 data extrap olations. Regard ing some of the pa rticula rs: • CalWEA continues to believe a carcass found 430 fe et from the nearest turbine should not have been used in mortality calcul ations, and that doublin g the mort ality estimate is particul arly unjustified given the dist ance betwee n the carcass and the turbine. • The Staff Re sponse (PDF-p age 1 60) states, “The mortality esti mates for bird species, includin g the brown-head ed cowb ird, were mad e only for bird species with more than one turbine-caused fatalit y.” This state ment is at odds with the 2004 PIER report (p. 70), which p rovides a Set 2 turbine mortality fa ctor for the s ingle cowbi rd found in that set. • The Staff Re sponse adds ( PDF-page 162), “It is not true that only one turbine s tring included a br own-headed cowb ird, and it is not true that Smallwood and Thel ander (2004) m istakenly identifi ed a 65-kW tur bine as a 150-kW turbine model. ” The CalWEA cowb ird document nowhere states that only one string included a brown-headed cowb ird, alth ough the dat a and the 2004 re port both indicate that only one cowbird carcass was found in the Set 2 turbines. The error in turbine MW value was al so identif ied independently in ”Reply Co mments of Cal ifornia Wind C ompanies on the Committee W orkshop of Ju ne 27-28, 2005” (p. 59). In closin g comment s, the Staff Res ponse (PDF-page 167) state s, “Reportin g the range o f estimate s as well as the a ctual number of fat alities gives the reviewer all the facts. We isskopf could have made her argument usin g the lower range rather than the higher range, and not doing so was mislead ing.” Although this statemen t is not relevant to the docu mentation of the cowb ird fatality extrap olations, we agree with the comment. On the other han d, CalWEA’s focus on the high-end m ortality esti mate is consistent with widesp read rep orting of the high- end mort ality estim ates of all birds an d raptor death s in the 2004 PIER report, which are repeated in C EC staf f documents, pre sentation s to planning commissioners, lit igant fil ings and media report s. The general public does not he ar, for ex ample, abo ut the 3 63 raptor c arcasses found during more than four years of st udy; rather, they hear about the estimated 880 to 1,300 annu al raptor deaths in the Altamont. 6 For exampl e (looking at set 2 carcasses only), the cowbird turn ed into 300 cowbirds, each burr owing owl turned into 6 0, and each bla ckbird turned i nto 12 0.

c. B ackgroun d mortal ity Among the ju stifications for omitting assessment of backgr ound a vian m ortality, CEC staff r efer (p. 162) to other studie s, e.g., one at B uffalo Ridge in Minnesota, that dis count backgr ound mortality. B ut circu mstances at other area s do no t justify the same pract ice at the Altamont. There are a n umber of differences, for example, between the avi an situat ion at Buffalo Rid ge and the Altamont. Buffalo Ridge carcass counts were low a t both refere nce and turbi ne sites, an d there were no avian concerns at Buffal o Ridge even w ithout adjustment for background mortality. There was no need fo r discussions o f turbine di smantlin g or relocat ions, operational curt ailment, contr ibutions to mit igation funds or law suits. Sin ce these opt ions are under di scussion in the Altamont, a c loser investigation of the Buffalo Ridge data i s warr anted. Of the 5, 322 fatality sear ches at Bu ffalo Ridge, 46.6% took plac e at referen ce sites and 5 3.4% at turbine s ites.7 On refe rence site s, 31 carcasses were found (0. 0125 carcasses/search) and 55 carcasses (0.0194 carcasses/search) w ere found at turbine s ites. The three phase s of the Buffalo R idge project had different mortality estimat es, with phase 1 having an annual mortality of 0.98 bird s per turbine, phase 2 h aving 2.27 bird s per turbine, an d phase 3 w ith 45 bird s per turbine. Th e reference site avian m ortality esti mate was 1. 10 deaths per turbine-equivalent site per year, higher than that for the phase 1 t urbines. Adjusting f or backg round r ates would h ave completely eliminate d turbine-relat ed avian mortality for the phase 1 turbines, reduced by half the mortality estimate for the phase 2 turbin es, and reduced by one quart er the mort ality estimate for the phase 3 turbine s. Because they were so low, Buffalo Rid ge mort ality estimates, unadjusted or n ot, were of lit tle consequence, so elimin ating the cost for referenc e site searches w as an ea sy de cision to m ake. If carcasses were found a t reference sites in the Altamont equivalent to half or one quarter of the numbers found at turbine sites, the consequenc es would be n o longer trivial, and the cost fully justified. Unlike the Buffalo R idge case, however, the 2004 PIER study ne ver investigat ed background mort ality. [Please see separate Attach ment to this appendix.] 7 Johnson G.D ., W.P.

APPENDIX 2 MEMORANDUM TO: Nancy Rader, CalW EA FROM: Scott Hem pling, Law Offices of Scott Hem pling, P.C. DAT E: July 11, 2005 RE: Thoughts on FERC’s Antelope Decision This m emorandum discussed the FE RC's deci sion on SCE' s request for favorable rate treatment of the Antelop e Projec t upgrades.1 Part I provides an overview of the FERC decision. Part II contains m y comm ents on the decision. Part III contains m y comments on the concur rence of Comm issioner Brownell. Part IV offers suggestions for next steps. An Appendix contains descriptions of the th ree u pgrade segm ents at issu e. 1) Overview of Decision In this case, SCE asked FERC to "roll in " to its tr ansm ission rates the cos t of the Antelope Project.2 The Antelope Project consists of three up grades to SC E's transm ission system . SCE labels these upgrades S egment 1, Segm ent 2 and Segm ent 3.3 In addition to roll-in, SC E sought, for all th ree segm ents, FERC' s comm itments for full recovery of prudently-incurred costs, regardless of whether pot ential wind generation develops or SCE abandons or cancels one or m ore of the segm ents. SCE sought this comm itment because FERC has a preceden t requiring a utility to bea r half the prude nt cost of a projec t where the project is abandoned or canceled du e to lack of dem and. The intent of this policy is to assure that u tilities m anage their busines s risks carefully rather than view the ratepayer as the guarantor of all cost recovery. 1 Southern California Edison Company , "Order on Petition for Declaratory Order," Docket No. EL05-80- 000, 112 FERC p ara. 61,014 (July 1, 2005). 2 ARoll-in @ is the ter m of art used to describe the inclus ion of particular costs in the cost of service used to set a utilit y's rates. In the conte xt of u pgrade s caused by interconnec ting generators, the opposite of "roll-in" is "direct assignment." Direct assign ment means the int erconnecting generator pays for the upgrade; "roll -in" m eans that all transm ission user s (including the i nterconnecting generator o r its custo mer) pa y for the upgrade. 3 These three seg ments are described in the Appendix to this m emorandum .

CalWEA Appendix 2 – p. 2 a) Segments 1 and 2 FERC approved roll-in because the upgrades ar e integrated with, and operate in parallel with, the transmission network. FERC stated (par a. 36, citing SCE's affidavit submitted by Jorge Chacon): "36. Segments 1 and 2 are upgrades to existing, high-voltage, network transmission facilities or upgrades that will operate in parallel with existing high-voltage, network transmission facilities and these two segments will be transmission facilities that can be full y integrated with the CAISO-Controlled Grid when constructed and placed under CAISO Operational Control." "37. Segment 1 includes a new 25.6 mile 500 kV transmission line between the existing Antelope and Pardee substations , single and double circuit towers that will be energized initially at 220 kV, and an expansion of the Antelope substation to accommodate the new 500 kV rating. Segment 2 includes a new 17.8 mile 500 kV transmission line between the existing Antelope and Vincent substations and upgrades such as transformers, circuit breakers, and disconnect switches necessary at both substations to terminate the new transmission line. These two segments are not radial in nature, and will be part of the looped transmission system where the energy would flow from their substations (from Antelope to Pardee substations for Segment 1 and from Antelope to Vincent substations for Segment 2), but can be reversed depe nding on the season and the generation on line. These new facilities will be integr ated with the existing Big Creek 220 kV corridor and the available capacity of these facilities will be used for multiple purposes, e.g., serve load and increase tr ansfer capacity for existing generation facilities." "38. According to SCE, Segments 1 and 2 will provide additional benefits to the transmission grid; for example, they will increase the transfer capability, eliminate or mitigate thermal and transient stabili ty problems under certain conditions, and can be relied upon for CAISO scheduling purposes. No other party disputes this assertion. In addition, the CAISO will be ab le to provide servic e to Participating Transmission Owners as well as other transmission customers over the two segments. Segments 1 and 2 will provide cap ability and reliability benefits to the transmission grid and could be relied on for coordinated operation of the grid. Therefore, we find that Segments 1 a nd 2 are network upgrades, the costs of which are discussed further below, a nd may be recovered through SCE's TRR." FERC promised that there will not be a prude nce disallowance if th ere is cancellation or abandonment should sufficient wind generation not appear. Para. 58 ("We will, however, grant SCE's request and allow it to r ecover 100 percent of th e prudent cost (as discussed above) of Segments 1 and 2 even if these faci lities are abandoned or cancelled.").

--- Page 22 ---
CalWEA Appendix 2 – p. 3 FERC deferred ruling on whether the size of Segments 1 and 2 is prudent; SCE can re-ask for this ruling after it obtains a certificate of conve nience and necessity from the California PUC. See para. 57: "... The CPUC has not completed its revi ew for the certific ate(s) of public convenience and necessity. Nor has the CA ISO, as regional system operator, weighed in on all aspects of this project . Accordingly, we will defer on the issue of advance prudence with regard to the appropriate sizing of Segments 1 and 2 until after the CPUC has granted SCE th e necessary certificate(s) of public convenience and necessity" (also noting, in n.43, that "SCE is not seeking an advance prudence call on the actual cost of the Antelope Project").” b) Segment 3 FERC denied all of SCE =s requests because the f acility is a gen-tie which does not benefit the network. FERC expressly relied on SCE's own statements: Given the information provided by SCE, we find that Segment 3 is not a network upgrade and therefore, not eligible for rolled -in rate treatment. Further, as noted by various intervenors, these appear to be generation-tie facilities, and our precedent has been that it would be improper to shift the costs of such facilities from the interconnection customers to al l users of the transmission grid. In addition, SCE has neither shown that all us ers of the CAISO-Controlled grid will receive the benefits of these facilities nor how Segment 3 will provide benefits to the grid. We also do not have a determination from CAISO on whether these facilities should be transferre d to its Operational Control." Para. 42 (emphasis added). The "informati on provided by SCE" included (as summarized by FERC): [para. 22] "SCE characterizes Segment 3 as a generation-tie line, the cost of which is ordinarily paid by interconnecting generators. However, it contends that such a policy is a barrier to entry for wi nd resources located in remote areas for several reasons: (1) the large capital outlays are not feasible and add unacceptable financial risk; (2) incremental transmission upgrades based on first-in-queue is ineffective for loca tions where renewable resources tend to locate; and (3) clustering of interconnection applications to have jointly-owned or jointly-funded transmission upgrades is unlikely." [para. 24] "SCE says that the lines an d substations are high voltage (initially operated at 220 kV, with an actual rating of 500 kV), will reach approximately 35 miles from the last point on the existing 220 kV grid to the second new substation, and will extend the grid to a large concen tration of potential renewable resources from the Tehachapi region that the CPUC has found necessary to meet the state's renewable procurement objectives."

--- Page 23 ---
CalWEA Appendix 2 – p. 4 [para. 40] ... "[T]o take advantage of economies of scale, SCE has designed the Segment 3 facilities to serve the multip le interconnection customers that may develop generation projects in the Te hachapi area. And, although Segment 3 facilities are high voltage facilities, they do not operate in parallel with existing transmission facilities." FERC then added, at n.33: "We note that SCE has stated that if th e Commission does not allow recovery of the cost of the Antelope Project in general transmission rates, the CPUC is to allow SCE to recover the reasonable transmission costs in retail rates. Cal.Pub.Util.Code sec. 399.25(b)(2)."23 2) Comments on the Decision a) Segments 1 and 2 FERC promised not to penalize SCE by disall owing costs in case of abandonment or cancellation. FERC here used its legal flexibility to help wind without committing legal error. FERC could have said "let's wait until cancellation or abandonment occurs and then see what the facts were." FERC had no obliga tion to grant SCE's request. FE RC precedent in fact requires the utility to absorb half th e cost of abandonment or cancellation. But FERC interpreted this precedent flexibly. The reason why FERC has hist orically held a utility 50% accountable for abandonment or cancellation is that these decisions are within th e utility's control, and FERC wants utilities to exercise contro l carefully, sharing risks with its customers. Here, SCE correctly argued, and the FERC correctly agre ed, that the reasons for can cellation or abandonment would be outside the utility's control. The reasons would include generators not appearing in sufficient number, or appearing an d then disappearing. 23 This footnote is odd (separate from mis-citing the relevant provision, which is §399.25(b)(4 )). It has no legal relevance. Whether the Federal Power Act allows recovery from transmission ratepayers is legally unaffected by state law. Under the FPA, tr ansmission ratepayers pay for an upgrade if they receive benefits from it upgrade. FERC found there are no transmission ratepayer benefits from the upgrade; therefore they cannot be forced to pay for it. State law has nothing to do with it.

--- Page 24 ---
Since the events leading to a decision to abandon or cancel would be outside the utility' s control, FERC granted SCE's reques t to be insulated f rom the tra ditional 50% cost dis allowance. Contrast FE RC's reasoning with inte rest group argum ents m ade by som e intervenors. Had FERC said "we' re granti ng SCE' s request because we want to help renewable s," FERC would have co mmitted leg al error. Ou tside of PURPA, FERC has no legal authority to single out a form of electric generation for special treatm ent.24 Instead FERC stuck with its n on-renewables preceden t but used a leg itimate open ing. The size of the facility gave FERC pause. See para. 57. FERC cannot award a blank check. The FPA does not allow FERC to make transm ission ratepayers pay f or a facility of any size, just b ecause the state of California or ders that size. FERC has an independent obligation to assure that transm ission ratepayers are not paying for m ore facility than they need. It is one thin g to say that an upgrad e stim ulated by an interconnecting generato r will in crease reliab ility and theref ore benefit all transm ission users; it' s another thing to m ake transm ission custom ers pay for m ore capacity than is needed by th e full load. FERC therefore wit hheld full approval until the P UC issues a certificate of public convenien ce and necessity. P ara. 57. This statem ent does not m ean that FERC will nec essarily approve all co sts just because the PUC has granted th e certificate; it means that FE RC wants to see a full record supporting the size before acting. CalWEA shoul d theref ore consider participating in the CPCN pr oceeding to ensure that this record is provided. b) Segment 3 On Segm ent 3, SCE left FERC unable to show flexibility. To the extent FERC looked only at S CE's subm ission and forgot about CalW EA's, FERC' s decision was correct, and easily predictable. There is no budging on the principle that transm ission rates can reflect only those investm ents that benefit the transm ission ratep ayer. Once SCE characte rized Segm ent 3 as perform ing only a gen-tie function, as a non-network facility not integr ated with the grid, there was no way for FERC to avoid denying the requ est for roll-in. For the m any opponents o f SCE' s filing, SCE' s subm ission m ade defeating us on Segm ent 3 a sim ple matter of quoting SCE. It then took F ERC exactly one paragraph to explain itself. 24 It is true that FERC is try ing to m ake transm ission costs more reasonable for interm ittent power: but FE RC's legal technique f or doing so -- t he right technique -- is not "we like renewables" but "we are not goi ng to allow transmission owners to im pose penalties on intermittency which are excessive in relat ion to the effects of inter mittency . In other words, FERC continues to focus on assigning c osts fa irly. The benefit to wind from FERC's interm ittency decisions is that FERC stepped in rather than leave the matter to transm ission providers who were less committed to resolving the problem . CalWEA Appendix 2 – p. 5

--- Page 25 ---
FERC cannot lawf ully a ssign to tran smission custom ers any costs which do not produce benefits for those costs. This princi ple is not arguable or negotiable. FERC' s powers are lim ited by statute. T ransm ission ra tes m ust be just and reasonable. Courts have found that rates are not just and reasonable if they include costs which are not associated w ith benefits to the ratepayer. When we talk of benef its to the ratep ayer, we ar e talk ing abou t the ratep ayer buying the service at issue -- here, transm ission service. It m akes no difference to the transm ission ratepayer -- in hi s role as transm ission ratep ayer -- tha t the state is attrac ting more generation or increasing the diversity of that genera tion. These concerns are not Federal Pow er Act concerns. There is no lawful way to create a Athird category, @ as SCE sought to do. Under the Federal Power Act, there are only two catego ries of facility: the f acility eithe r benefits the network or it does not. The unm ovable principle is that you cannot make transm ission ratepayers pay for som ething unle ss it gives them benef its. Yes, there can be m ultiple ways to sho w network benef its. But there m ust be network b enefits: otherwise, no roll-in. To say Athere are no network benefits bu t there are plenty of oth er reasons to charge transm ission ratepayers @ is asking FERC to do the legally im possible. The only way for a roll-in argum ent to have survived SCE' s subm ission was for FERC to disregard it, in favor of an alte rnative subm ission. T hat was the purpose of CalW EA's subm ission o f Whit Russell' s affidavit, explaining the network benefits of Segm ent 3. 3) Comments on the Concurren ce of Commiss ioner Brownell Comm. Brownell' s concurrence asserts that the proposal would have greater chance of success if the proposal com es from the CA ISO, using Order 2003' s "independent entity" variation. If the CA ISO takes this route, the CA ISO should explain that Segm ent 3 will prov ide network be nefits of the type typic ally requir ed by FERC as a prerequ isite for roll-in. Otherwise, we are likely to see a repeat of FERC’s initial rejection. The m ajority rejected S CE's subm ittal not because SCE is a non-independent transm ission provider, b ut becaus e the subm ittal disclaim ed any network benefits. T he majority' s brief explanation of its rejec tion said nothing about independent vs. non- independent status. Comm. Brownell' s concurrence does not a ddress the network benefits problem . The concurrence states that these facilitie s were not envisioned by Order 2003, in that they are siz ed in advance to accommodate m ultiple gene rators. It des cribes this type of a facility as a "m ultiple-us e on-ram p to th e CAISO Grid, rath er than as so le-use interconnection facilities." This description does not rescue the facility from the m ajority opinion, which rejects ro ll-in becau se the benefi ts of the line are not network benefits. CalWEA Appendix 2 – p. 6

--- Page 26 ---
That m ore than one generator uses the lin e, and that the advance construction and financing of the line is "beyond the means of any one developer," does not respond to the majority' s view (which itself is supported by decades of FERC a nd court opinions) that roll-in requires benefits to the transm ission network, not to the interconnecting generators. Recognizing the necessity of network benefits, the concurrence m akes this attem pt to sa ve Segm ent 3: "Segm ent 3 facilities would provide be nefits to a ll use rs of the CAISO Grid by cre ating th e pote ntial to in terconnect significant new and diverse supplies of energy. Therefore, I beli eve that this proposal would have satisfied the independent entity vari ation standard in Order No. 2003, had it been m ade by the CAISO...." This passage has two problem s. First, it does not distinguish this facility from any non- integrated gen-tie. Any gen-tie interconnect s new generation; but an interconnection role alone does not create network benefits. For ne twork benef its to exis t, the transm ission ratepayer m ust benefit in his role as a tran smission custom er, not in his role as a pow er custom er. Second, the next sentence does not follo w from the first. The second sentence implies that the in tercon nection of new ge neration som ehow inter acts with independent entity status to support roll-i n. But as discussed above, the ability to roll-in depends on network benefits; roll-in has nothing to do w ith independent status. FERC created the independen t entity variation option b ecause independent en tities h ave no incentive to discrim inate. See Order 2003 at para. 822 (" RTO or ISO should be treated differently because an independent RTO or ISO does not raise the sam e level of con cern regard ing undue discrim ination."). The di scrimination of concern to FE RC was discrim ination by a generation-owning transm ission provider agains t independent generators. Here, SCE is seeking to have its own ratepayers bear cost s that generators m ight otherwise provide. SCE' s proposal does not involve discrim ination against generators. The independent entity standard has nothing to do with this matter (as evid enced by the ab sence of any mention of t he issue in the m ajority' s decision). Conclusion: Since the independent-nonindependent di stinction had no effect on the m ajority' s decision (n or should it have, because roll-in d epends on network benefits, not on who contro ls the line ), it is ne cessary for the CA ISO, if it does m ake the r efiling, to adjus t the Segm ent 3 plan so th at ne twork benefits are clear. Moreover, the "independent entity vari ation" is not available to shift non-network costs from generators to transm ission custom ers. The requirem ent that transm ission custom ers bear cos ts only to the extent those costs bene fit the n etwork is ro oted in the F PA's "just and reasonable" requirem ent. The flexibility g ranted by Order 2003 to independent entities cannot v iolate that standard. CalWEA Appendix 2 – p. 7

IV. Possible Next Steps on Segment 3 There are th ree poss ible ways to pay fo r Segm ent 3: transm ission ratepayers, retail ratepayers, and in terconnecting generators. a) Transmission ratepayers Allocating S egment 3 costs to transm ission ratepayers requires a FERC de cision. FERC can m ake this decision only if it finds benefits to transm ission ratepayers. FE RC will m ake that f inding on ly if it views Segm ent 3 as integra ted with the tra nsmission network. Having read only SCE' s position on this point, FE RC adopted SCE' s view that Segm ent 3 is non-network. CalWEA' s submission possibly can solve th is problem . Our filing included an affidavit from engineer Whit Ru ssell. The affidavit sought to create a factual basis f or a finding that Segm ent 3 would be integrated with the network. FERC appears to have misplaced CalW EA's filing. Although it listed CalW EA along with the o ther interveno rs, it did no t summarize our position s although it su mmarized th e positions o f others. FERC opinions always summarize the un ique position s of each intervenor. W e should seek rehearing for purposes of havi ng the Comm ission take our affi davit into account. If we do seek rehearing, by statute we m ust do so no later than August 1, 2005. It would be better, however , to have SCE (and its witn ess Jo rge Chacon) (or the CA ISO) adopt som e version of W hit's views. FERC will have difficulty accepting o ur position because it has already gone on r ecord accepting SCE 's position. Our opponents will a rgue in Court tha t FERC changed its m ind ar bitrarily. If it's SCE that m odifies its position, we have a better shot. SCE’s m odification would take the form of a revised application. It could subm it this revised a pplication in two possibl e ways: (a) in the present proceeding, as a petition for rehearing (due 30 days after FERC’s order); or (b) by initiating a n ew proceeding. If SCE chose (a), and if the m odifications were substantial, FERC likely would issue a new public no tice allowing new in terventions and opportunities for comme nts. My recommendation is to try to persua de SCE and Mr. Chacon that they are looking too narrowly at the FERC criteria for network treatment. It is not a black-white situation, i.e., gen-tie v. netw ork. Although there is not clea r preceden t, I think we can fairly argue that a facility can have a gen-tie role but also play an integration role. But we need SCE (or the C A ISO) to agree to h elp, rather than offer arguments which F ERC cannot legally accep t, ever. What we should not do is repeat argum ents that are legally irrelevant. The following argum ents, as paraphrased below by FERC, invite F ERC to reject Segm ent 3 again, us ing language that will b e unhelpful in the future. Thes e argum ents also expose, and em phasize, the ab sence of evidence from SCE that Segment 3 has network benefits. CalWEA Appendix 2 – p. 8

--- Page 28 ---
[para. 23] "... SCE suggests creating a new "narrow and specific category of transm ission facilities," i.e., trunk facilities that would include projects like Segm ent 3. SCE argues that the costs of high-voltage (220 kV or higher) trunk facilities to interconnect and integrat e large concentrations of potential renewable generation resources loca ted in a lim ited geographic area, but a r easonable distance from the existing grid, should be eligible f or rolled-in rate treatm ent. SCE suggests that this new policy should apply where it is consistent w ith a state' s requirem ent to procure energy from renewable resources an d where the state has determ ined, through its state regulatory authority or RTO/ISO, that the upgrades are necessary to meet its policy objectives." [para. 25] "[T]he Segm ent 3 trunk facility will not be unduly discrim inatory becaus e the new category of facilities is n arrowly crafted to further federal and state policies th at encourage the develop ment of renewable energy and to rem ove a roa dblock to the construction of needed transm ission. SCE notes that othe r states hav e enacted renew able portfolio standards m andating goals fo r the purchase of renewable energ y and providing tax incentives and siting assis tance. SCE also claim s that the Comm ission has recently approved exception s to its existing polic ies for interm ittent ren ewable resou rces to "increase diversity in the resource base, [and] thereby im prov[e] system re liability as a whol e." Moreover, it points to the Comm ission' s recently in itiated p roceeding in As sessing the State of W ind Energy in Wholesale Electricity M arkets, Dock et No. AD04-13-000, to assess options to refor m transmission access for interm ittent renewable resources lik e wind. Addition ally, S CE asserts that the Comm ission has previously held th at sim ilar exceptions are not unduly discrim inatory." [para. 26] "SCE understands that th e Comm ission' s polic y is designed to encourage efficient sitin g of generation resources, but renewable energy developers must locate at the site of the resource and do not have the sam e flexibility as other generators about location." We need to discourage our allies from making these argum ents. They have no footing in the Federal Power Act. We also need to discourage the PUC from attacking FERC for "insensitivity to the s tates' needs," or "insensitiv ity to re newable energy" or any similar argum ent that som etimes emanates from state comm issions. FERC has no legal authority -- none -- to m ake transm ission ra tepayers pay for non-network costs in the name of "deference to s tates" o r "sup port fo r renewables." It is possible that those making these argum ents are viewing FERC as a political body that re sponds to interest groups. I cannot m ake the following stat ement more clear: Although FE RC is not politica lly deaf, it is f undamentally a prof ession al oper ation that a ims to cente r its decis ions on legal p rinciples firs t. If we cannot argue network benefits, we will not have supporting legal principles. No am ount of interest pressure or appeals to CalWEA Appendix 2 – p. 9

--- Page 29 ---
renewable s-consciousne ss will f ix that prob lem. Of that f act, the FERC decis ion is a mple evidence. b) Other possibilit ies I am omitting, for purposes of this mem orandum , the followin g other po tential solutions, which require more thought: i) Ask the PUC for a ruling th at the Section 399.25(b)(4) backstop applie s to Se gment 3. Ask the Legislature to modify Section 399.25. Such a m odifi cation could be broad (e.g., all facilities defined as "renewable trunk lines"), or narrow (S egment 3 only). Ownership by a f or-prof it entity o ther than the utility. California taxpayers. Municipal ownership. CalWEA Appendix 2 – p. 10

CalWEA Attachment to Appendix 1 – page 1 Reply to ‘Staff Response to CalWEA August 9, 2005 Letter, Attachment 1: “Significant Calculation Errors Found in the August 2004 PI ER Report”, Carol Pilz Weisskopf, PhD.’ 1 Carol Pilz Weisskopf, Ph.D. Pilz & Co., LLC 656 San Miguel Way, Sacramento, CA 95819 456.7651 Many of the critical public comments in the California Energy Commission (CEC) docket 04-IEP-1G involve matters of study design, selection of appropriate correcti on factors, statistical treatment of data and the level of certitude placed in various mo rtality reduction hypotheses in th e Smallwood and Thelander August 2004 PIER report.2 These are areas subject to difference of opinion and professional judgment, and are open to debate. However, the matter of carcass selection in the calculation of mortality is not debatable – it is a matter of math and of fact, of performing the calculation exactly as described, and the calculation is either correct or incorrect. Our review of golden eagle, red-tailed hawk and grea t horned owl mortality calcul ations relied on two files received from CEC staff on 07 July 2005: ‘C EC data_fatalities. sav’ dated 03/23/05 and ‘CEC data_search dates.xls’ also dated 03/23/05. The pert inent sections of the fatalities file are included in Attachment 2 and those from the search dates in Attachment 3. The first part of the staff response claims ‘Weisskopf sw itched the number of golden eagle carcasses given an Estimated Time since Death of greater than 90 days (15 in Smallwood and Thelander, 6 by Weisskopf’s analysis) with the number categorized as not having ETDs (6 in Smallwood and Thelander, 15 in Weisskopf analysis). 3 First, the Smallwood and Thelander ( 2004) report gives neither the number of Set 2 carcasses with an ETD greater than 90 days nor the number with no ETDs. Thes e must be determined from the data files. Second, in Attachment 2 (an accurate presentation of the data given to us by CEC staff) the carcasses given an ETD greater than 90 days are shown. It is no great trick to count to 6, since one does not even have to take off one’s shoes to do it. Third, neither of these groups of carcasses was to have been used in calculation of the golden eagle mortality factor, since only those with an assigned ETD less than 90 days were to have been used; so the actual carcass number in either category is irrelevant to the calculation. Finally, if CEC staff looked at the data to determine how many carcasses were in each category, either the transposition error is theirs or the data file they gave to us is in error. The sole point of agreement between staff and us is that only 10 golden eagle carcasses were supposed to have been us ed to calculate the Set 2 turbine’s mortality factor. In reference to the actual mortality factor we calculated, CEC staff response to that is ‘It was only a coincidence that Weisskopf’s calculat ion using the wrong group of golden eagle carcasses nearly equaled the unadjusted estimate of Smallwood and Thelander ( 2004); however we cannot de termine from her comment how she did this.’ 4 The staff then goes on to give a one-sentence description of the calculation of the unadjusted mortality factor and a one-page descriptio n and justification for the correction factors applied to 1 August 31, 2005 memorandum to CEC commissioners G eesman and Boyd with the subject ‘Response to public comments on the staff report titled Assessment of Avian Mortality from Collisions and Electrocutions (CEC-700-2005-015) (Avian White Paper) written in support of the 2005 Envir onmental Performance Report and the 2005 Integrated Energy Policy Report’, unpaginated secti on, 157 – 159 of the memorandum. 2 Smallwood K.S. and C.G.

CalWEA Attachment to Appendix 1 – page 2 the unadjusted mortality factor. Although we have great concern about the appropriateness of the correction factors, the error we posit is in the calculat ion of the unadjusted mortality factor itself. From the data in the files given to us by CEC staff, mo rtality factors were calculated for the golden eagle, red- tailed hawk, great horned owl, burrowing owl and ferruginous hawk carcasses in the Set 2 turbines (Attachment 1) according to the calculation procedure desc ribed in the 2004 PIER report. 5 In Attachment 1, data in columns A, B, C and H are taken from the CEC fatality file, and columns D, I and J taken from the CEC search dates file for the turbine st ring associated with the carcass. Column E is our count of the number of individual towers in the stri ng, column F is our assignment of the per-turbine MW, and column G is the number of towers (E) times the per-turbine MW value (F). Column K is the interval between the two searches in that string (I and J), and column L is the study duration (the search interval (K) + 90 days). Column M is the deaths/MW/year for the indi vidual eagle carcass in that string, calculated by dividing 1 carcass by the string MW sum (G) and by the study duration (L). Column N is the sum of the individual string factors (M), and in column O the string factor sum (N) is divided by the number of turbine strings in Set 2 (280 strings) to give the unadjusted mo rtality factor (in deaths pe r MW per year) for the Set 2 turbines. Column P gives the unadju sted mortality factor as shown in Table 3-9 of the 2004 PIER report. 6 For the golden eagles, the first pair of numbers in co lums N and O yields the un adjusted mortality factor produced if only the 10 carcasses with an ETD le ss than 90 days are used. This factor is 34.8% of the factor given in the 2004 PIER report. The second pair yields the mortality factor if th e 10 carcasses with an ETD less than 90 days and the 15 carcasses with no ETD are used. The second pair gives a mortality factor that is 4% higher than that shown in the report. The same ho lds true for red-tailed hawk carcasses – our calculated unadjusted mortality factor only closely matches that reported when all carcasses with no assigned ETD are used along with those with an ETD less than 90 days. The burrowing owl and ferruginous hawk calculations shown in Attachment 1 were performed as a check on our calculation procedure, as none of those carcasses had an unassigned ETD. The factor we calculated for burrowing owls was 0.5% higher and for ferruginous hawks 1.7% lower than the factors reported. As an additional check, calculations were also performed (but not shown here) for one cowbird, one mallard, one raven and two bluebird carcasses from the Set 2 turbines , with our calculated factors matching those reported ± 2%. The differences in our calculated factors compared to those reported are probably due to rounding or some other minor factor, but serve to demonstrate the calculation was duplicated appropriately. The only uncertainties in our calculation of the golden eagle unadjusted mortality factor was the individual turbine’s MW rating and the study duration used by the authors for the golden eagle carcass found incidentally on 13-May-03 (Attachment 1) since it was found two months after searches of that string ceased. To produce a calculated golden eagl e unadjusted mortality fa ctor that matches that given in the 2004 PIER report using only the 10 ca rcasses with an assigned ETD less than 90 days, all the turbines need to average 035 MW and there are none in the Al tamont that small. Th e authors did not addre ss adjustment of study durations for incidental finds, so the original search dates appear in Attachment 1. However, the increase in that string’s study duration to include the date the carcass was found produces a better match with the mortality factor in the 2004 PIER repor t, with ours higher by only 0.9% when the 10 eagle carcasses with an ETD less than 90 days and the 15 with no assigned ETD are all included. There have been many estimates of Altamont golden eagle mortality (Howell and DiDonato 1991, Kerlinger and Curry 2003, Orloff and Flannery 1992 and 1996, Smallwood and Thelander in press)7.

All of these mortality estimates, including Smallwood and Thelander (in press) lie between 28 and 43 golden eagle deaths per year, substantially different than the 2004 PIER report’s 76 – 116 eagle deaths per year.8 In the PIER report, the authors address differences in mortality estimates between that report and their NREL report (in press). They state ‘Our new mortalit y estimates are much larger than those reported in Smallwood and Thelander (in review), but our report to the National Renewable Energy Lab did not include data collected over most of the APWRA where we had not yet been granted access, and it did not include data from the wind turbines because we had not yet completed a full year of fatality searches on these turbines and decided to exclude them from our estima tes of mortality. In fact, we had noticed that the mortality estimates representing the SeaWest-owned turb ines were much larger than observed elsewhere, but we guessed that these larger estimates might be due to time spans consisting of less than a year because the denominator in the mortality estimate would be a fraction and would therefore artificially inflate the mortality estimate, as described in Chapter 3. However, continue d searches at these wind turbines proved that the greater mortality previously observed (and excluded from our report) was no t the result of insufficient time spanning the searches. Mortality at the SeaWest-owned portion of the APWRA substantially exceeds mortality observed over most of the rest of the APWRA’. 9 In the NREL report, annual golden eagle mortality Altamont-wide is 28 and 34 deaths/year for the search efficiency-corrected total and the searcher efficiency plus scavenging-corrected total, respectively. The SeaWest-owned turbines discussed, above, are in the Set 1 turbines. When the PIER report Set 1 turbines alone are used to calculate annual golden eagle mortality Altamont-wide, the total is also 28 and 34 deaths/year for the searcher efficien cy-corrected total and the searcher efficiency and scavenging-corrected total, respectively. The SeaWest-owned turbines do not account for the substantial difference in golden eagle mortality estimates between the Smallwood and Thelander NREL report and the Smallwood and Thelander PIER report. There is no evidence that CEC staff attempted to perform the same calculation exercise we demonstrate here – an effort to determine the source of the unexpected magnitude in the annual golden eagle mortality – despite the improbability of the numbers and our effo rt to point out the sour ce of the discrepancy. That our calculated golden eagle and red-tailed hawk mortality factors match by ‘coincidence’ only when we include carcasses without ETDs in the data files given to us by CEC staff beggars the imagination. If this is the level of critical thought CEC staff has given to an issue as crucial as this mistake in calculation, we have little reason to expect competent assessment of any other public criticism in the remainder of the staff response.
