October 2007 High School Report Test Date: May 2007 ID: 12391648 District: MSAD 45 School: Washburn District High SchoolDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 2006–2007 School Y ear Reports Dear School Board Members and School Personnel: The Maine Comprehensive Assessment System is the State’ s measure of student progress in achieving the State standards, known as Learning Results, adopted by the Maine Legislature in The Maine Educational Assessment (MEA) is administered in grades 3 through 8 to meet these state assessment requirements. Since the spring of 2006, the SAT Reasoning Test ™ (SAT) has been administered to students in their third year of high school in place of the MEA for state and federal purposes. The move from the MEA to the SAT in grade 11 was made to encourage all students in the goal of attaining college and high-level workplace readiness as well as to measure achievement. This year, the mathematics portion of the SAT Reasoning Test ™ was augmented with 18 additional mathematics items (the Math-A test) to more fully measure Maine’ s Learning Results. The combined tests form the Maine High School Assessment (MHSA). Due to the inclusion of the additional items in mathematics, it was necessary to set new achievement level standards for that discipline this year. The new achievement level standards are the result of a comprehensive process informed by Maine teachers and reviewed by advisory committees. The achievement level standards were not changed for the Critical Reading and Writing sections of the MHSA. These 2006-2007 Maine High School Assessment Summary Reports contain the results of student performance on the SAT in critical reading, mathematics, and writing reported according to the achievement standards described above and disaggregated by student and school characteristics. This report, together with individual student and subject-speciﬁ c student roster reports, provides support for use in program evaluation and planning. All scores contained in these reports are included for Maine state and federal reporting purposes only. While scores for many students may also be used for college admission, they may not be used for that purpose if a student received accommodations during the test administration that exceeded those made available by the College Board. These results reﬂ ect scores based on SAT and Math-A test questions that were taken by over 15,000 students who were enrolled in their third year of high school across all Maine public schools. The SAT Reasoning Test ™ employs a design that requires students to create a written response to a writing prompt, generate answers to open-ended mathematics questions, and select answers to multiple-choice questions. More information about the design, history, and use of the SAT can be found at: http://www.maine.gov/education/sat_initiative/. I look forward to working with you in support of our continued efforts to improve the quality and effectiveness of the instructional opportunities designed to help all students achieve the high standards of the Learning Results and graduate from any Maine high school prepared for college, career, and citizenship. Sincerely, Susan A. Gendron Commissioner of Education Maine High School Assessment Contents of the Report The report is divided into ﬁ ve main sections including a section describing the students tested and a separate section for the results in each content area.
