Congressman Olver Denounces "Foolhardy" Surface Transportation Proposal Washington, DC —Yesterday, Republicans on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee unveiled the framework for a controversial multi-year surface transportation proposal to reauthorize the Nation’s highway, highway safety, transit, and rail programs. Breaking with Committee precedent and tradition, the current proposal was drafted by the Republican Majority with no consultation or input from the Democratic Minority. “Although many details of this proposal remain in the dark, based on the funding levels alone, it appears that this bill can best be called the ‘Republican Road to Ruin’ because it would undermine our nation’s fragile economic recovery,” said Congressman Olver. “The foolhardy cuts proposed to highway, highway safety and rail programs will destroy nearly 500,000 American jobs next year alone, as well as jeopardize the nation’s long-term economic competitiveness,” Olver added. The proposed legislation would cut $109 billion in surface transportation investments. Construction unemployment in the United States continues to hover around 16%. ### 1 / 1
