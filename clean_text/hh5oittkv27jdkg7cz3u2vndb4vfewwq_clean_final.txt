I want to thank each of you for your service to the CAB. We have recently been advised that Emile Bernard, the Chair of the W aste Management Committee, will no longer be able to con- tinue as a CAB member. He has been an involved and vibrant member and we will really miss him. Along with Emile, we will be losing three memb ers who have served their six-year term limits. These members include: Judy Greene -McLeod, who most recently served as the CAB Vice Chair and who has served as Chair and member of the Waste Management Committee, has had considerable professional experience at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory. She has been able to direct many CAB inquiries when we delved into biological and environmental issues. She has been a thoughtful, engaged, and active member, and will be sorely missed. Dr. Kuppuswam y Jayaraman, also known as Dr. J, has served as Chair of the Facilities Disposition &Site Remediation Committee and as a member of the Strategic & Legacy Man- agem ent Committee. As a professor, Dr. J has brought some of that demeanor and rigor to the CAB. He frequently makes thoughtful and insightful comments that makes us stop to re- flect and take a more in -depth look. His contribution has been significant. Everyone will miss Dr. J, a real contrib- utor. Alex Williams has served on several committees including Nuclear Materials and Waste Management. Mr. Wil- liams leads the CAB in the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of Full Board meetings. He is retired from the Army and has brought that experience to the CAB. He is quick with pleasant and humorous comments that make the meetings go along just a little bit better. It is always difficult to lose such a personable and upbeat person. The Board had 20 committee meetings in 2011, in addition to six Full Board meetings and a two day Education & Process Session. I and various other members have attended and made comments to the Blue Ribbon Committee, a DNFSB public meeting, two Environmental Justice meetings, and an NRC public meeting. In addition, I have repre- sented the Board at two Site Specific Advisor y Board Chairs meetings, and in a meeting with the United Kingdom Nuclear Decommissioning Authority personnel on a Site visit to SRS. At the beginning of this year we focused the CAB on two areas: giving more CAB input to the DOE and achieving more public involvement. We are beginning to see real gains, and I thank you for your continued interest and involvement. At the CAB’s recent Education & Process Session, the CAB discussed a num ber of issues such as our approach to committee meetings, including attendance, and “CAB Position Statements.” The CAB felt that position statements will help it summarize its message and views on any given topic in a clear and concise way. The CAB has also spent considerable time on increasing its interaction with the public, and will be continuing to work on a number of ideas, such as the Speakers Bureau. With the Speaker’s Bureau, we are actively seeking audiences where we can relay who we are and what the CAB does. Overall, the Education & Process Session was ver y productive. While we seem to be making gains, we will also be faced with a lot of challenges as we go into 2012. SRS does not appear to be getting severe cuts in 2012, but they may loom on the horizon. Overall, the Site continues to make pro- gress on cleanup and that point is worthy of comment. Thanks to each of you for making this year so successful!Message from the Chair –Dr. Donald N. Bridges, CA B Chair The Savannah River Site (SRS) Citizens Advisory Board (CAB) extends a big “thank you” to everyone that helped make this newsl et- ter possible. Thank you to all the CAB members who presented ideas and articles for the newsletter, to all the presenters and manag- ers who make Full Board and Committee meetings great, to the Board’s agency liaisons, and to the Department of Energy for con tin- ued support. W e, the members of the SRS CAB, serve a very important role for DOE and our communities. The Board Beat is published semiannually by the SRS CAB, with publications in November and May.

The Environmental Management Site-Specif ic Advisory Board (EMSSAB) Chairs’ Meeting is an opportunity for all of the EMSSAB chairs to meet with DOE Headquarters to discuss “site-specific” and shared topics of interest. The meetings are held bi-annually and usually rotate among eight DOE field of- fices. The last meeting was scheduled to be held at the Neva- da National Security Site in April of this year; however, follow- ing Federal funding delays, was not held until June. (See arti- cle below) As a result, this impacted the schedule for the next meeting at the Paducah site. It was decided, in coordination with DOE Headquarters, that the meeting would be held, for the first time, via video telecon- ferencing. Cate Alexander, Designated Federal Officer of the EMSSAB, opened the meeting and introduced Dave Huizenga, Acting Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management (EM) who provided an update on Environmental Management. He informed the group that because of known budget cuts, it is important to get SSAB input on priorities. Regarding waste disposition strategies, he said EM was looking at the W aste Isolation Pilot Plant for Greater than Class C waste and wants input on how to deal with waste streams. Each site was given an opportunity to ask questions of Mr. Huizenga and then provided their respective site top three, board- perceived issues. Participating in the teleconference for the Savannah River Site CAB was CAB Chair, Don Bridges along with several CAB members. The top three issues (plus one additional issue) presented for the CAB were 1) concern for the Receipt of Additional Research Reactor Spent Nu- clear Fuel and Continued Long Term Storage of Existing Inventories with No Known, Approved Disposition Path; 2) the need to Effectively Utilize H-Canyon; 3) a need to Prioritize Site Activities in View of Likely Budget Cuts; and 4) since the cancellation of Yucca Mountain, a concern for a Lack of a Federal Reposito- ry for Nuclear Waste Disposition and Storage. 2EM SSA B First Chairs’ Teleconference Successful Several CAB members attended the EM SSAB Chairs’ teleconference. EM SSA B Chairs’ Meeting Held in Las Vegas on June 15- 16 The Chairs and Vice Chairs of the Environmental Management Site Specific Advisory Board (EM SSAB) meet bi-annually to discuss issues and concerns that occur within the advisory components situated at eight DOE Sites. The EM SSAB is a federally chartered community -based advisory board that works to provide the Department of Energy -Environmental Management (DOE -EM) with recommendations and advice on cleanup and other activities. On June 15-16, 2011, the representatives from these boards met in Las Ve- gas, Nevada, for its spring meeting. The meeting was open to the public, with scheduled public comment periods. Dr. Donald N. Bridges, SRS CAB Chair, and Dr. Gerald Wadley, SRS CAB Strategic & Legacy Management Chair, attended the meeting. The various site Chairs presented the three top site issues according to their respective local boards. Dr. Bridges, SRS CAB Chair, introduced the following top three issues for SRS: 1)Concern for the Effective Utilization of H-Canyon, 2)Concern for Prioritization of Site Activities in view of Likely Budget Cuts, and 3) Resolve the Major Legacy of Nuclear Weapon Pro- duction at SRS by Treating and Disposing of Liquid W aste and Closing Tanks. Dr. Donald Bridges, pictured right, attended the June 2011 EMSSA B Chairs’ Meeting with Strategic & Legacy Manage- ment Chair, Dr. Gerald Wadley ,

The Board W elcomes Back Patrick McGuire as co -DDFO In July 2011, The SRS CAB welcomed newly appointed co -Deputy Des- ignated Federal Officer (DDFO), Pat McGuire. Mr. McGuire is no stranger to the CAB-he has always been a regular attendee of CAB meetings and served as a DDFO previously. He will serve as co-DDFO for two years. Serving with Mr. McGuire is co-DDFO Doug Hintze, who will be rotating out of this role next year. DOE- SR has encouraged its Assistant Managers to serve on a two -year rotational assignment as co-DDFOs for the CAB. This practice has served to acquaint and sensitize these senior managers to the needs and requests of our CAB members and the general public. . Patrick McGuire, DOE -SR Patrick W. (Pat) McGuire was named the Assistant Manager for the Nuclear Material Stabili- zation Project for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Operations Office (SR) at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in June 2007. In this role, he provides overall leader- ship and direction for oversight of Federal and contractor nuclear material stabilization pro- ject activities in support of Environmental Management (EM) risk reduction and cleanup mis- sion performed at SRS. Prior to assuming his new role, Mr. McGuire served as the Director of the DOE- SR Nuclear Material Programs Division since 2004, where he directed all programmatic, technical and environmental compliance activities associated with the receipt, transportation, storage and stabilization of Spent Nuclear Fuel, Uranium, Plutonium, and other special nuclear materials. 3 Karen Guevara, DOE -SR We are always grateful to the outgoing DDFO for the valu- able commitment of time and ef forts they consistently show to the CAB program and members, and for that, we are truly indebted to Karen Guevara for her tireless ser- vice as co -DDFO over the past two years. Thank you, Ka- ren!

The Savannah River Site (SRS) Citizens Advisory Board (CAB) met for its annual Education & Process Ses- sion on October 12-13, in Hilton Head, South Carolina. The Board’s newest members met for an additional day on October 11. The Education & Process Session is an administrative meeting that ensures the Board is up-to-date on Environmental Management Site Specific Advisory Board (EMSSAB) guidelines and Board procedures. Educational presentations are given and all members take part in process exercises. The goal is for the CAB to leave this meeting every year feeling more confident in its role of developing recommenda- tions in regard to SRS activities from the public’s perspective. The SRS CA B Masters Processes During its “Education & Process Session” WASHINGTON, DC -DOE recently announced next steps for the Asset Revitaliza- tion Initiative (ARI), a Department -wide initiative to examine ways to work with local communities to support the reuse of DOE resources around the country. These steps build on the recommendations from the Task Force on Asset Revitalization and will facilitate local efforts to support beneficial reuse options at DOE sites, including reindustrialization, manufacturing, clean energy development, nature preserves, and educational centers. Under Phase II, representatives from across DOE will continue to work together to support the review, coordination and acceleration of asset revitalization and beneficial reuse efforts for former DOE assets. Helen Belencan, DOE -SR, is the local repre- sentative to the Asset Revitalization Initiative Taskforce and reports to the CAB regu- larly on DOE and SRS asset revitalization efforts. The Department has a successful record to date in pursuing asset revitalization, in- cluding reducing the legacy cleanup footprint by over 2,585 square miles. From 1996 to the present, DOE has transferred over 8,000 acres of property that have been used to build industrial parks, research and demonstration centers, food processing facilities, training centers, parks and recreational facilities, and con- servation sites. Phase II of the Taskforce will focus on specific steps to help advance these strategies and recommenda- tions. What is Asset Revitalization? Republished from the DOE Office of Public Affairs 4 Bill Wabbersen, SRNS, gave a “Radiation 101” presentation to the CAB’s newest members. Dr. David Moody , Site Manager, spoke in a closed session with CAB members concerning the Site’s future missions. Gerri Flemming, CAB Federal Coor- dinator, captures ideas as the CAB discusses revisions and additions to current Board processes.

As of September 30, 2011, the end of most of the Recovery Act projects, the Savannah River Site (SRS) had reached a 73 per- cent footprint reduction, transforming nearly 228 square miles from contaminated structures and locales to environmentally safe assets. This milestone sends SRS well on the way to ful- filling its 75 percent footprint reduction commitment. The $1.6 billion in Recovery Act funding at SRS fueled more than 3,000 jobs and nearly a half a billion dollars in contracts, providing resources for approximately 120 projects beginning in April 2009. The most recent of these projects to be completed by Savannah River Nuclear Solutions (SRNS) was the reclaiming of P and R Areas, which was finished five years ahead of schedule, netted nearly 63 square miles in footprint reduction, and marked the official end to the areas that housed the Cold War icons, P and R Reactors. These areas are now environmentally safe, and the two Cold W ar reactors are the first reactors in the DOE Complex to reach their in-situ end state. More than 500 regulatory milestones were achieved on or ahead of schedule at the P and R Area Operable Units (PAOU, RAOU). SRNS began footprint reduction across the Site early in the Recov- ery Act. Although massive resources were directed to P and R Are- as since 2009, Area Completion Projects were being worked on concurrently and with equal vigor, safely contributing to SRS’ com- mitment to DOE and the nation. Some of these notable projects in- clude the following: M Area, which spanned 45 acres and included a reactor fuel manufacturing area. In October 2010, M Area was the first oper- able unit to be closed under the Recovery Act at SRS. The deactivation and decommissioning of the Heavy W ater Components Test Reactor (H WCTR) was completed in June 2011. The 455 foot K Reactor Cooling Tower was imploded in May 2010. The Site’s Accelerated transuranic (TRU) program continues to ship legacy TRU waste for permanent dis- position at the W aste Isolation Pilot Plant (W IPP) in Carlsbad, N.M. Since the inception of the Recovery Act in early 2009, the TRU program has shipped 2,000 cubic meters to WIPP and will continue to do so until the 5,000 -cubic -meter inventory has left the Site. Of the $1.6 billion in Recovery Act funds, $200 million was directed to reduce the operation risk of the Site’s liquid waste program. These projects provided infrastructure modifications and equipment needed to prepare waste tanks for closure, to support sludge and salt waste removal, and to facilitate continued waste processing.

On September 29, 2011, SRS celebrated the P & R Area Completion under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act program at the Site. There were many special guests at the program, including Garry Flowers, former CEO and President of Savannah River Nuclear Solutions (SRNS), Dwayne Wilson, the new President of SRNS, David Huizenga, Acting Assistant Secretary for the Office of Environmental Man- agement, David Williams, Section Chief for EPA’s Region 4, and Robert King, Deputy Commissioner for SCDHEC Environmental Quality Control. The event also marked the introduction of the SRS Strategic Plan, otherwise known as Enterprise SRS, and Dr. David Moody, SRS Site Manager, presented a video about the past and future of SRS, outlining future missions and commitments for the Site. SRS Commemorates P & R Reactor Area Closure Judy Greene -McLeod, CAB Vice Chair, was invited to attend the P & R Area Completion Celebration. Garry Flowers, SRNS, presented David Huizenga, DOE -HQ, with a framed photo commemorating the P & R Area Comple- tion. Dr. David Moody , Site Manager, spoke about the Site’s future during the celebration. The SRS Strategic Plan, otherwise known as the Enterprise SRS, was introduced to the public at the September 27 SRS CAB Full Board meeting in Charleston, SC. According to a DOE Press Re- lease, this document outlines the “commitment of site leadership to develop future missions for SRS.” Dr. Dave Moody, Site Manager, announced during his presentation at the September Full Board that “SRS continues its heritage of national service through environmental stewardship, nonproliferation, and national security,” and that the En- terprise SRS “seeks to use the knowledge of our nuclear materials workforce, Site assets, and the strength of the Savannah River National Laboratory to address the nation’s pressing issues.” He said SRS leader- ship is committed to moving forward with the Enterprise SRS vision, and plans to pursue top priority objec- tives, re- shape cultural, organizational, and business practices, and build strong business and inter -agency support networks.

8Disposition Path : Those activities that follow generation of a waste and which con- stitute completion of a life cycle of management of a waste, including but not limited to, stabilization, deactivation, disposal, decommissioning, dismantlement, and/or re- use. The end state is where the item under discussion will no longer require some form of additional work/efforts to place in a safe and appropriate state. Terms and Phrases You May Hear at an SRS CA B Meeting Operable Unit: Operable unit, as defined in the National Oil and Hazardous Sub- stances Pollution Coningency Plan, is a discrete action that comprises an incremen- tal step toward comprehensively addressing site problems. This discrete portion of a remedial response manages migration, or eliminates or mitigates a release, threat of release, or pathway of exposure. The cleanup of a large site such as SRS can be divided into a number of operable units. Operable units at SRS are defined geo- graphically –that is, they are separate waste units (where an actual or potential re- lease of hazardous substance is located) that may be small and isolated, or large Ar- ea Operable Units consolidating several potential release sites, or an entire stream system (Integrator Operable Unit). SRS Operable Units are listed in Appendix C of the Federal Facility Agreement for the Savannah River Site Transuranic (TRU) Waste : TRU wastes are discarded materials that have been generated from nuclear weapons production, research, and development since the 1950s.TRU waste is contaminated with man-made radioactive materials with atomic numbers greater than uranium, such as plutonium, americium, and curium. TRU waste is officially defined as waste contaminated with alpha -emitting radionuclides, having atomic numbers greater than 92 and with half-lives greater than 20 years in concentrations greater than 100 nanocuries per gram of waste. These wastes include such materials as laboratory clothing, rubber gloves, tools, glove boxes, glassware, piping, air filters, plastics, wood, metals, and solidified waste water sludges contami- nated with TRU materials. Record of Decision (ROD) : The ROD is a public document that explains which cleanup alternatives will be used to clean up a Superfund site. A ROD contains site history, site description, site characteristics, community participation, enforcement activities, past and present activities, contaminated media, the contaminants present, scope and role of response action, the remedy selected for cleanup, and any long- term maintenance and monitoring requirements associated with it. Superfund : Superfund is another name for the Comprehensive Environmental Re- sponse, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the federal government’s pro- gram to clean up the nation’s hazardous waste sites. The Superfund clean up pro- cess is complex. It involves the steps taken to assess the sites, places them on the National Priorities List, and establishes , and implements, appropriate cleanup plans. Cleanup under Superfund, or CERCLA, is overseen by EPA and typically a state cleanup authority. Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF): SNF is also referred to as Used Nuclear Fuel (UNF) . It is nuclear fuel that has been irradiated in a nuclear reactor, usually at a commercial nuclear power plant. SNF at SRS is typically from research reactors. It is no longer useful in sustaining a nuclear reaction. 15

Public comment periods are offered at all CAB meetings. When requested in writing, the Department of Energy responds to public comments. At Combined Committee and Full Board meetings, there are two that community members wanting to participate in the public comment process should notice. There is a yellow form , used for requesting written responses from DOE. Responses from DOE will be delivered in as timely a fashion as possible. Community members who submit written public comments can typically expect a response from DOE within 30 to 60 days. These forms are also available at commit- tee meetings. During Full Board meetings, some community members in attendance may wish to sign-up to make public comments. A pink sign-up sheet used to make public comments is always made available on a table at the back of the meeting alongside presentations, newsletters, and other materials. Typically, there are three to five public comment periods offered. The public can sign-up for as many public comment periods as desired. However, there will be no response made to public comments from DOE or CAB members at the meeting. If the sign -up sheet cannot be found, please alert a member of the CAB Support Team. The- se forms are not used at CAB committee meetings. The public is invited to make comments, but since committee meetings are less formal, Committee Chairs will announce public comment periods. How to Make a Public Comment to the SRS CAB This form is used to request responses from DOE to public comments. This form is used to sign-in to make public comments at CAB Combined Committee and Full Board meetings. 9 Check out the SRS CAB’ s Website at cab.srs.gov The Savannah River Site (SRS) Citizens Advisory Board (CAB) website is a great resource for anyone who wants to say up -to-date on CAB Recommendations, activities, meetings, and more.

Washington, D.C. --The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced that the first shipment of transuranic waste using the newly approved shipping package known as the TRUPACT -III safely arrived at the W aste Isolation Pilot Plant ( WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico. The shipment, which originated at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, arrived at WIPP on August 25. The new shipping package – the Transuranic Package Transporter Model 3 or TRUPACT -III –allows the Department to package and ship large -sized transuranic waste in a single box that would otherwise have to be broken down into smaller waste boxes. This new ship- ping package will help accelerate the pace of cleanup at sites across the country, while reduc- ing risk to worker safety. “This announcement is a clear example of how ongoing innovations within the Environmental Management program are helping to increase the efficiency of our operations, speed our cleanup efforts at Cold War sites across the country, and improve safety,” said Dave Huizenga, DOE’s Act- ing Assistant Secretary for Environmental Man- agement. Transuranic waste consists of materials such as clothing, tools, rags, residues, soil, debris, and oth- er materials contaminated with plutonium or other hazardous chemicals. The TRUPACT -III shipping package allows the loading of large -sized transuranic waste into a sin- gle box, instead of repackaging it into smaller waste boxes. This will allow for faster processing and shipping, while significantly reducing the chance of potential exposure to the workers that are preparing the waste to be shipped to W IPP. The TRUPACT -III will be used to ship large box waste at SRS as part of the site’s American Re- covery and Reinvestment Act work to complete its legacy transuranic waste program. In the fu- ture, the TRUPACT -III may also be used at other sites that have large transuranic box waste, such as the Hanford Site in Washington State, the Idaho National Laboratory, and the Los Ala- mos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Large -sized transuranic waste includes contaminated glove boxes, used motors, and large -scale analytical equipment. The design and manufacturing of the TRUPACT -III was completed with $12 million in funding from the Recovery Act. WIPP is a DOE facility designed to safely dispose of legacy transuranic waste from the Cold War to protect people and the environment. Transuranic waste is permanent- ly disposed in rooms mined out of a salt formation 2,150 feet below the surface. W IPP, which be- gan waste disposal operations in 1999, is located 26 miles outside of Carlsbad, New Mexico. First TRUP ACT-III Shipment Arrives Safely at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Originally published by the Office of Environmental Management- Washington, DC The TRUPA CT-III is a new TRU waste transpor- tation package now in use for shipments to WIPP. 10

“On September 29, I had the opportunity to attend an Environmental Justice (EJ) Workshop that was spon- sored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Barnwell, SC. I understood the purpose of this workshop as a way to enlighten the general population on “Environmental Justice,” and to inform them about what resources are available. It was a wonderful, educational meeting for the community. I noticed many surrounding communities were represented at the meeting, with pub- lic members present from areas such as Barnwell, W illis- ton, Elko, Denmark, and Blackville. For me, the highlight of the workshop was the up- dates on the progress of the Superfund Job Train- ing Initiative (Super JTI). EPA is working with Par- sons on a third session of Super JTI. The gradu- ates of the program, referred to as “scholars,” were on-hand to give testimonials of their experiences in the program, as well as their successes. Two scholars gave insight into their journey to employ- ment at Savannah River Site. As a CAB member, and a member of the public, I was very impressed with the presentations given at the meeting, and the attendance. I believe if we continue to educate the communities on environmental issues, those communities will be- come empowered.”Environmental Justice Meeting Held in Barn well on September 29 By: Denise Long, CAB Member Kristin Major, TechLaw, helps make the EJ Program a success. A Super JTI Scholar tells the audience about his experiences with the program. Rob Pope, EPA, gives a presentation on what is going on at SRS. Kyle Bryant, EPA, answers questions from the audi- ence. 11Cate A lexander, DOE Headquarters, Comes to Charleston to Speak to the SRS CA B Cate Alexander, Designated Federal Officer of the Environmental Manage- ment Site Specific Advisory Board ( EM SSAB), presented at the September 26 CAB Combined Committee meeting, held in Charleston, SC. Ms. Alexan- der offered insight and knowledge on how EM SSABs operate, and what the CAB’s role is at Savannah River Site (SRS). Her presentation focused on an overview of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), including the responsibilities and authority given to the Department of Energy (DOE), in- formation that members of EM SSABs need to know, and DOE Headquar- ters' views on the EM SSAB. While providing guidance on membership, Ms. Alexander spoke on commit- tee management, the Federal Register , the DOE Manual, and other key fac- tors that influence who is chosen for board membership. She offered key points for a balanced membership, and reviewed the responsibilities of Ad- visory Board members. Overall, the presentation was very informative and helped many members better understand their role on the CAB. Much appreciation is extended to Ms. Alexander! Cate Alexander, DFO EM SSAB, came up to the mic after her presentation to answer questions.

Recommendation # 277 FY 2013 Integrated Priority List and Budget Input -Adopted May 2011 Summary of Recommendation: Prioritize funding to place em- phasis on the following three pro- grams: PBS 11C H -Cany on/HB Line to operate at a level that al- lows disposition of Pu in HB Line and processes Used Nu- clear Fuel (HEU) in H-Can- yon (and any Pu deemed necessary). PBS 12 L-Areato operate at a mode to fully receive off-site Used Nuclear Fuel as sched- uled and ship L Basin Inven- tory of UNF to be processed in H Canyon. PBS 14C to operate the Liq- uid Waste Stabilization and Disposition System at maxi- mum capacity and expedite the processing rate with the Supplemental Salt Waste Processing Deployment. Recommendation # 278 SRS Waste & By -Products Matrix -Adopted July 2011 Summary of Recommendation: The CAB recommends that the Department of Energy provide an initial SRS Waste & By -Products Matrix in the requested format. The initial matrix should be completed no later than the scheduled November 15th2011 Full Board meeting. The initial matrix should list all wastes and by -products at the site, planned to come to the site or under consideration to come to the site. Provides semi -annual up- dates to the CAB that con- tains the past updates in or- der to facilitate monitoring progress vs. commitments. Provides SRS Waste & By - Products Matrix reports that are useful for posting on the CAB webpage. These re- ports can be in the request- ed format or any other for- mat that the CAB and DOE deem useful to workers and stakeholders. Provides a preliminary, one time, W aste Inventory report. The scope of this inventory is nuclear and hazardous wastes stored in L Basin, H and F Tank Farms, Glass Waste Storage Building, K- Area Material Storage, and E/N Areas. DOE Response is pending. Recommendation # 279 Federal Facility Agreement Up- date Provided A nnually -Adopted Sept. 2011 Summary of Recommendation: Develop a chart, based on pro- posed revisions to Appendix E that shows only those revisions that are deemed to be im- portant to the overall cleanup process that would be of inter- est to the public. A. Changes in milestones or schedules need to be shown in such a way that it is easily ap- parent whether or not each proposed change negatively impacts the level of cleanup or the timeline of cleanup. B. Reasons for proposed changes need to be explained fully so the public understands if changes are due to budget restraints, technical difficulties, technical advances, changes in priorities, or conflicts with other laws/regulations, such as the National Historic Preservation Act, etc. C. If new areas are being pro- posed to be added to the cleanup schedule, the ramifica- tions of such additions need to be explained so that the follow- ing are discernible to the pub- lic: the seriousness of the con- tamination, why areas were not included previously, and the budget impact. Present this information annual- ly to the FD&SR Committee at its August meeting, which would allow the CAB to provide input before the revisions to Appendix E are submitted to the US EPA and SCDHEC for approval in November. DOE Response is pending.

Recommendation # 280 Concern for Receipt and Plan- ning for Disposition of Re- search Reactor Spent Nuclear Fuel at SRS -Adopted Sept. 2011 Summary of Recommendation: Establish a rationale (to be widely publicized) for the concept of receiving RRSNF with no known disposition path describ- ing future plans and commit- ments for disposition planning. Indicate when a realistic plan- ning case for the disposition of RRSNF will be developed. Present such a plan in a Sys- tem Plan indicating interfaces with other related programs at SRS such as the liquid waste management plan. DOE Response is pending. Recommendation # 281 Disposition Costs for SRS Re- search Reactor Spent Nuclear Fuel-Adopted Sept. 2011 Summary of Recommendation: Develop a planning case that establishes disposition costs for the RRSNF in L- Reactor Basin plus the addition- al fuel yet to be received at SRS considering the case that the fuel is processed promptly in H- Canyon and the waste is pro- cessed through the D WPF. Develop a second planning case that establishes disposition costs for RRSNF in L-Reactor Basin (plus any additional fuel planned to be received) consid- ering the fuel is stored in the Ba- sins for an extended period and then dispositioned in a manner that DOE would deem ade- quate. Consider development of a third case (a possible hybrid case) for storage and disposition costs of RRSNF if studies indi- cate a viable case that is worthy of consideration. DOE Response is pending. Recommendation # 282 Impact of Blue Ribbon Com- mission Recommendations on SRS Programs -Adopted Sept. 2011 Summary of Recommendation: Report to the CAB when the Site will be in a position to state the nature and type of impacts of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Site materi- als disposition plans. Report to the CAB when and how the Site will factor Blue Ribbon Committee Recom- mendations into the NEPA documents for plutonium and Spent Nuclear Fuel and appropriate final dispo- sition plans issued. DOE Response is pending. Summary of CAB Recommendations 13Want to See the CAB’s Other Recommendations?

Two Savannah River Site Projects Gain National Recognition Republished from a DOE- SR Press Release AIKEN, SC –The Department of Energy’s Savannah River Site has received Environmental Sustainability (EStar) awards from DOE for two projects growing out of technology research, development and applica- tion at the Savannah River National Laboratory. The EStar awards recognize excellence in pollution prevention and sustainable environmental steward- ship. They are awarded for projects and programs that reduce environmental impacts, enhance site oper- ations , and reduce costs. One award, for Renew able Technology Development, Deployment and Education in South Carolina , is a collaboration between SRNL and the Economic Development Partnership of South Carolina. Through collaboration, SRNL has shared expertise and knowledge of renewable energy technologies with EDP, which in turn has leveraged existing relationships with industry to identify and evaluate specific opportuni- ties. The results have ranged from emissions reductions (through deployment and staging of hydrogen and wind energy technology) to community education programs. The second award recognized a project to remediate tritium -contaminated debris in an innovative, cost-effective way . SRNL identified and tested technology to remove tritium from contaminated concrete and soil by using a high heat source called a “thermal detritiation unit.” Each unit is a concrete block struc- ture housing an array of commercially available heating elements, effectively removing the tritium over a period of time. The treated soil and concrete debris can be disposed at an on -site excavation site rather than sent offsite for disposal, reducing transportation, packaging and disposal costs. Over $1.6 million in transportation cost savings and an avoidance of 400,000 truck miles were realized from the deployment. “These awards are hard to get, and we can all be justifiably proud that SRS has been recognized in this way,” said Dr. David Moody, manager of the Department of Energy’s Savannah River office. “This calls attention to the value of our National Laboratory as a technology engine, and the expertise we have in dealing with challenging cleanup issues. Both of these projects represent valuable contributions not only to the site, but to the region and to other DOE complex sites.” DOE’s Steve Mackmull is the federal lead for the site’s Pollution Prevention program. John Harley of Sa- vannah River Nuclear Solutions is the lead for the contractor organization. The awards are among 15 granted by DOE out of 186 national entries. 14 SRNL -”A Technology Engine,” Dr. David Moody, Site Manager Photo credit : SRNL

15NNSA Announces H -Canyon to Support Plutonium Disposition at the Savannah River Site Republished from a NNSA Press Release WASHINGTON, D.C. –The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) this week approved the use of the H -Canyon Complex to provide approximately 3.7 MT of plutonium oxide feed for the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility from the non- pit plutonium currently stored at Savannah River Site (SRS). The use of the H -Canyon Complex will result in the retention of approximately 90 high-quality jobs in South Carolina, and demonstrates NNSA’s commitment to remove plutonium from the state. “This joint effort between NNSA and DOE’s Office of En- vironmental Management helps us implement President Obama’s nuclear security agenda while keeping 90 high -quality jobs in South Carolina,” said NNSA Ad- ministrator Thomas D’Agostino. “This decision will help us dispose of surplus weapons -grade plutonium while also investing in our current infrastructure at the Savannah River Site.” H-Canyon and HB -Line will initiate start -up preparations for plutonium oxide production in FY 2012. In its next full year of operation, it is estimated that H -Canyon will produce approximately 200 kg of plutonium oxide, and ramp up to a full production rate of up to 1 MT per year in FY 2015. NNSA’s Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation will fund the incremental operating cost to perform this work and has identified the estimated $20.5 million per year of funds needed in FY 2012. This decision will result in a cost -effective approach for producing plutonium oxide for the MOX Facility that utilizes current resources and capabili- ties. Through the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement (PMDA), the U.S. and Russia have agreed to each dispose of at least 34 metric tons of surplus weapon -grade plutonium, enough total materi- al for approximately 17,000 nuclear weapons. To implement plutonium disposition in the United States, NNSA is building the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility to fabricate the plutonium feedstock into MOX fuel. H-Canyon, located at SRS, is the only hardened nucle- ar chemical separations plant still in operation in the U.S. The SRS CA B is always looking for new members to join the Board !

H-Canyon was constructed in the early 1950s and be- gan operations in 1955. It is the only hardened nuclear chem ical operations plant still in operation in the United States. The facility’s operations historically recovered uranium -235 (U -235), and neptunium -237 (Np -237) from alum inum -clad enriched -uranium fuel tubes from site nuclear reactors and other dom estic and foreign re- search reactors using a chem ical separations process. Since 1996, the L -Area Com plex has received about 10,400 UNF assem blies in 506 casks from off -site sources. Underwater storage facilities, called disassem - bly basins, were located in all five SRS production reac- tor areas. These facilities w ere designed to store UNF and target assem blies discharged from the reactor cores. This storage allowed the nuclear m aterials to cool after being irradiated in the reactors. The basins were al- so used to prepare the nuclear materials for transport to the F and H area processing facilities. In 1996, L -Basin equipm ent w as reconfigured to safely handle and store UNF from off-site research reac- tors. By 2003, L -Basin was SRS’s only fuel receipt and storage facility. On October 25, 2011, Several CAB m embers, along with a representative from EPA and Pat McGuire, DOE-SR, attended a tour of H -Canyon and L -Basin. The tour w as very extensive, with the participants being provided overviews of the Spent Nuclear Fuel Program and the Nuclear Materials Disposition Process. The tour took CAB members through L -Basin, showing storage m odels, presenting a handling tool demonstra- tion and a fuel type “show and tell.” The tour concluded at H-Canyon, where m embers w ere able to view the control room, the crane room , and roof top. All of the site subject matter experts were eager to help, and ensured all questions were ans wered. 17The CA B Attends an H -Cany on and L- Area Tour at SRS Historical data provided by SRNS L- Area and H -Canyon fact sheets The CAB members took a moment to take a picture in front of H-Canyon. H-Canyon has been a major topic of concern in 2011 for the CAB One of the many helpful subject matter experts gave a fuel type show and tell. Outside of H -Canyon, the CAB members were given a very informative tool demonstration.
