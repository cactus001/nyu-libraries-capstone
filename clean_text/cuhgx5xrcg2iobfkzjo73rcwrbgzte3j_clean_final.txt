IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN CHARLES G. ANDERSON, Petitioner, ORDER v. 12-cv-578-bbc DEBORAH McCULLOCH, Director, Sand Ridge Secure Treatment Center, Respondent.1 Petitioner Charles G. Anderson seeks a writ of habea s corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 to challenge his continued c onfinement at the Sand Ridge Secure Treat ment Cent er in Maust on, Wiscon sin. Anderson proceeds pro se and he has paid the five dollar filing fee. This case is pending before the court for prelimin ary review under Rule 4 of the Rules Governin g Sectio n 2254 Cases. Prelimina ry review of the petition show s that Anderson is in custo dy pursu ant to a civil commit ment order entered under the state sexually violen t perso ns law, Wis. Stat. ch. 980. Anderson provides scant detail about his commit ment proceedings or his efforts to obtain relief in state court. He appears to challenge a judgmen t from the Circuit Court for Portage County, which denied his petition for discharge under Wis. Stat. § 980.09. Public records confirm that this judgment was affirmed on direct appeal, State v. Anderson, 2012 WI App 52, 340 Wis.2 d 742, 813 N.W.2d 248 (Wis. App. March 22, 2012) (unpublished), and the Wiscon sin Supreme Court has den ied furt her review. The petition lists Secretary Dennis Smith of the Wisconsin Department of Health and Human1 Services as the respondent. The court substitutes the official having custody, Sand Ridge Director Deborah McCulloch, as the proper respondent under Rule 2(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases.

Liberally construed, Anderson contends that his continued confinement is unconstitutional because the state failed to prove that he remains a sexually violen t perso n as defin ed by Wis. Stat. 980.01(7). Anderson has not allege d any facts in suppo rt of this c laim. Nevertheless, it appears that Anderson has exhaust ed his state court remedies with respect to this issue and that he has filed his petition within the one-year limitat ions perio d on federal review.
