Welcome to the INFORM 2023 report. INFORM partners believe that the availability of shared analysis of crises and disasters can lead to better coordination of actors and better outcomes for at-risk and affected people. Specifically, INFORM creates a space and process for shared analysis that can support joint strategy development, planning and action to prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from crises. This can bring together development, humanitarian and other actors to manage risk and respond better when crises do occur. This report sets out INFORM’s vision for a suite of products to support decision-making that are easy to use and open to everyone. This vision involves bringing scientific rigour to the process of analysing crises and pooling expertise to develop shared methodologies. By working together, we can reduce the investments required by individual organisations, assure the quality of our analysis and make it available for the common good. INFORM products help improve the quality of evidence for decisions made at every stage of the crisis management cycle from prevention to response. In this report, you’ll find the latest results of the INFORM Severity, INFORM Risk and INFORM Climate Change indexes, and analysis of past, current and potential future global crisis trends.Shared analysis for better decisions Note: The geographical boundaries and names shown and the designations used in this report are not warranted to be error free nor do they necessarily imply official endorsement or acceptance by INFORM or any INFORM partner organisation.

It aggr egates in formation fr om a range of cr edible, publicly availab le sour ces, such as UN agencie s, governments and other multilat eral o rganisation s. Human anal ysts collect the data and en ter it in to the Index. It is int ended to lead to a shar ed and objecti ve under standing of crisis se verity that can suppo rt decisions on the allocation of r esour ces and ensur e all people af fected by crises receiv e appr opriate assistance .INFORM SEVERITY INDEX Objectiv esHow it wo rks The overall objective of the INFORM Severity Index is to measure the severity of humanitarian crises globally (i.e. between rather than within crises) and on an ongoing, up-to-date and regular basis. It seeks to communicate the current status of crises in a systematic, objective and understandable way. In its use - in combination with other sources of information - the INFORM Severity Index is intended to : Monitor trends in crisis severity over time.Contribute to decisions on the allocation of resources in a way that is proportionate with crisis severityLead to a shared and objective understanding of crisis severity Justify and advocate for action, especially in the case of forgotten or unrecognised crises. The INFORM Se verity Index can be used to support decisions that r equire an unders tanding of the se verity of crises globally or to unders tand changes in cr isis se verity over time.ANAL YTIC AL FR AMEW ORK AND METHODOL OGY The INFORM Severity Index is a composite indicator that measur es the severity of humanitarian crises against a common scale. The analytical framework describes how the Index is constructed. Indicators ar e collected to populate the analytical framework for every crisis and these indicators ar e used to calculate the Index . The Index covers: • The impact of the crisis itself, in te rms of the scope and of its geographical, human and physical ef fects; • The conditions and status of the people affected, including infor mation about the distribution of severity (i.e. the number of people in each categor y of severity within a crisis); • The complexity of the crisis, in ter ms of factors that af fect its mitigation or resolution .

People in the affected area Using the Se verity Inde x The INFORM Se verity Index is onl y one sour ce of in formation that can support decisions about humanitar ian crises. It should t ypically be complement ed by risk, ear ly warning and capacity information.RESUL TS AND INTERPRET ATION The r esults ar e provided by crisis. Each crisis is categorised on a five-level scale fr om very low to very high severity . It is also possible to access the values for different levels of the analytical framework, to better understand the main drivers of a crisis. All the underlying data, metadata and methodology ar e publicly available. The Index is updated every month and can be used for tr end analysis.

Specifically, it is intended to: • Lead to a shared and objective understanding of the impact of climate change on the risk of humanitarian crises • Support policy-making that leads to greater resilience to the adverse impacts of climate change • Support decisions on the allocation of DRR and climate adaptation resources that is consistent with SDG and Sendai targets • Identify inequalities in climate impacts, for example on marginalised groups like people on the moveINFORM Climate Change is a new INFORM product based on the INFORM Risk Index. It incorporates climate and socioeconomic projections to analyse how risk will change as a result of climate change under different emission and population scenarios. INFORM Climate Change is a result of collaboration between the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change and Joint Research Centre of European Commission.How it works INFORM Climate Change incorporates climate and socioeconomic projections into the methodology of the INFORM Risk Index. Specifically, it uses a combination of: • Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) describing the evolution of future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and other radiative forcings • Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) that portray how socioeconomic factors may change over the next century Together, these scenarios are used to project the Hazard and Exposure dimension of the INFORM Risk Index into the future, taking into account changes to climate-related hazards (river flood, drought, coastal flood and epidemics) and the distribution of exposed populations. The epidemics component comprises malaria and dengue. The population projections derived from SSPs are also applied to non-climate natural hazards (earthquake, tsunami) and non-modelled hazards (tropical cyclone wind). Tropical cyclone wind has not been included because changes cannot be modelled with sufficient geographic accuracy. Population and other socioeconomic projections are used to project conflict hazard. In future iterations of the tool, changes to vulnerability may also be included. The projections are applied at different timeframes (2022, 2050, 2080) to calculate the Change in risk and the Vulnerability gap – the level of vulnerability reduction or coping capacity increase required for a country to preserve its current level of risk.INFORM CLIMATE CHANGE

INFORM Climate Change is based on the INFORM Risk Index methodology, so it measures changes in the risk of a humanitarian crisis that could overwhelm national capacity. The results of INFORM Climate Change include the following: • INFORM Climate Change Risk Index baseline – a slightly adapted INFORM Risk Index that allows comparison with future hazard projections. • INFORM Climate Change Risk Index – this shows the future risk, taking into account climate and socio-economic changes for different scenarios and timeframes. • Change in risk – this shows the change in the baseline risk index taking into account climate, demographic and socio-economic projections. • Vulnerability Gap – this shows the change in Vulnerability and Lack of Coping Capacity (see INFORM Risk Index analytical framework), which would be required to maintain the baseline level of risk (i.e. to compensate for increases in risk due to climate, demographic and socio-economic factors). These maps and the following tables summarise the change in risk and vulnerability gap for mid-century (≈2050) under both pessimistic and optimistic climate and socio-economic scenarios.

It aims to inform countries of their preparedness status and support prioritization and implementation of specific actions to improve their capacities. The DPM is based on the INFORM Epidemic Risk Index. The dynamism of the DPM is achieved through frequently updated indicators (such as epidemic outcomes, seasonal hazards, humanitarian crisis severity) and by presenting risks for 5 different acute syndromes (respiratory, diarrhoeal, haemorrhagic, neurological and acute febrile illness). The DPM is updated quarterly using the latest available data.Interpreting DPM results Risks in the DPM are determined by aggregating indicators across 3 main conceptual risk dimensions (hazard, vulnerability and capacity), using multisector open-source data to perform up-to-date contextual assessments. Results are scored between 1.0 and 10.0. Low scores represent poor performance (high risk) and high scores represent good performance (low risk). The notion that higher is better is consistently applied across all DPM scores. Example analysis of country prioritisation The results of DPM can be used for global or regional prioritization based on country syndromic risk or any of its components. Countries are exposed to risk differently depending on the type and nature of the communicable disease, current vulnerabilities and existing capacities. Here we use the DPM to measure variation in risk across different syndromes for countries within WHO regions.

The global average severity score of active crises decreased slightly during 2022, as a result of the low severity of several new crises opened during the year. Regional perspectives The majority of the active crises in 2022 were in Africa. Both Europe - mainly due to the escalation of the Ukraine conflict - and Asia experienced an increase in the number of active crises. Number of crises by region in 2022Average Severity Index score of all country-level crises during 2022 MINMAXKEY Q1Q3 AVERAGEMEDIAN The INFORM Severity Index is released monthly. Here we analyse findings from the Index from calendar year 2022. We focus on country-level crises. We use the terms open and closed for crises that, respectively, met or failed to meet the criteria for inclusion in the Index. Number of crises and their severity in 2022 In 2022 the number of crises rose from 115 in January to 136 in December, corresponding to an increase of 18.5%. Most of the crises that were included in the Index in January 2021 (113) were still included in December 2021. In addition: • 23 new crises were opened • 2 crises were closed Of the 115 crises open for the whole year, there were 83 which maintained a stable severity category. 10 crises deteriorated and 9 improved. Crises with significant increases in severity in 2022 included: drought in Kenya; violence in the Darfur and Kordofan regions of Sudan and associated refugee flows into Chad; the conflict in Ukraine; and cyclone seasons in Madagascar and Mozambique. Several migration and displacement situations also deteriorated markedly, including in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Libya and Malaysia.Increasing numbers of crises in 2022 Number of crises in the INFORM Severity Index 2022 Trends in crisis severity during 2022 Crises with the highest increases in severity in 2022 APR MAYJAN FEB MAR JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC1.5 02.02.53.54.0 0INFORM SEVERITY INDEXConflict in Ukraine Violence in Darfur and Kordofan regions of Sudan Drought in Kenya Darfur refugees in Chad Mixed migration flows in Libya 2022 Tropical Cyclone Seasons in Mozambique Venezuela displacement in Ecuador International Refugees in MalaysiaTropical Cyclones Season in 2022 in Madagascar Nicaraguan refugees in Costa Rica 5.0 5 26 27

Countries that experienced a crisis (INFORM Severity Index Jul-Dec 2022) are shown according to the severity of the crisis and the risk of crisis in the country (INFORM Risk Index 2023). The maximum severity category is shown for countries that experienced more than one crisis. The intensity of the colour shows the number of countries in each position in the matrix (i.e. the correlation between risk and severity). There is a strong correlation between a country’s risk and the severity of a crisis that occurs there. The higher the risk level of a country, the more likely it is to have a severe crisis.Risk predicts the likelihood of a crisis and its severity Here we compare the INFORM Risk Index and INFORM Severity Index results. While the Risk Index can tell us about the structural risk of crisis in a country and how it evolves over time, the Severity Index tells us how this risk ultimately translates into an actual crisis. Likelihood of a crisis From the below chart - a comparison of the INFORM Risk Index 2023 (published September 2022) and results from the INFORM Severity Index for Jul-Dec 2022 - we can see that the Risk Index is quite good at predicting the likelihood of a crisis. For example: • All countries classified as Very High risk experienced a crisis. • 90% of High Risk countries experienced a crisis. • Almost all crises happened in countries classified as Medium to Very High risk. • No countries in the Very Low risk category experienced a crisis. Severity of a crisis A comparison of the INFORM Risk and Severity Indexes also allows us to understand the relationship between a country’s risk and the likely severity of an actual crisis. • 52% of countries had the same Risk and Severity Index category for 2022. • >97% of countries had a Risk and Severity Index category that was the same or +/- one category.Risk category of countries (according to INFORM Risk Index 2023) where actual crises occurred (INFORM Severity Index Jul-Dec 2022) Difference in category between INFORM Risk Index 2023 and INFORM Seveirty Index Jul-Dec 2022 28 29

Population ratio (relative to total population) living in each risk class in 2014, 2019 and 2023Increases in the number of people at risk In 2023, almost 45 percent of the global population lives in countries classified as having “High” and "Very high" risk of humanitarian crises. In 2014, the proportion was 39 percent. This equates to a 22 percent increase in the absolute number of people. Meanwhile, only 20 percent of the global population lives in countries where the risk is classified as "Low" or "Very low". Change in risk as measured by the INFORM Risk Index between 2014 and 2023. Countries that experienced a conflict are identified.Conflict is the main cause of large increases in the risk of crises Large increases in crisis risk over the last decade are largely correlated to changes in human hazards (conflicts, violence, political instability) (Group 1). With a few exceptions, countries not affected by conflicts experienced far less significant changes in risk. Likewise, almost all the countries with very high risk levels (Group 2) are those affected by conflict.

The INFORM Risk Index can be interpreted as the structural risk relating to humanitarian crises. Therefore, it changes quite slowly over time and long- term trends can offer insight into how the structural factors that result in crises are changing over time. Over the last 10 years, we can see some large scale changes in the distribution of risk globally. Global trends in crisis risk Over the last ten years, there has been a general increase in the risk of humanitarian crises at global level. While there has been an improvement in coping capacity, this has been negated by large increases in the number of people exposed to hazards, and to their vulnerability. In other words, while development of institutions and infrastructure has helped decrease risks, this has not kept pace with the increased exposure to natural hazards and conflict, combined with socioeconomic challenges. Conflict, displacement and shocks like Covid-19 crisis were important drivers of increasing crisis risks in the last decade.

Under more pessimistic scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions and socio-economic development, by 2050, more than 1.6 billion people will be living in countries experiencing large increases in the risk of humanitarian crises and disasters (>0.3 point increase in risk score). The number of countries classified as having ‘high’ or ‘very high’ crisis risk will increase from 36 today to 52 (45%). More than 5.5 billion people – almost double the number today – will be living in these countries, which today account for almost all humanitarian crises, and in 2022 resulted in 274 million people in need of humanitarian assistance and financial requirements of US$41 billion. The number of people living in ‘very high’ crisis risk countries will roughly triple from 580 million to 1.5 billion. Even under more optimistic scenarios, there will be significant increases in the number of people annually affected by crises and the costs of helping them as we progress towards 2050.Countries at risk 2050Climate change and socio-economic trends will increase crisis risks 32 33

However, certain regions – especially Africa – will be worst affected. The countries likely to be hit hardest are generally located in Western, Southern and Eastern Africa. Other regions of Africa, Central and South America, and Western and Southern Asia also face increasing risks. Lower income countries will be worst affected. While higher income countries may be able to absorb increases in risk, more than 70% of countries with large predicted increases will not have the resources to cope. This will especially be the case in low and lower-middle income countries, particularly in Africa. Without increased efforts and resources to reduce vulnerability and increase coping capacity in these countries, they will face significant increases in crisis-related human and economic losses, which will further set back development.

Getting on the right path Analysing past and future risk trends of individual countries can help us understand how well placed they are to cope with future crisis risks. Here we compare risk trends over the last 10 years from the INFORM Risk Index with the vulnerability gap in 2050 from INFORM Climate Change. The vulnerability gap represents the amount of adaptation (vulnerability reduction, coping capacity increase) that will be required to maintain the current level of risk. We can identify two groups of countries of interest.• Firstly (Group 1), countries that have struggled with increases in crisis risk over the last ten years AND are facing high vulnerability gaps in the future as a result of climate change. These countries will require particularly high adaptation efforts to mitigate future crisis risks. • Secondly, (Group 2), countries that are facing a high vulnerability gap in the future but have made reductions in crisis risk over the last decade. This could suggest that these countries are on a good risk reduction trajectory, although they will require continued improvements to cope with future crisis risks.Crisis risk trajectories Comparison of recent crisis risk trends (2014-2013 INFORM Risk Index) and future vulnerability gap in 2050 (INFORM Climate Change, Pessimistic scenario combination RCP8.5-SSP3) for individual countries Angola BurundiBenin Burkina F asoEritrea GambiaGuinea−Bissau KiribatiLiber iaLesotho MozambiqueMala wi NigerTogo Tanzania UkraineZambia 00.51.01.52.02.5 −1 01 2 Change in risk 2014−2023Vulnerability gap in 2050 Pessimistic (RCP8.5−SSP3 )Group 2Group 1 Looking back, looking forward Regional and income class overview of recent crisis risk trends (2014-2013 INFORM Risk Index) and future Change in risk and Vulnerability gap in 2050 (INFORM Climate Change, Pessimistic scenario combination RCP8.5-SSP3)Historical risk trends and climate change Here we combine analysis of risk trends over the last decade from the INFORM Risk Index with estimates of how risk will change in the future from INFORM Climate Change. The crisis risk pathway of individual countries in recent years influences how they will be able to cope with future climate challenges. Risk increase in Africa and low income countries From a comparison between regions and income groups of recent past and future risk trends, several points emerge: • On average, countries in Asia and Oceania were able to reduce their crisis risk over the last decade. If these countries continue their progression, they will have less difficulty facing the increasing risks that come with climate change. However, where climate adaptation strategies are weak, this progress could be negated by climate impacts. • Despite some improvements in coping capacity, Africa and low income countries largely failed to tackle increasing crisis risks in the last decade. 6 out of 10 countries with largest increases in risk during last 10 years are located in Africa. • Africa and low income countries are worst affected by climate-related crisis risks. This is true in terms of both the likely increase in risk and the highest vulnerability gap. The latter represents the amount of vulnerability reduction and coping capacity increase that would be required to maintain the current level of crisis risk. Therefore, they will require the largest investments in crisis prevention and risk management to avoid potentially devastating risk increases in future. 35 23 23 30 -0.2 0 0.2Oceania Europe Asia Americas Africa 4 0.6 0.8 1Vulnerability gap in 2050 Pessimistic (RCP8.5-SSP3) Change in risk in 2050 Pessimistic (RCP8.5-SSP3)Change in risk 2014-2023Looking back Looking forward Decrease Increase35 23 23 30 -0.2 0 0.2Oceania Europe Asia Americas Africa 4 0.6 0.8 1Vulnerability gap in 2050 Pessimistic (RCP8.5-SSP3) Change in risk in 2050 Pessimistic (RCP8.5-SSP3)Change in risk 2014-2023Looking back Looking forward Decrease IncreaseRegional overview Income class overview 23 23 -0.2 0 0.2Lower middle income Low income 4 0.6 0.8 1Upper middle income Decrease IncreaseHigh income 36 37

Climate change mitigation and sustainable agriculture reduce future aid needs The results of this analysis show how different climate change and agricultural practices affect future crisis severity and funding requirements. High greenhouse gas emissions scenarios combined with non-sustainable agricultural practices lead to significant future increases in drought-related crisis severity and needs in Ethiopia. Conversely, more moderate greenhouse gas emissions and sustainable agriculture lead to more modest increases, comparable with current conditions. Improving and implementing climate policies that focus on mitigation and reduction of carbon emissions and agricultural policies that focus on sustainable practices will therefore have substantial positive consequences on food security and future aid needs.

The resulting 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) had 3.09B USD in requirements, about double the amount allocated in each of the past 5 years. The Drought Response Plan (DRP), which represents 1.66B USD of the HRP, targeted 17M people, of which 9.9B were facing Crisis, Emergency, or Famine (High acute malnutrition or higher). About 98 USD is allocated per person facing high acute malnutrition or higher. RECEIPT project and storylines The European Union Horizon 2020 funded project RECEIPT (Remote climate effects and their impact on European sustainability, policy and trade) acts to assess remote climate change impacts on a variety of European risks including those related to agriculture and food production, finance, foreign cooperation and development, global manufacturing chains, and coastal infrastructure. These risks in RECEIPT are assessed using a concept called storylines, i.e., physically self-consistent cause-effect pathways of past events or plausible future events to evaluate the effects of a wide variety of factors, including those related to climate change hazards, climate change adaptation measures, and socioeconomics. Storyline development and the INFORM Severity Index In this storyline, a team from the Risk Assessment and Adaptation Strategies division at the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change explored the extent to which food crises may become more severe under future climate change is explored with the aim to understand how food crises can be prevented by food security policies and European development co-operations and development aid. The role of climate and population change is considered using FAO food security projections (RCP4.5-TSS and RCP-8.5-SSS) and UN population projections. The number of food insecure people is integrated into the INFORM Severity framework which can be used to provide guidance for decisions regarding humanitarian aid. Quantifying future changes in crisis severity and funding requirements In a food insecurity crisis, INFORM Severity Index considers people in need (PIN) of humanitarian assistance as people under stress levels 3, 4 and 5, which according to the (IPC, 2004) classifications are in a situation of crisis (3), emergency (4) and famine (5). In this analysis, the impact of climate change and agricultural practices on drought-related crisis needs are assessed. The number of people in need are estimated and are integrated into the INFORM Severity Index, to understand possible future changes in crisis severity. An estimate of drought response funding requirements is made based on the per person allocation from the 2022 DRP.
