VA Mileage Reimbursements Going Up, McNerney Announces January 31, 2008 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressmen Jerry McNerney (CA-11) announced that, beginning tomorrow, veterans will see their mileage reimbursement for travel to VA medical facilities more than double. “In order to access the VA services they’ve earned, some veterans are forced to travel many miles,” Rep. McNerney said. “With gas prices as high as they are that can be a huge burden. Increasing the mileage reimbursement is long overdue and I am proud that we included funding for it in this year’s budget.” Beginning tomorrow, February 1, the beneficiary travel reimbursement rate will increase from 11 cents per mile to 28.5 cents per mile. This is the first mileage reimbursement increase in 30 years. Funding for the mileage reimbursement increase was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, H.R. 2764. 1 / 1
