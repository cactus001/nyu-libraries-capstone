of 6 Purpose The Idaho Department of Environmental Qu ality (DEQ) is seeking information from interested vendors regarding methods to effi ciently and effectively implement a vehicle inspection and maintenance (I /M) program in accordance with Idaho Code Section 39- 116B and pending rule Docket number 58-0101-0901, Rules for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho. Please review the in formation on the following link for specific information regarding the lega l requirements that must be satisfied under the program. http://www.deq.idaho.gov/rules/air/58_0101_0901_proposed.cfm DEQ intends to use the information provided to develop a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement an I/M program. Overview The Legislature enacted, and the Governor signed into law on April 1, 2008, Idaho Code Section 39-116B, entitled Vehicl e inspection and maintenance program. It requires DEQ to enter into rulemaking to establish the minimum requirements for a vehicle inspection and maintenance program when ambient air quality concentrations in an airshed within a metropolitan statistical area ar e at or above 85% of a Na tional Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and motor vehicle emissions constitute one of the top two contributing sources to the concentrations. Based on recorded air quality monitoring data , DEQ determined that the ozone ambient concentrations in the Treasure Valley had for the past 3 years, a de sign value greater than 85% of the ozone NAAQS. DEQ also determin ed (included in this determination are Ada and Canyon counties and the respective citi es only) that motor vehicle emissions constitute one of the top two emission sources contributing to the 85% design value. As a result DEQ entered into a negotiated ru lemaking, and the Board of Environmental Quality adopted as pending, the rule Docket referenced above. Per Idaho Code Section 39-116B(3), the aff ected counties and cities were given the option of (1) entering into a joint exercise of powers agreement with DEQ, (2) submitting an alternative motor vehicle emission cont rol strategy that woul d result in emission reductions equivalent to that of an I/M progr am, or (3) if the affect ed counties and cities do not choose (1) or meet the requirements of (2) then DEQ or its designee must implement an I/M program for the area. DEQ received various responses from the citi es and counties covering all three options. Unfortunately, although the proposed alternat ive motor vehicle strategies submitted by several entities were commendable, they fell far short of the emission reductions predicted to result from an I/M program. Consequently, DEQ is seeking information under this request for information (RFI) to as sist in developing a request for proposal (RFP) to implement the I/M program.

of 6 Currently, Ada County and its cities, ex cluding Kuna, implement an I/M program pursuant to a joint exercise of powers agreement. This program was established as part of a carbon monoxide attainment plan. It is anticipated that the RFP will seek a cost proposal to implement a program in Canyon Co unty and the city of Kuna, and a second cost proposal to implement a program in Ada County. Interested vendors should understand that the I/M program being proposed may include: (1) Canyon county and its cities, and the city of Kuna, or (2) Canyon County and its cities, and the city of Kuna, and Ada County and its cities. With the info rmation obtained during the RFI and RFP process, DEQ will discuss with Ada county a nd its cities the options available. Ada County and its cities may enter into a join t exercise of powers agreement with DEQ wherein they opt to implement the same I/M program as that in Canyon County. On the other hand, they may enter into a joint exercise of powers ag reement wherein they opt to continue operating a program similar to that in operation now. To fulfill the statement of purpose of Idaho C ode Section 39-116B, that is to implement an I/M program in an airshed that is a pproaching nonattainment, it is DEQ’s goal to implement as fully as possible an I/M progr am by the next ozone season, which begins approximately on June 1, 2010. Agency Needs DEQ intends to issue an RFP to identify a successful bidder interested in implementing an I/M program. At present DEQ is aware of f our different types of I/M programs. These include a centralized program, where all ve hicles are tested at a central location, a decentralized program, where vehicles are te sted in various locations throughout the area (this is the system currently in place in Ada County), a hybrid version (incorporating elements of both a centralized and decentr alized programs), and a remote sensing program, where vehicles are screened when tr aveling by a remote sensor. Those vehicles that do not pass the screen test are then re quired to undergo additional testing. This RFI requests information about these programs and any other potential suitable programs. The contractor will be paid th rough the collection of inspection fees from motorists. The fee is capped by Idaho Code S ection 39-116B at $20 per vehicle. From the fee collected, which could be lower than $20, the contractor must pay DEQ monies sufficient for DEQ to cover its administrative and oversight co sts, fund a public outreach program per Idaho Code Section 39-116B(2)(g) and reimburse the Idaho departme nt of transportation for costs associated with the registration revoc ation procedure described in Idaho Code Section 39-116B(4). Response Requirements DEQ is looking for an efficient and cost eff ective way to fulfill its statutory requirement to implement an I/M program. DEQ intends to use the informati on collected under this RFI to issue an RFP.
