TALC AND PYROPHYLLITE—1999 76.1TALC AND PYROPHYLLITE By Robert L. Virta Domestic survey data and tables were prepared by Christopher H. Lindsay, statistical assistant, and the world production table was prepared by Glenn J. Wallace, international data coordinator. The mineral talc is a hydrous magnesium silicate. A massive talcose rock is called steatite, and an impure massive variety is known as soapstone. Talc is used commercially because of its fragrance retention, luster, purity, softness, and whiteness. Other commercially important properties of talc are its chemical inertness, high dielectric strength, high thermal conductivity, low electrical conductivity, and oil and grease adsorption. Major markets for talc are ceramics, paint, paper, and plastics. Pyrophyllite is a hydrous aluminum silicate with a structure similar to talc. Such properties as chemical inertness, high dielectric strength, high melting point, and low electrical conductivity make it useful for ceramic and refractory applications. Legislation and Government Programs In 1999, the U.S. Department of Defense authorized the disposal of 907 metric tons (t) of block and lump talc from the National Defense Stockpile, which is the entire uncommitted inventory in that category; 2 t was sold. Production Talc.— In 1999, 9 companies operating 13 mines in 6 States produced soapstone, steatite, and talc. All but one operation were open pit mines. The producers were, in decreasing order of production, Luzenac America Inc., Barrett’s Minerals Inc., Dal Minerals Co., Gouverneur Talc Co., Milwhite Inc., Suzorite Mineral Products Inc. (Zemex Corp.), Unimin Texas Co. L.P. (formerly United Clays Inc. of Texas), Steatite of Southern Oregon, and NuTECH Minerals Inc. Barrett’s Minerals, Dal Minerals, Gouverneur Talc, and Luzenac America were the largest domestic producers, accounting for more than 80% of the tonnage. In 1999, U.S. mine production was 925,000 t valued at $26.1 million, compared with 971,000 t valued at $27.3 million in 1998 (tables 1 and 2). Production increased slightly in New York; decreased in California, Montana, Texas, and Vermont; and remained unchanged in Oregon. Montana led all States in the tonnage and value of talc produced, followed by Texas, Vermont, New York, Oregon, and California. Mines that operated in Montana, New York, Texas, and Vermont accounted for nearly all the domestic talc production. Domestic production data were obtained through a voluntary U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) survey of U.S. mining companies. Survey forms were sent to 10 companies with responses accounting for approximately 80% of the datapresented in table 1; the remainder was estimated from reported prior-year data adjusted according to industry trends. Pyrophyllite.— Standard Industrial Minerals Inc. operated one mine in California, and Piedmont Minerals Co. and Standard Mineral Co. Inc. operated three mines in North Carolina. Production of pyrophyllite decreased from that of Domestic production data were acquired through a voluntary USGS survey of the three U.S. companies that mine pyrophyllite. All responded to the survey. Consumption Talc.— Approximately 881,000 t of talc valued at $102 million was sold or used in 1999, an increase from 870,000 t valued at $109 million in 1998. Sales or use of talc increased in Montana and Texas; decreased in California, New York, and Vermont; and remained essentially unchanged in Oregon. Of the 881,000 t of talc sold or used, producers reported that 771,000 t was sold for domestic use and approximately 110,000 t was exported. Domestic markets included, in decreasing order of consumption, ceramics (pottery, sanitaryware, tiles, etc.), paper, paint, plastics, roofing, cosmetics, rubber, insecticides, and refractories (table 3). Domestic sales of talc did not change significantly between 1998 and 1999. About 73,000 t of talc was reported under the “Other” category by respondents in 1999. Of this amount, 55,600 t was used in animal feed additives, automobile body fillers, caulks, joint compounds, paint and putties, sculpture media, tile flooring, and vinyl sheet flooring. The remainder of the “Other” category (17,400 t) was used in applications that were not identified by respondents. Most of the imported talc was not included in the domestic end-use data listed in table 3. More than 80% of the imported talc was purchased by mineral brokers who do not participate in the USGS canvass. An estimate of the end-use breakdown based on countries of origin, ports of entry, importing companies, and regional end-use patterns is ceramics and refractories, 15,000 t; cosmetics, 8,000 t; paint, 31,000 t; paper, 12,000 t; plastics, 80,000 t; rubber, 9,000 t; and unknown, 23,000 t. Pyrophyllite.— Domestic consumption of pyrophyllite decreased from that of 1998. Pyrophyllite was used, in decreasing order of consumption, in ceramics, refractories, paint, plastics, insecticides, and rubber. Sales increased for paint and plastics applications and decreased for the others. Ceramic and refractory uses accounted for 61% of domestic

U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MINERALS YEARBOOK—1999 76.2pyrophyllite sales. Domestic consumption data for talc and pyrophyllite were developed by the USGS from a voluntary survey of U.S. mills. Survey forms were sent to 11 companies operating 16 mills in 8 States for talc and 3 companies operating 3 mills in 2 States for pyrophyllite. Approximately 87% of the talc data presented in table 3 was reported by the companies; the remainder was estimated from reported prior-year data adjusted according to industry trends. All the pyrophyllite producers responded to the consumption survey. Prices Talc prices varied depending on the quality and the degree and method of processing. The unit value of crude talc was estimated to be $28 per metric ton. More than 80% of the crude ore value included in table 1 was estimated because most producers do not sell crude talc and could not provide a crude ore value. The average reported unit value of processed talc was $116 per ton. The average unit values of crude and processed pyrophyllite increased slightly in 1999. The average unit value for exports of unmilled talc was $114 per ton, and that of milled talc was $195 per ton. The average unit value for imports was $83 per ton for unground talc, $161 per ton for ground talc, and $932 per ton for cut or sawed talc. Bidding for export licenses on 250,000 t of Chinese talc took place in March 1999. Licenses, in general, increased about $8 per ton to $20 per ton. Industry experts believe that much of the increase in licensing costs could be absorbed through cost reductions by Chinese talc producers (Mineral PriceWatch, 1999). Approximate prices for talc ranged from $83 to $371 per ton (table 4; Industrial Minerals, 1999d). Quoted prices should be used only as a guideline because actual prices depend on the terms of the contract between seller and buyer. Foreign Trade Talc exports increased slightly in tonnage, to 147,000 t, and 5% in value, to $27.2 million. Canada was the leading importer of U.S. talc, followed by Mexico, Belgium, Japan, Venezuela (7,220 t), and Taiwan (4,560 t) (table 5). Since 1990, data reported by domestic producers concerning exports to Mexico gradually have diverged from the Bureau of the Census data. On the basis of industry data, exports to Mexico are estimated to be more than three times those reported by the Bureau of the Census. Talc imports reported by the Bureau of the Census increased by 26% in tonnage, to 208,000 t, and increased by 52% in value, to $35.3 million. Such a large tonnage increase probably could not be absorbed by current talc markets and it is likely that much was processed and stockpiled for future sales. Cut and sawed talc, which has a unit value of $932 per ton, contributed disproportionately to the large increase in the import value compared with import values for unmilled and milled talc. Canada, China, France, and Japan supplied 89% of all talc imports (table 6). Some of the talc imported from Japan was likely to have been transshipments from other Southeast Asian countries or Australia. Approximately 50% (103,000 t) of talc imported into the United States came through the port district of New Orleans, LA, almost all unmilled. Of this amount, 6,700 t was imported from Australia; 86,700 t from China; 68 t from France; 8,990 t from Hong Kong; and 244 t from Italy. The second leading port district was Detroit, MI, with 25,400 t (principally from Canada); followed by Boston, MA, with 21,000 t (principally from France); and Buffalo, NY, with 12,400 t (principally from Canada). The remaining imports were scattered among the many other port districts. World Review China remained the world’s leading producer of talc, followed by the United States, Brazil, India, Finland, and France. The Republic of Korea was the largest producer of pyrophyllite, followed by Japan and Brazil. China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States produced 69% of the world’s talc and pyrophyllite (table 7). Australia.— WMC Resources Ltd. announced plans to build an $11 million mill with a capacity of 35,000 to 40,000 metric tons per year (t/yr) at either its Three Springs or Kwinana site. The mill will permit WMC to use talc from its Three Springs mine for higher value applications. The paper and paint markets in Australia and Southeast Asia are being served by the company’s Amsterdam plant (Industrial Minerals, 1999e). Canada.— Highwood Resources Ltd. acquired a talc mine and mill from Canada Talc Ltd. The mine and mill are located in Madoc, Ontario. Highwood Resources is beginning underground development at the mine to improve access to higher grade ore. The company also is upgrading the mill facilities (Industrial Minerals, 1999b). Trinity Resources and Energy Ltd. began preparing its pyrophyllite mine and mill, which have been idle since 1995, for operation. In 1998, the company acquired the mine and mill, located in Newfoundland, from Armstrong World Industries Canada Ltd. The purchase included the mine, mill, 1 million tons of reserves, and ceramic- and mixed-grade stocks. The company expects to be fully operational in 2000 and intends to diversify from ceramics into pigment and filler markets, such as paint, plastic, and roofing (North American Minerals News, 1999). Italy.— Luzenac Val Chisone SpA opened an underground mine in Rodoretto. The deposit contains high-purity, white, macrocrystalline ore. Luzenac anticipates that production will be 60,000 t/yr. The talc will be sold for polymer, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and coating applications (Industrial Minerals, 1999c). Mexico.— Luzenac Europe acquired 51% ownership of Sierra Talc de Mexico, SA de CV. Sierra Talc is a toll grinding operation with an average output of 40,000 t/yr. It has mines in Guerrero and Puebla and mills in Monterrey and Mexico City. The company mines about 10% of its feed

TALC AND PYROPHYLLITE—1999 76.3material with the remainder obtained from other producers (Industrial Minerals, 1999a). Outlook Markets for talc should be stable and even slightly increasing for the next few years. Major markets for talc, such as ceramics, paint, paper, and plastics, are projected to grow slowly through 2003 as a result of the strong U.S. economy. The plastics market should continue to offer the greatest growth potential for talc, and imports will play a larger role in the U.S. talc market. No major changes are anticipated in pyrophyllite markets, and consumption probably will not change significantly for the next few years.
