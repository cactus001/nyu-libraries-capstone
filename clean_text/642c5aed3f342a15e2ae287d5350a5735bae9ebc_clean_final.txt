3 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021PREFACE Data responsibility in humanitarian action is the safe, ethical and eﬀective management of personal and non-personal data for operational response. It is a critical issue for the humanitarian system to address and the stakes are high. The OCHA Data Responsibility Guidelines (‘the Guidelines’) oﬀer a set of principles, processes and tools that support data responsibility in OCHA’s work. 1 The core audience for the Guidelines is OCHA staﬀ involved in managing data across OCHA’s core functions of coordination, advocacy, policy, humanitarian financing and information management, with a primary focus on the field. The Guidelines are informed by a series of gap analysis studies, research and field testing conducted by OCHA over the past several years. 2 This includes extensive piloting of a working dra/f_t3 of the Guidelines by OCHA oﬀices in ten diﬀerent response contexts in 2019 and 2020, with support from the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data (‘the Centre’). These pilots informed the revision of the Guidelines for finalization and endorsement in 2021. The Guidelines reflect the latest global guidance and policy instructions within the United Nations (UN) Secretariat and the broader humanitarian system, including: • The Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation 4 • The Secretary-General’s Data Strategy5 • The Inter-Agency Standing Committee Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility6 The Guidelines also reflect forthcoming administrative issuances of the organization related to data protection and privacy. See Annex E for a list of the references that informed the development of the Guidelines and Annex F for a selection of additional resources related to data responsibility in humanitarian action. The Guidelines will be revised every two years. 1 As an office within the United Nations Secretariat, OCHA is subject to applicable policies and directives of the Secretariat. For the purposes of the OCHA Data Responsibility Guidelines, the term Office is used to refer to OCHA. However, references to principles and actions for data responsibility within and across 'humanitarian organization(s)' apply to OCHA as an office of the UN Secretariat. 2 This includes: (a) research conducted in 2016 with the NYU Governance Lab (GovLab) and Leiden University to understand the policy and privacy landscape, and to understand related best practices of partner organizations; (b) a survey conducted by the Centre for Humanitarian Data in March 2018 amongst OCHA staff working with information and/or data; and (c) field research conducted in 2018 with the Centre and OCHA offices to better understand how sensitive data is shared and used by OCHA staff and humanitarian partners in conflict environments. 3 UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (2019), Working Draft Data Responsibility Guidelines. 4 United Nations, General Assembly (2020), Report of the Secretary-General, Road Map for Digital Cooperation: Implementation of the Recommendations of the High Level Panel on Digital Cooperation. 5 United Nations, Data Strategy of the Secretary-General, 2020-2022. 6 Inter-Agency Standing Committee (2021), Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action.

5 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021HOW TO USE THE GUIDELINES The Guidelines oﬀer an overall approach and minimum standard for data responsibility across OCHA. Because data responsibility varies across functions and responses, use of the Guidelines will take diﬀerent forms. The table below oﬀers some recommendations for eﬀective use of the Guidelines in diﬀerent scenarios in which OCHA staﬀ manage data. Scenario Emergency Response Preparedness New response environment Existing response environment with no established actions for data responsibility Existing response environment with some established actions for data responsibilityHow to use the Guidelines Staﬀ involved in Emergency Response Preparedness should consider the actions included in Sections 3.1 and 3.3 of the Guidelines. • In the Risk Profiling and Monitoring element, conduct a system-wide data responsibility diagnostic. • In the Minimum Preparedness Actions element, develop a system-wide Information Sharing Protocol and Standard Operating Procedures for any OCHA-led data management activities. • In the Advanced Preparedness Actions and Contingency Planning element, develop a Standard Operating Procedure for Data Incident Management. The OCHA templates in Annex D include notes on their use in Emergency Response Preparedness. Staﬀ in a new response environment should focus on the system- wide actions outlined in Section 3.1 of the Guidelines. Supporting these actions early in a response will set a high standard for data management and position OCHA as a facilitator of data responsibility. Staﬀ in response environments with no established actions/uni00A0for data responsibility have two options for starting to use the Guidelines: • Start with the system-wide actions, such as an Information Sharing Protocol, then build down to support actions for data responsibility within the diﬀerent data management activities led or coordinated by OCHA. • Start by introducing actions for data responsibility in a specific data management activity (such as a coordinated needs assessment) to demonstrate the value of this work, then initiate actions at the system-wide level. Most protracted crisis environments where OCHA is present will have at least some actions for data responsibility in place. In such contexts, staﬀ should conduct a system-wide Data Responsibility Diagnostic (see Section 3.1) to determine which actions to prioritize. 7 Instructions for use in Emergency Response Preparedness are aligned with the IASC Guidelines on Emergency Response Preparedness (draft for field testing), July 2015.PREFACE

OCHA DATA RESPONSIBILITY GUIDELINES INTRODUCTION

8 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021DATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION Data is a critical component of humanitarian response. The management of data relating to crisis contexts, aﬀected people and humanitarian operations allows the humanitarian community to respond more eﬀectively and eﬀiciently. However, as organizations manage increasingly large volumes of data, they also face more complex challenges and risks. Irresponsible data management in humanitarian responses can place already vulnerable people and communities at greater risk of harm or exploitation, e.g. by exposing their location or identifying a key vulnerability. This is of particular concern when humanitarian actors handle sensitive data 8 — data that is likely to lead to harm when exposed. Both personal and non-personal data can be sensitive in humanitarian action. While there is a common understanding in the sector regarding the sensitivity of personal data, determining the sensitivity of non-personal data is more complex. For example, locations of medical facilities in conflict settings can expose patients and staﬀ to risk, whereas this data is typically less sensitive in natural disaster response settings. The Guidelines support OCHA staﬀ in determining the sensitivity of data and taking actions to ensure responsible data management. In recent years we have seen the development of principles, policies and strategies for data responsibility in humanitarian action. These include system-wide guidance, such as the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action, as well as global strategies and policies to guide data management within the UN system, such as the Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation and forthcoming administrative issuances for the organization related to data protection and privacy. Despite considerable progress, gaps remain between global frameworks and their practical application in field operations. The OCHA Data Responsibility Guidelines (‘the Guidelines’) are designed to help bridge these gaps by supporting OCHA staﬀ to apply global frameworks for data responsibility in their day-to-day work. DEFINITIONS Data responsibility is the safe, ethical and eﬀective management of personal and non-personal data for operational response, in accordance with established frameworks for personal data protection. • Safe | Data management activities ensure the security of data at all times, respect and uphold human rights and other legal obligations, and do not cause harm. • Ethical | Data management activities are aligned with the established frameworks and standards for humanitarian ethics 9 and data ethics. • Eﬀective | Data management activities achieve the purpose(s) for which they were carried out. 1.1 INTRODUCTION8 See the Information Sharing Protocol template for more information on how to develop a data and information sensitivity classification. 9 Humanitarian ethics has developed as a principle-based ethics grounded in the principles of humanity , impartiality , neutrality and independence that guide the provision of humanitarian assistance and protection. These principles and related rules are enshrined in various codes of conduct now widely recognized as the basis for ethical humanitarian practice, including: The Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Humanitarian Response, including the Core Standards and Protection Principles, the Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability , and the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in Disaster Relief. For additional guidance on humanitarian data ethics see The Centre for Humanitarian Data, Guidance Note: Humanitarian Data Ethics (2019).

9 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021Data responsibility requires the implementation of principled actions at all levels of a humanitarian response. These include for example actions to ensure data protection and data security, as well as strategies to mitigate risks while maximizing benefits in all steps of operational data management. While data responsibility is linked to data protection and data security, these terms are used diﬀerently. Data protection refers to the systematic application of a set of institutional, technical and physical safeguards that preserve the right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data. Data security is applicable to both personal and non-personal data and refers to technical and organizational measures that aim to preserve the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data. Operational data management is the design of data management activities and subsequent collection or receipt, storage, processing, analysis, sharing, use, and retention and destruction of data and information by humanitarian actors. Such activities occur as part of humanitarian action throughout the planning/uni00A0and response cycle across clusters/sectors and include, but are not limited to, situational analysis, needs assessments, population data management, registration and enrollment, case management, communicating with aﬀected populations, protection monitoring, and response monitoring and evaluation. Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Non-personal data is any information which does not relate to a data subject. Non-personal data can be categorized in terms of origin, namely: data that has never related to a data subject, such as data about the context in which a response is taking place and data about humanitarian response actors and their activities; or data that was initially personal data but later made anonymous, such as data about the people aﬀected by the humanitarian situation and their needs, the threats and vulnerabilities they face, and their capacities. Non-personal data includes Demographically Identifiable Information (DII) i.e., data that enables the identification of groups of individuals by demographically defining factors, such as ethnicity, gender, age, occupation, religion, or location. Sensitive Data is classified as such based on the likelihood and severity of potential harm that may materialize as a result of its exposure in a particular context. Both personal and non-personal data can be sensitive. Many organizations have specific classification systems regarding what constitutes sensitive data in order to facilitate data management practices. A full list of definitions is available in Annex A.

10 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 20211. INTRODUCTIONOCHA’S ROLE IN HUMANITARIAN DATA MANAGEMENT OCHA plays an important and unique role in humanitarian data management across its core functions of advocacy, coordination, financing, information management, and policy. Whereas other humanitarian organizations process data primarily for their own use, OCHA’s data management is mainly focused on aggregation and analysis for the wider humanitarian community. In most responses, UN agencies, funds and programmes, and non-governmental/uni00A0 organization (NGO) partners collect cluster/sector-specific data, such as data on shelter requirements or food consumption, to inform their own response activities. OCHA brings together data from these diﬀerent partners to create a common operational picture of a humanitarian situation. This service helps/uni00A0avoid duplication and supports decision-making by operational and policy leaders in the field and at headquarters. OCHA also plays a critical role in coordinating data management activities across a diverse group of stakeholders. With more actors engaging in crisis response, the hub and spoke model of coordination has shi/f_ted to a network model. In this model, OCHA continues to aggregate data for situational awareness but also takes on the added role of network enabler. OCHA’s data role in a network is to connect partners to one another through the provision of services such as common standards and cloud-based infrastructure for storing and transferring data responsibly. In the age of digital data, OCHA’s network enabler role must take into account the risk of hosting or acting as a passthrough for sensitive data from humanitarian partners and third-parties. The Guidelines are designed to support this role.1.2

11 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 20211. INTRODUCTION10Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action (2021).SCOPE OF THE GUIDELINES 1.3 The Guidelines apply to all operational data managed directly by OCHA, managed on/uni00A0OCHA’s behalf, or managed by humanitarian actors within activities coordinated by OCHA in diﬀerent responses. This includes the following types of data: •Data about the context in which a response is taking place (e.g., legal frameworks, political, social and economic conditions, infrastructure, etc.) and relevant dynamics in the area of focus (e.g., security incidents, protection risks, drivers and underlying causes/factors of the situation or crisis). •Data about the people aﬀected by the situation and their needs, the threats and vulnerabilities they face, and their capacities (e.g., needs assessment data, population figures, mobility data). •Data about the humanitarian response (e.g. 3W data, access data, community perception data and data on humanitarian funding). Common operational data management activities for OCHA include situational analysis, needs assessments, 3W/4W, communicating with aﬀected populations, access monitoring, and response monitoring and evaluation. OCHA’s management of corporate data, such as human resources and financial data, is regulated by existing UN Secretariat rules and is outside the scope of the Guidelines. The Guidelines also address how OCHA should support the implementation of the IASC Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility 10 at the system-wide, cluster/sector and OCHA oﬀice (organization) level. The core audience for the Guidelines is OCHA staﬀ involved in managing data across OCHA’s core functions, with a primary focus on the field.

OCHA DATA RESPONSIBILITY GUIDELINES PRINCIPLES FOR DATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION

--- Page 12 ---
13 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021The following Principles for Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action (‘the Principles’) are designed to inform safe, ethical and eﬀective operational data management in humanitarian action. They/uni00A0were developed and endorsed as part of the IASC Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility. The Principles should serve as a normative guide to OCHA staﬀ and partners in implementing actions for data responsibility outlined in the Guidelines. Implementation of these Principles is without prejudice to the privileges and immunities of the UN. They are presented in alphabetical order; no hierarchy is intended. These Principles are based on a review of existing principles for data management across the humanitarian and development sectors. 11 They are designed to reinforce humanitarians' overarching commitment to Do No Harm while maximizing the benefits of data.12 The Principles also reaﬀirm the centrality of aﬀected people and their rights and well-being in humanitarian action. The management of personal data should be informed by the principle on Personal Data Protection, 13 while the management of non-personal data should be informed by the other principles. Wherever these Principles conflict with one another in their interpretation or application, they should be balanced against each other based on the particular dynamics of the response. In the event that the Principles conflict with either internal policies or applicable legal obligations, the latter take precedent. 11 A complete list of the documents analyzed by the Sub-Group on Data Responsibility is available in the IASC Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility . 12 See Mary B. Anderson, Do No Harm: How Aid Can Support Peace - Or War, (1999). 13 This includes the UN Personal Data Protection and Privacy Principles.PRINCIPLES FOR DATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION 2 PRINCIPLES FOR DA TA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANIT ARIAN AC TION Accountability Confidentiality Coordination and Collaboration Da ta Security Defined Purpose, Necessity and Fairness and Legitimacy Proportionality Human Rights-Based Approach P eople-Centered and Inclusive Personal Dat a Protection Quality Retention and Destruction Tr ansparency See Annex B for a detailed description of the Principles.

15 16 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021 October 2021The IASC Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action recommends eight actions for data responsibility, summarized in the table below. The actions are designed for implementation at three levels in a given response: the system-wide level (e.g. Humanitarian Country Team, Inter-Cluster/Inter-Sector Coordination Group), 14 ‘Data impact assessment’ is a generic term that refers to multiple types of assessments, as defined in Annex A. 15 The Data and Information Sensitivity Classification indicates the level of sensitivity of different types of data and information for a given response. This should be developed through a collective exercise in which different stakeholders agree on what constitutes sensitive data in their context.16 For more information on data incident management, see: OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data, Guidance Note: Data Incident Management (2019).A data responsibility diagnostic entails the identifica tion and review of exis ting laws, norms, policies and st andards in the response; processes and procedures; and technical tools for da ta management. A data ecosys tem map provides a summary of major da ta management activities, including the scale, scope, and types of data being processed, st akeholders involved, da ta flows between diﬀerent actors, and processes and platforms in use. A data asset regis try provides a summary of the ke y dat asets being g ener ated and managed by diﬀerent ac tors in a response. A data impact assessment helps determine the expected risks, harms and benefits, as well as privac y, data protection and/or human rights imp acts of a da ta management activity. Designing for da ta responsibility entails accounting for the Principles for Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Actionfrom the outset of a da ta management activity and monitoring adherence to the Principles throughout the process. An Information Sharing Pr otocol (ISP) should include a cont ext-specific Da ta and Information Sensitivity Classification , articulate common actions for da ta responsibility, contain clauses on personal data protection if applicable and specify how to handle breaches to the pr otocol.A data sharing agreement (DSA) es tablishes the terms and conditions that g overn the sharing of personal da ta or sensitive non-personal data. It is primarily used for data sharing between two parties and typically established at the country level.Managing, tracking, and communicating about da ta incidents requires standard operating procedures for incident management and a centr al regis try or log that cap tures key details about the nature, severity, and resolution of each incident.Existing coordination mechanisms can be used to make decisions about collective action for da ta responsibility at diﬀerent levels of a response. This includes the Humanitarian Country Te am, the Inter- Cluster Coordination Mechanism and clusters/sec tors, among others.DATA RESPONSIBILITY DIAGNOSTICDATA ECOS YSTEM MAP AND DATA ASSET REGISTRYDATA IMP ACT ASSESSMENT DESIGNING FOR DA TA RESPONSIBILITY INFORMATION SHARING PROTO COL AND DA TA & INFORMATION SENSITIVITYCLASSIFICATIONDATA SHARING AGREEMENTDATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENTCOORDINATION ANDDECISION-MAKING ON COLLEC TIVE ACTION FO R DATA RESPONSIBILITY14 1516the cluster/sector level, and the organization level.

17 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021OCHA’S ROLE IN SYSTEM-WIDE LEVEL ACTIONS FOR DATA The system-wide level refers to the highest-level coordination structures in a given response, e.g. the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) and the Inter-Cluster/Inter-Sector Coordination Group (ICCG/ISCG). As the convener of the ICCG/ISCG and various technical working groups (e.g. the Information Management Working Group [IMWG], the Access Working Group [AWG], the Assessment & Analysis Working Group [AAWG], etc.), OCHA has an important role to play in supporting actions for data responsibility at the system-wide level. There are five actions that should be prioritized by OCHA staﬀ at the system-wide level. 3.1 RESPONSIBILITY IN Purpose: A system-wide da ta responsibility diagnostic helps identify common opportunities and challenges for responsible da ta management, informs the prioritiz ation of actions for da ta responsibility, and provides the HCT with a holistic under standing of da ta responsibility in the response. OCHA ’s Role: OCHA is responsible for initiating and facilitating the system-wide da ta responsibility diagnostic and presenting it to the HC T for review onc e finalized. Recommended Approach: /uni2610 Prepare a dra/f_t of the diagnostic based on information available using the IASC OG Da ta Responsibility Diagnostic Template . This will likely require inputs from both the Coordination and Information Management (IM) teams in the oﬀice. /uni2610 Circul ate the dra/f_t to ICCG/ISCG and IMWG members for inputs. /uni2610 Consolidate inputs and finalize the dra/f_t diagnostic for c ollective review and v alidation during a joint meeting of the I CCG/ISCG, the IMWG and other thematic or te chnical working groups as relev ant, e.g. the AWG and AAWG . /uni2610 Share the final diagnostic with the HCT and oﬀer to provide a briefing on the key findings and rel ated rec ommendations for da ta responsibility in the response. /uni2610 Ideally, share the diagnostic jointly with the da ta ecosystem map (see below).

18 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021Purpose: A system-wide data ecosystem map provides a summary of major da ta management activities undertaken in the response. It helps identify data gaps and possible duplication, supports complementarity and convergence, facilit ates collabor ation, and enables prioritization and str ategic decision-making on responsible da ta management. OCHA ’s Role: OCHA is responsible for supporting the relevant coordination mechanism(s) in completing a system-wide data ecosystem map. Upon completion, OCHA should present the ecosys tem map to the HCT for reference. OCHA should also support periodic update s/revisions t o the ecosystem map as the response evolves. Recommended Approach: /uni2610 Pre pare an initial dra/f_t of the ecosystem map based on information available using the IASC OG Da ta Responsibility Diagnostic Template . This should be led by the IM team with input and feedback from the Coordination team. /uni2610 Circul ate the dra/f_t data ecosystem map t o IMWG members for inputs. /uni2610 Consolid ate inputs and finalize the dra/f_t data ecosystem map for collective review and validation during a joint meeting of the ICCG/ISCG, the IMWG and other thematic or technical working groups as relevant, e.g. the AWG and AAWG. /uni2610 Share the validated ecosystem map with the HCT for reference.

19 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021Purpose: A system-wide Information Sharing Pr otocol (ISP) serves as the primary document of referenc e governing da ta and information sharing in a response. It includes a cont ext-specific Data and Information Sensitivity Classification outlining the sensitivity and related disclosure pr otocol for key data types. OCHA ’s Role: OCHA is responsible for supporting the I CCG/ISCG and the IMWG in jointly dra/f_ting a syst em- wide ISP for the response. Recommended Approach: /uni2610 Introduce the concept of developing a system-wide ISP in the relevant coordination forum(s) and agree on an approach and timeline for the process with members. Circula te the dra/f_t to ICCG/ISCG and IMWG members for inputs. /uni2610 Develop an initial dra/f_t using the IASC OG Information Sharing Pr otocol template and circul ate with the ICCG/ISCG, the IMWG and other thematic or te chnical working groups as relevant, e.g. the AWG and AAWG. /uni2610 Present the ISP to the HCT for review and endorsement onc e it has been reviewed by the ICCG/ISCG. /uni2610 All stakeholders involved in da ta management should be made aware of the ISP and their respective obligations.

21 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021Purpose: Coordination and collective action help the response community to monitor progress and identify challenges and opportunities for improving da ta responsibilit y. This also helps foster a ccountability and joint investment in the implementa tion of the rec ommended actions for da ta responsibility. OCHA ’s Role: OCHA is responsible for providing regular upd ates on da ta responsibility to the HC T. OCHA should also promo te alignment across clus ters/sec tors and between actions at the sys tem- wide and clus ter/sector levels. Recommended Approach: /uni2610 Provide regular upd ates on da ta responsibility to the HC T. These update s should c over collective progress, and challenges and opportunities for da ta responsibility in the response. /uni2610 Ensure a consolidated approach by liaising with the I CCG/ISCG, the IMWG and other relevant technical working groups for inputs ahead of HCT briefings and coordin ate follow-up actions as required. /uni2610 Incorpor ate data responsibility as a priority topic in security briefings and ot her relevant presentations in the response.

22 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021OCHA’S ROLE IN CLUSTER/SECTOR LEVEL ACTIONS FOR DATA RESPONSIBILITY Supporting data responsibility at the cluster/sector level will complement actions articulated at the system-wide and organization levels. Cluster/Sector Lead and Co-Lead Agencies are responsible for ensuring the actions for data responsibility are undertaken within the scope of a given cluster/sector response, in-line with the IASC Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action. While the actions at this level are primarily designed for national-level clusters/sectors, regional clusters (covering multiple countries) and sub-national clusters may also implement these actions in certain responses. OCHA has no direct role in completing actions at this level but should raise awareness of the IASC-recommended actions for data responsibility at the cluster/sector level. OCHA can support cluster/sector Lead and Co-Lead Agencies through the provision of technical advisory support and liaising with relevant coordination structures as needed. This includes considering the cluster/sector level actions for data responsibility when providing information management support to clusters/sectors. OCHA may also advise on the development of cluster/sector specific ISPs and other actions at this level. OCHA should monitor the adoption and implementation of actions for data responsibility at this level and promote alignment with system-wide level actions wherever possible.3.2 RESPONSIBILITY IN 3.

Given the focus of this level in the IASC Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action, the recommended actions for data responsibility are meant for OCHA oﬀices. 17 Some actions at this level, such as the development of a Standard Operating Procedure for data incident management, will also be relevant to OCHA headquarters sections in their operational data management. There are seven actions in particular that should be prioritized by OCHA staﬀ at the oﬀice level. 3.3 17 Data sharing between OCHA offices and/or with headquarters sections should be informed by the Guidelines and also follow the forthcoming administrative issuances on data protection and privacy for the UN Secretariat.Purpose: A data responsibility diagnos tic provides an over view of existing da ta responsibility measures within the OCHA oﬀic e and supports prioritiz ation of additional actions for da ta responsibility in the response. Conducting a diagnostic helps OCHA gain an under standing of the policy and g overnanc e, tools and infrastructure, and compet ency and cap acity rel ated to data management in a response. In turn, this under standing helps prioritize subsequent actions for da ta responsibility. Recommended Approach: /uni2610 The da ta responsibility diagnostic should be conducted jointly by a Humanit arian Aﬀ airs Oﬀicer (HAO) and Information Management Oﬀicer (IMO). /uni2610 Use the OCHA da ta responsibility diagnostic template to conduct a diagnos tic at this level. /uni2610 Upda te the diagnostic on an annual basis or when circumstances and/or OCHA ’s own da ta management policies and practices change.

30 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021All OCHA staﬀ and supporting personnel (e.g. contractors, stand-by partners, and secondments) who are authorized to manage data and related resources across OCHA should follow the Guidelines. Although eﬀective adoption of the Guidelines requires/uni00A0action from all OCHA staﬀ, accountability for adherence to the Guidelines rests with senior managers at headquarters and oﬀice level. The Chief of the Information Management Branch and Lead for the Information Management Function is accountable for the adoption of the Guidelines across OCHA. Every year, the Chief of the Information Management Branch will submit a report to the OCHA Data Steward 21 on progress in the adoption of the Guidelines as well as any data incidents that have been reported. The OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data will track and support the adoption of the Guidelines and support the Chief of the Information Management Branch in reporting on progress as outlined above. The Centre will liaise with the Data Protection Focal Point(s)as necessary to complete these tasks. The Centre will also provide regular updates to the global Data Responsibility Working Group 22 on OCHA’s progress and lessons learned in implementing the Guidelines. At the global level, all Functional Leads, and Branch or Section Chiefs whose teams manage data are responsible for ensuring adoption of the Guidelines. At the field-level, Heads of Oﬀice are responsible for ensuring adherence within their oﬀice. Unit Heads are responsible for ensuring the appropriate application of the Guidelines in OCHA’s day-to-day data management work. Humanitarian Aﬀairs Oﬀicers and Information Management Oﬀicers are responsible for supporting implementation of the Guidelines in their respective areas of focus. The table below summarizes key responsibilities of diﬀerent groups/units in supporting adoption of the Guidelines. 21 The forthcoming administrative issuances for the organization related to data protection and privacy establish a set of Data Protection Functions for different UN entities. These include a Data Steward (typically the head of entity) and Data Protection Focal Point(s). 22 The Data Responsibility Working Group (DRWG) is a global coordination body working to advance data responsibility across the humanitarian system. It brings together a diverse group of stakeholders including United Nations (UN) entities, other International Organizations (IOs), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders engaged in the coordination and implementation of humanitarian action. The DRWG began as an Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Sub-Group in 2020 and transitioned into a system-wide working group in early 2021. The primary aim of the DRWG is to coordinate, support, and monitor collective action on data responsibility , primarily through the lens of the IASC Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action.

Non-personal data includes Demographically Identifiable Information (DII) i.e., data that enables the identification of groups of individuals by demographically defining factors, such as ethnicity, gender, age, occupation, religion, or location. 39 Operational data management: The design of data management activities and subsequent collection or receipt, storage, processing, analysis, sharing, use, and retention and destruction of data and information by humanitarian actors. Such activities occur as part of humanitarian action throughout the planning and response cycle across clusters/sectors and include, but are not limited to, situational analysis, needs assessments, population data management, registration and enrollment, case management, communicating with aﬀected populations, protection monitoring, and response monitoring and evaluation. 40 Personal data: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’).An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Primary data: Data that has been generated by the researcher himself/herself, surveys, interviews, experiments, specially designed for understanding and solving the research problem at hand. 41 Privacy: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. 42 Re-identification: A process by which de-identified (anonymized) data becomes re-identifiable again and thus can be traced back or linked to an individual(s) or group(s) of individuals through reasonably available means at the time of data re-identification.

39 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021Risk mitigation: A process for applying specific measures to prevent and/or minimize the likelihood of likely risks related to the processing of data and prevent occurrence of harms or otherwise minimize their magnitude and severity. Secondary data: Data that was originally collected for a specific research purpose or alternatively for no specific research purpose (e.g., national census), and is now used by other researchers for a diﬀerent purpose. 43 Sensitive data: Data classified as sensitive based on the likelihood and severity of potential harm that may materialize as a result of its exposure in a particular context. Both personal and non-personal data can be sensitive. Many organizations have specific classification systems regarding what constitutes sensitive data in order to facilitate data management practices. 44 For the UN Secretariat, the classification system is defined in ST/SGB/2007/6 on Information Sensitivity, Classification and Handling,45 and forthcoming administrative issuances for the organization related to data protection and privacy. Statistical Disclosure Control: Technique used in statistics to assess and lower the risk of a person or organization being re-identified from the results of an analysis of survey or administrative data, or in the release of microdata. 46 ANNEX A - DEFINITIONS43 IASC, Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action (2021). 44 The Centre for Humanitarian Data, Glossary. 45 The UN ST/SGB/2007/6. 46 The Centre for Humanitarian Data, Guidance Note on Statistical Disclosure Control (2019).

40 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021PRINCIPLES FOR DATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTIONS47 Accountability In accordance with relevant applicable rules, humanitarian organizations have an obligation to account and accept responsibility for their data management activities. Humanitarian organizations are accountable to people aﬀected by crisis, to internal governance structures, to national and international humanitarian partners, and, if applicable, to national governments and regulatory bodies. To achieve their accountability commitments, humanitarian organizations should put in place all measures required to uphold and monitor adherence to these Principles. This includes establishing adequate policies and mechanisms and ensuring the availability of suﬀicient competencies and capacities, including but not limited to personnel, resource and infrastructure capacity. 48 Confidentiality Humanitarian organizations should implement appropriate organizational safeguards and procedures to keep sensitive data confidential at all times. Measures should be in line with general confidentiality standards as well as standards specific to the humanitarian sector 49 and applicable organizational policies and legal requirements, while taking into account the context and associated risks. Coordination and Collaboration Coordinated and collaborative data management entails the meaningful inclusion of humanitarian partners, national and local authorities, people aﬀected by crisis, and other stakeholders in data management activities, all where appropriate and without compromising the humanitarian principles 50 or these Principles. Coordination and collaboration should also aim to ensure that appropriate connections are established between humanitarian operational data management activities and longer-term development-oriented data processes and data investments. Local and national capacity should be strengthened wherever possible, and not be undermined. Data Security Humanitarian organizations should implement appropriate organizational and technical safeguards, procedures and systems to prevent, mitigate, report and respond to security breaches. These measures should be suﬀicient to protect against external breaches as well as unauthorized or inappropriate internal access or manipulation, accidental disclosure, damage, alteration, loss, and other risks related to data management. 51 Measures should be adjusted based on the sensitivity of the data managed and updated as data security best practice develops, both for digital data and analogue data. ANNEX B 47 These Principles were developed and endorsed as part of the IASC Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility . The text of the Principles is reproduced as endorsed, with minor additions in the form of references to OCHA-specific policies and guidance where relevant. These Principles should be interpreted in-line with forthcoming administrative issuances for the organization related to data protection and privacy . 48 This includes upholding the IASC, Commitments on Accountability to Affected People and Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (2017). 49 The ICRC Handbook on Data Protection in Humanitarian Action (2020) and the IASC Policy on Protection in Humanitarian Action (2016) offer guidance on confidentiality . These standards should be interpreted in line with existing organizational policies and guidelines. This includes forthcoming administrative issuances for the organization related to data protection and privacy . 50For more information on the humanitarian principles, see OCHA on Message. 51 Data security is specifically important when transferring and sharing data.

41 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021Defined Purpose, Necessity and Proportionality Humanitarian data management and its related activities should have a clearly defined purpose. The design of processes and systems for data management should contribute to improved humanitarian outcomes, be consistent with relevant mandates and relevant rights and freedoms, and carefully balance those where needed. 52 In line with the concept of data minimization, the management of data in humanitarian response should be relevant, limited and proportionate – in terms of required investment as well as identified risk – to the specified purpose(s). Fairness and Legitimacy Humanitarian organizations should manage data in a fair and legitimate manner, in accordance with their mandates, the context of the response, governing instruments, and global norms and standards, including the humanitarian principles. Legitimate grounds for data management include, for example: the best interests of people aﬀected by crisis, consistent with the organization’s mandate; public interest in furtherance of the organization’s mandate; the vital interests of communities and individuals not able to make a determination about data management themselves; and any other legitimate ground specifically identified by the organization’s regulatory framework or applicable laws. Human Rights-Based Approach Data management should be designed and implemented in ways that respect, protect and promote the fulfilment of human rights, including the fundamental freedoms and principles of equality and non-discrimination as defined in human rights frameworks, as well as the more specific right to privacy and other data-related rights, and data-specific rights promulgated in applicable data protection legislation and other applicable regulation. 53 People-Centered and InclusiveAﬀected populations should be aﬀorded an opportunity to be included, represented, and empowered to exercise agency throughout data management whenever the operational context permits. Special eﬀorts should be made to support the participation and engagement of people who are not well represented and may be marginalized in the data management activity at hand (e.g., due to age, gender and other diversity factors such as disability, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or other characteristics), or are otherwise ‘invisible’ , consistent with commitments to leave no one behind. A people-centered and inclusive approach is particularly important in the development of context-specific norms and standards for data management. Personal Data Protection Humanitarian organizations have an obligation to adhere to (i) applicable national and regional data protection laws, 54 or (ii) if they enjoy privileges and immunities such that national and regional laws do not apply to them, to their own data protection policies.55 These laws and policies contain the list of legitimate bases for the processing of personal data, including but not limited to consent. 56 When designing data management systems, humanitarian organizations should meet the standards of privacy and data protection by design and by default. Humanitarian organizations should take personal data protection into consideration when developing open data frameworks. In line with their commitment to inclusivity and respect for human rights, they should ensure the rights of data subjects to be informed about the processing of their personal data, and to be able to access, correct, delete, or object to the processing of their personal data. 52This includes that data management must be relevant, limited and adequate to the intended purpose of data management, which for non-personal data in a sensitive context must be in line with forthcoming administrative issuances for the organization related to data protection and privacy . 53 As part of the United Nations Secretariat, OCHA enjoys privileges and immunities which entail that national and regional legislation on the handling of data do not apply . 54 As part of the United Nations Secretariat, OCHA enjoys privileges and immunities which entail that national and regional legislation on the handling of data do not apply . 55 OCHA must always manage personal data in accordance with applicable guidance, including forthcoming administrative issuances for the organization related to data protection and privacy and the Personal Data Protection and Privacy Principles, which should serve as a foundational framework for the processing of personal data by UN entities. 56 For more information on processing of personal data and the use of ‘consent’ as a legitimate basis in humanitarian response, see the ICRC Handbook on Data Protection in Humanitarian Action (2nd edition, 2020).ANNEX B - PRINCIPLES FOR DATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTIONS

--- Page 39 ---
42 OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data October 2021Quality Data quality should be maintained such that users and key stakeholders are able to trust operational data management and its resulting products. Data quality entails that data is relevant, accurate, timely, complete, up-to-date and interpretable, in line with the intended use and as appropriate within the given context. Where feasible and appropriate, and without compromising these Principles, organizations should strive to collect and analyze data by age, sex and disability disaggregation, as well as by other diversity characteristics as relevant to the defined purpose(s) of an activity. Retention and Destruction Sensitive data should only be retained for as long as it is necessary to the specified purpose for which it is being managed or as required by applicable law or donor audit regulations. When its retention is required, safe and secure storage should be ensured to safeguard sensitive data from being misused or irresponsibly exposed. All other data may be retained indefinitely, provided that its level of sensitivity is reassessed at appropriate moments, that access rights can be established, and – for anonymized or aggregate data – that a re-identification assessment is conducted. Regardless of the sensitivity level, a retention schema should indicate when data should be destroyed and how to do so in a way that renders data retrieval impossible. Specific durations for retention should be defined where possible and, where this is not the case, specific periods for review of necessity should be set. Transparency Data management in humanitarian response should be carried out in ways that oﬀer meaningful transparency toward stakeholders, notably aﬀected populations. This should include provision of information about the data management activity and its outputs, as well as data sharing in ways that promote genuine understanding of the data management activity, its purpose, intended use and sharing, as well as any associated limitations and risks.
