457National Credit Union Administration § 708a.4 is clear which terms the requirement applies to. Guide to model clauses. In the model clauses, italicized words indicate the type of disclosure a credit union should insert in the space provided (for example, a credit union might insert ‘‘March 25, 1995’’ in the blank for ‘‘(date)’’ disclosure). Brackets and diago-nals (‘‘/’’) indicate a credit union must choose the alternative that describes its practice (for example, [daily balance/average daily balance]). Sample forms. The sample forms (B–4 through B–11) serve a purpose different from the model clauses. They illustrate various ways of adapting the model clauses to spe-cific accounts. The clauses shown relate only to the specific transactions described.
