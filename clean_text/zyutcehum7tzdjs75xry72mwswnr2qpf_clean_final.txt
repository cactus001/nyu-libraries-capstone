2 Background, Objectives, Method & Sample Size lAs e-fileproducts come on line, IRS conducts customer satisfaction research for each product, and then continues tracking satisfaction periodically as the product matures. lInformation Form 990/990EZ , the US Return of Organizations Exempt From Income Taxes , is one of the e-file products being tracked. The benchmark survey for this product was conducted in 2004, with the first followup wave occurring in late 2005/early 2006 (and r eported here). lThe purpose of the e-file product tracking research is to monitor User satisfaction with each e-file form; to look for ways to increase usage among Non -Users ; and to provide IRS with quantitative data and analysis to use in making policy decisions related to each product as IR S moves toward its 80% e- file usage goal. lFieldwork for this wave of the 990/990EZ Satisfaction Survey was started in late December 2005 but completed mainly in January 2006 . Interviewing was conducted via telephone from Russell ’s national field facility in Wayne, NJ, with respondents drawn from IRS lists of 990/990EZ Users and Non -Users. lThe sample consisted of 634 interviews conducted among 990/990EZ preparers... n130with Users of 990/990EZ e-file(with half external Preparers answering for client organizations); and … n504with Eligible Non -Users of 990/990EZ e-file(with half also being external Preparers). Sampling Notes : 1) the IRS User list was too small to yield the desired ending sample of 500 –as the program grows, future User samples will increase; 2) the IRS ’s User and Non -User lists separated 990 from 990EZ usage, so respondents were a sked which they use and then to talk about that specific product. Among Users, 63% used 990 and 37% 990EZ (with the base of EZ Users, only 48 people, being too small for analysis vs. 990 Users). Among Non -Users, 75% used 990 and 25% 990EZ (we looked for differences bet ween these two groups and found their responses to be very similar).

Top suggestions are: simplify the Form , make it clearer , allow more user notes/comments , allow direct filing with the IRS , make the Form better organized and easier to navigate ,and make allowances for very small organizations .Meanwhile, Among Non -Users... •Awareness Of Eligibility To Use 990/990EZ e-file was up–from 64% in ’04 to 71% this year. But Likelihood Of Use was down (70% to 64%). •As in ’04, we found two main barriers to use : •Lack of knowledge of how the product works •And not having the right software. •Among those Not Likely To Use, there was also resistance to the perceived added work involved in learning to use it. •Finally, if Non -Users are to be reached with IRS product communication , how is that best done? Via Regular Mail in most cases.Key Findings From 2004 990/990EZ e-fileCustomer Satisfaction Survey In The Other Key Learning Among Users... We found continuing high satisfaction with both signature options –especially the PIN.

Satisfaction With 990/990EZ e-filelAlmost all (96%) of the 990/990EZ e-file Users say they would recommend this method of filing 990s to others. lThis extremely high level of intended recommendation is virtually the same as that which we found in the 2004 satisfaction survey.

8 What Users Like About Form 990/990EZ e-file lWhen we code User ’s reasons for the satisfaction rating, we see (as in 2004) that ease and convenience continue to drive satisfaction with 990/990EZ e-file. Top Reasons For Satisfaction With 990/990EZ e-fileVerbatim Reasons For Satisfaction 2006 Users Total 990/990EZ e-fileUsers Very/Somewhat Satisfied (121) % Ease/Convenience (Net) 57 Easy/easy to use/convenient (unspecified) 17 Less paper/paperwork/paperless 11 Easier than paper filing 6 Don't have to mail it/go to the post office 4 Ease of filing/easier to file (unspecified) 4 All Mentions Of Speed/Saves Time/Etc. (Net) 12 Like It/Satisfied In General (Net) 11 It’s Accurate (Net) 9 Eliminates errors/no errors 3 No calculation errors/checks your calculations 2nI was excited when it became available online because I file all other forms online. I much prefer doing things online because it's easier, you get immediate confirmation that it's been received , and I store it on hard drive, with no paper copies no files We need this. nBeing able to do it on the computer is far easier . I don't have to worry about mailing it & it simplified the process that in prior years I had to do by hand. nIt's easier than filing it manually, quicker , less paperwork . nIt's very easy . There ’s a lot continuity with it , since it holds the information from prior years. When I go back to compare certain schedules, it compares the info, and there is an edit check feat ure that checks the information. nIt was much better e-filing than filing on paper. However, there were some very klutzy things about the information requested which are cumbersome and keeps changing every year –especially where you analyze your basis of support (in the support schedule Part IV -A, Question 26 is a pain in the *!x*). We have no records for 4 ye ars back!!!! It must be set up so we could track donations in advanc e. nIt was too confusing –it needs more plain talk . nI like it, but the instructions are a little confusing .lThe above coded responses show the main drivers, but do not tell the whole story of how Users feel about the product. So, we look to their verbatim responses (to the right) and find that they include some interesting comments as well as suggestions for product improvement.

Comparing 2004 to 2006 ratings of “Very Satisfied”, we see lower satisfaction this year with Fast Proof Of Receipt , Reduces Filing Errors , and Being A Time -Saver ; and higher satisfaction with the product Being An Inexpensive Method Of Filing . lBut Fast Proof Of Receipt is still a product strength, as is Convenience , Better Than Other Methods , Being Paper -Less , and Being Inexpensive . Weaknesses persist however and center around being Easy To Learn and Easy To Use –all of which tells us that while Users find the product easier and more convenient compared to paper filing, they still have problems in learning a nd using it. % Very Satisfied With 990/990EZ e-fileOn Specific Product Attributes

11 How Were They Introduced To The Product & Main Drivers Of Usage lWe probed Users on how they first learned about electronic filing of Form 990/990EZ and found –as in 2004, that they are introduced to it mainly via the Internet, software companies, and IRS marketing and/or communications.lWe asked them what they learned about the product that made them consider using it and found that learning about its ease and convenience are the main drivers again this year (as was the case in 2004).

12 lAmong the small sub -sample recalling information, the top types of information were info at irs.gov and IRS forms, publications, instructions –with irs.gov being the main information source. About 8 in 10 of those recalling information about Form 990 considered it helpful .Exposure To Form 990/990EZ e-fileInformation lJust as we found in the 2004 survey, only about one -fifth of Users said they recall seeing information related to 990/990EZ e- file(vs. the 30 -50% levels we have seen in other Business e-file product satisfaction surveys).

13 Usage Of & Satisfaction With Signature Alternatives l48% of Users use the PIN signature alternative to file their Form, 41% use the Scanned Form 8453 signature document in PDF format , and 11% do not recall their signature method . Usage of the PIN is lower here than in 2004 (when it was 75%). lStill, as we found in 2004, satisfaction is strong for both signature options , especially the PIN.lAsked what they liked about each option , most Users mention the ease or convenience of the method –usually expressed as “it’s easy to do ”, “easy to use ”, or “very convenient ”.

15 70%Awareness Of Eligibility & Likelihood Of Using 990/990EZ e-file lFocusing on Non-Users of 990/990EZ e-file, we see that 71% are now aware that they could have filed 990/990EZ electronically – which is up significantly from the 64% that we found in 2004.lHowever, after hearing a description of 990/990EZ e-file, only 64% of Non -Users say they are likely to use it in the future –which is significantly lower than the 70% we found in 2004.

16 Non-User Perceptions Of 990/990EZ e-file lBased on the product description (plus any existing knowledge of the product), Non -Users were asked for their impressions of 990/990EZ e-file via a rating of agreement with a series of statements. lLooking at their “Agree Completely” ratings, we see that they ba sically know only what Non -Users knew in 2004 –mainly that 990/990EZ e-file provides Fast Proof Of Receipt ; otherwise, ratings (and knowledge) are weak. In addition, we see some decline in rating s of three product image points in particular –Easy To Learn , Reduces Filing Errors , and Allows Necessary Schedules & Attachments . 76 71 4548 4345 41 3441 3438 3138 3435373431 32 273130 2626 2627 Provides Fast Proof Of ReceiptPrivate/ SecurePaper- LessEasy To LearnReduces Filing ErrorsAllows Nec.

The top set of suggestions are to change the program in some way –to simplify it, make it mandatory, or expand it. Reasons For Non -UsageWhat IRS Can Do To Increase Likelihood Of Usage

Use Of Software Package To Prepare 990/990EZ e-file lIn addition to the 45% not using software, another 20% (part of the software user group) are using software without an e-file option . So, in total, software is an issue for 65% of Non -Users and may still be a major barrier to adoption of 990/990 EZ e-file.

20 Communicating With 990/990EZ e-file Users & Non -Users lIn survey measures taken of both Users and Non-Users of 990/990EZ e-file, we found (as we did in 2004) that e-file Users generally prefer receiving product information electronically (via e -mail/irs.gov) , while Non - Users accept electronic info but tend more toward receipt via regular mail . lRespondents were asked if they had tried to access 990/990EZ publications or returns via irs.gov and, if so, were asked about their experiences in retrieving these documents from the website . Users are significantly more likely than Non -Users to have accessed docs at the site, but both groups agree that the docs found on the site provide enough information, are appropriately detailed, easy to find ,and easy to understand.How Prefer To Receive Info About 990/990EZ Evaluation Of 990/990EZ Pubs At irs.govUsers Non-Users Total Respondents (130) (504) % % Via e -mail 81 57 From The IRS's Website -irs.gov 79 58 In The Mail 58 69 From Software Companies 32 26 From News Articles 28 17 From Contact With IRS Tax Specialist/Employee 18 9 Via Electronic Bulletin Board 18 9 From Other Internet Websites 15 9 From Advertising 14 11 Pick(ed) Up At Post Office/Library 10 8 Pick(ed) Up At An IRS Office 5 5 A CPA 4 4 Users Non-Users Total Respondents (130) (504) % % % Who Have Tried To Access 990 Publications/Returns At irs.gov 77 58 (Total Tried To Access 990 Pubs/Returns at irs.gov) (100) (290) % Feel Pubs/Returns at irs.gov ...

21 Rejected 990/990EZ e-fileReturns lOnly 9% (or 12) of the Users and 1% (or 5) of the Non -Users have had 990/990EZ e-file returns rejected by the IRS , with the average number of rejects at about 3 -4 in each case. Users, of course, were far more likely than Non-Users to have made another attempt to electronically file a rejected return.lAmong the 12 Users with rejected returns, the top reasons cited for return rejections were missing data, data not matching, and math errors. lHowever, most of them were either not discouraged by the rejection or not discouraged enough to not try again.

22 Characteristics Of Users & Non -Users Of 990/990EZ e-file lFinally, we looked at the characteristics of 990 preparers in the two survey cells and found that … nAs in the benchmark 2004 study, Users and Non - Users include similar proportions of internal vs. external preparers (it’s about 50% for each type in each cell). nHowever, they differ in employee size and budget , with the Non-User organizations being larger in both respects. nNote that there are very large differences between the mean/average and median number of employees and budget in each cell –this is due to the presence of a few very large organizations, which are driving up the means/averages in each case. nWe also looked for differences between the external preparers present in each cell to see if professional preparers (CPAs/accountants/tax preparers) differed in each group. They did, with the external preparers in the User cell preparing more 990 returns as well as somewhat more individual returns, and being more likely to be an ERO/Electronic Return Originator.User & Non -User Characteristics 2006 2006 Non- Users Users BASE: Total Respondents (300) (504) % % % Who Are Internal Preparers 51 50 % Who Are External Preparers 49 50 Avg. # People Employed By Organization 33 82 Median # People Employed By Organization 6 8 Budget Of Organization Less Than $100,000 41 30 $100,000 To $249,999 16 15 $250,000 To $499,999 9 11 $500,000 To $999,999 10 6 $1,000,000 To $4,999,999 11 13 $5,000,000 To $24,999,999 8 8 $25,000,000 Or More 0 5 Refused 5 12 Avg.
