H-8 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Session I 9:00 a.m. All-trans Retinoic Acid Stimulates Pigmentation Development in Summer Flounder* Michael Baron University of New Hampshire, Department of Zoology Institute for the Development and Evolution of Wet Animals Durham, NH 03824 Dietary carotenoids and Vitamin A are thought to be important factors in the development of ﬂounder pigmentation. However, supplementation of these compounds has yielded mixed results (Kanazawa, 1993, Takeuchi et al., 1995). Retinoic acid (RA) is a hormone derived from carotinoids and Vitamin A. RA has been used to stimulate pigmentation development in the Japanese ﬂounder, Paralichthys olivaceus (Miwa and Yamano, 1999, Haga et al., 2002). This study examined the effect of RA on pigmentation development in summer ﬂounder, Paralichthys dentatus . Larvae were immersed in 5 and 10 nM concentrations of RA for a period of 10 days preceding metamorphosis. Fish were reared for an additional 20 days following treatment. Nearly all ﬁsh in the study developed normal ocular side pigmentation. Fish in the control group also expressed normal development on the blind side. However, over 60% of the ﬁsh in the treatment groups expressed partial or total pigmentation of the blind side. These results support a role for retinoic acid in the pigmentation development of ﬂounder. ___________________________________________________ *Supported by New Hampshire Sea Grant #111381 to Jessica Bolker.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-9Session I 9:20 a.m. Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Hogchoker ( Trinectes maculatus ) Reproduction in the Delaware Bay Estuary Christina M. Hodgson, Stephen G. Piotrowski, Kenneth W. Able, and Thomas M. Grothues Rutgers University, Marine Field Station Tuckerton, NJ 08087 Hogchokers ( Trinectes maculates ) are one of the dominant ﬁshes in Delaware Bay based on a seven-year (1996-2002) survey of intertidal and subtidal creeks. In order to learn more about their basic life history, specimens were collected during May to November from 1999-2002 to determine spatial and temporal patterns of reproduction. Seven marsh creek systems representing lower (12-18 ppt), middle (5-7 ppt) and upper (0-5 ppt) bay along the New Jersey side of Delaware Bay were sampled monthly with replicate tows of a 4.9-meter otter trawl (6-mm cod end mesh). Initial observations based on length frequency distributions and spatial/temporal patterns show potentially mature individuals (85-140-mm TL) frequenting the lower bay during spawning season where salinity is highest. Intermediate sizes (60-85 mm TL) were found further upstream while abundance of young-of-year (YOY) (35-60 mm TL) peaks were found where salinity is the lowest. The differentiation of size classes along a salinity gradient is consistent with the Dovel (1969) model. Veriﬁcation by calculating a monthly Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) over three years helps deﬁne the reproductive pattern of hogchokers in response to seasonal shifts of environmental factors such as temperature and salinity.

H-10 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Session I 9:40 a.m. Global Patterns of Species Richness for Flatﬁshes (Order Pleuronectiformes) Thomas A. Munroe National Marine Fisheries Service Northeast Fisheries Science Center National Systematics Laboratory Smithsonian Institution Washington, DC 20560 Comparisons of species richness estimates reveal interesting patterns regarding the ecological biogeography of ﬂatﬁshes. Within all regions, ﬂatﬁshes are most diverse where extensive continental shelves with complex habitats are located in shallow water. Generally, diversity of marine ﬂatﬁshes increases along continental shelves from polar to equatorial waters, with maximum diversity of ﬂatﬁsh assemblages usually occurring on tropical and subtropical continental shelves within each ocean. Flatﬁsh diversity is also high at continental shelf areas where components from different faunal provinces intermix. Lower than expected diversity is noted on continental shelf regions where cold-water currents and upwelling occur. In all oceans, but especially in the West Paciﬁc, ﬂatﬁsh diversity is lower at insular compared with continental locations at the same latitude. Within each geographic region, continental islands (usually larger with heterogeneous soft-sediment habitats) generally support higher numbers of ﬂatﬁsh species than do oceanic islands (usually smaller with less habitat complexity) located in the same region. Among four tropical marine regions, the highest diversity of ﬂatﬁshes occurs in the western Paciﬁc (125 species compared with 45 in the western Atlantic, 43 in the eastern Paciﬁc and only 38 species in the eastern Atlantic). Diversity of ﬂatﬁshes in northern temperate and boreal regions is greater than that of corresponding areas in the southern hemisphere. Far fewer species are known from temperate and boreal areas in the Atlantic and eastern Paciﬁc oceans compared with those from the western Paciﬁc at comparable latitudes.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-11Session I 10:00 a.m. Stock Structure of Yellowtail Flounder off the Northeastern United States Steve Cadrin National Marine Fisheries Service Northeast Fisheries Science Center Woods Hole Laboratory Woods Hole, MA 02649 This interdisciplinary study evaluated spatiotemporal patterns of abundance, geographic variation in growth and maturity, larval transport, morphometry, and genetics of the yellowtail ﬂounder in the northeastern United States. The results suggest that yellowtail ﬂounder found on the principal U.S. ﬁshing grounds should be managed as separate stocks, despite genetic homogeneity. Two “harvest stocks” of yellowtail ﬂounder have signiﬁcantly different patterns of abundance and biomass over time, with a boundary from southwest Georges Bank to Nantucket. Geographic patterns of size and proportion mature at age indicate two “phenotypic stocks” of yellowtail ﬂounder, with a boundary along the northern edge of Georges Bank to Nantucket. Therefore, yellowtail from the southern New England ﬁshing grounds form a separate harvest stock than those on the Georges Bank or Cape Cod grounds, and Cape Cod yellowtail are a separate phenotypic stock than those on Georges Bank or off southern New England. No signiﬁcant differences were detected between southern New England and Mid-Atlantic yellowtail, or between those from the Cape Cod grounds and the Gulf of Maine. Inferred larval movement reveals a passive southwest drift along the continental shelf. Morphometric analysis showed sexual dimorphism and signiﬁcant difference between yellowtail from U.S. waters and those sampled off Newfoundland, but little morphometric variation among U.S. areas. Genetic analysis also found little variation among U.S. samples. U.S. yellowtail ﬂounder resources appear to comprise a single genetic stock, but signiﬁcant variation in critical life history attributes and different patterns of abundance over time suggest that three ﬁshery management units exist: southern New England-Mid Atlantic, Georges Bank, and Cape Cod-Gulf of Maine.

H-12 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Session II 10:50 a.m. Examining the Decline of Narragansett Bay Winter Flounder Allison Delong and Jeremy Collie University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography Narragansett, RI 02882 The Narragansett Bay winter ﬂounder population has experienced a severe decline in abundance over the last two decades, as evidenced by catches in the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, Division of Fish and Wildlife and University of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography standardized trawl surveys. Although regional populations (southern Massachusetts, Long Island Sound, Rhode Island Sound) of winter ﬂounder have also experienced declines, they do not appear to have been as severe as those observed in Narragansett Bay and several of these other populations have begun to recover under strict ﬁshing regulations. The principle objective of this study was to use ﬁeld data to describe the decline of winter ﬂounder in Narragansett Bay and to ﬁnd evidence of those factors that have led to the decline and have kept it from rebuilding at the rates experienced by regional populations. We ﬁrst present a comparative analysis of several regional populations: Narragansett Bay, Mt. Hope Bay, southern Massachusetts, Long Island Sound and Niantic River, CT. To do this, we estimated the abundance of and mortality rates between 7 life stages: egg, larval, young-of-the-year (YOY) spring, YOY fall, age-1 spring, age-1 fall, and age-2 spring. We then examined environmental variables that may have affected winter ﬂounder abundance and mortality rates within Narragansett Bay. The variables considered included age-class abundance, year, water temperature, precipitation, ﬁshing mortality, seal abundance, double-crested cormorant abundance, chlorine discharge from wastewater treatment facilities, dissolved oxygen, salinity and power plant ﬂow and heat load. Stepwise regression and regression tree analyses were performed to determine those environmental variables that best explain changes in stage-speciﬁc mortality rates.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-13Session II 11:10 a.m. Optimal Release Strategies for Winter Flounder Stock Enhancement Elizabeth A. Fairchild and W. Huntting Howell University of New Hampshire Department of Zoology Durham, NH 03824 As part of a program to assess the feasibility of winter ﬂounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus , stock enhancement, optimal release size, site, season, and condition of caged cultured juvenile winter ﬂounder were evaluated. To determine optimal release size, the predator-prey size relationship between winter ﬂounder and the green crab, Carcinus maenas , was examined. The number of ﬂounder killed per day was signiﬁcantly higher (31%) in winter ﬂounder < 20-mm compared to all other larger ﬁsh size classes (4-8% killed/day). Additionally, these ﬁsh were attacked at a faster rate than any other ﬁsh size class. These results suggest that only ﬂounder > 20-mm should be released. Field studies were conducted in three potential release sites in the Great Bay Estuary during 1999- 2001 to determine optimal release site and season. Optimal site selection was based on growth and survival of caged cultured ﬁsh in relation to water temperature, prey availability, and sediment composition. Optimal season was selected based on the temporal distribution, abundance, and sizes of wild ﬂounder, and their primary prey and predators. Within the estuary, Broad Cove was chosen as the optimal release site due to high ﬁsh growth rates coupled with the high prey availability and sandy substrate. Although predators were equally abundant throughout the summer months, early summer was determined as the most appropriate time for winter ﬂounder releases because prey were most abundant and wild ﬂounder sizes were similar to the optimal release size for cultured ﬁsh. The condition of the cultured ﬂounder was studied through a series of experiments to evaluate their vulnerability to predation based on behavior, color, and substrate preference. Cultured winter ﬂounder reacted differently than wild ﬂounder when exposed to cues from a potential predator and were signiﬁcantly more vulnerable to predation by birds, regardless of ﬁsh color. Additionally, cultured ﬂounder selected sediments consisting of small grains and of colors matching their own pigment. Prior to any winter ﬂounder enhancement effort, pilot-scale releases should be conducted to test release strategies.

H-14 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Session II 11:30 a.m. Metamorphosis in Summer Flounder: Manipulation of Rearing Salinity to Synchronize Settling Behavior, Growth and Development* Steven Gavlik and Jennifer L. Specker University of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography Narragansett, RI 02882 In the aquaculture of summer ﬂounder ( Paralichthys dentatus ), the inherent variation in growth and settling behavior during metamorphosis may lead to cannibalism and necessitate increased labor due to size grading. Our goal was to use an environmental salinity change to synchronize settling behavior and produce a uniformly sized cohort of juvenile summer ﬂounder. Early metamorphic summer ﬂounder (Age: 41 dah) were exposed to either a 5-day ﬂuctuating (30-20-30-20-30 ppt; “Flux”) or a single (30-20 ppt; “Low Salinity”) drop in rearing salinity. The Flux group was reared at 30 ppt while the Low Salinity group remained at 20 ppt until sampling at 61 dah. A control (continuous 30 ppt) was used for comparison. For all treatments, the initial n=60 ﬁsh/tank, and 3 tanks/treatment. Settling behavior in the control was prolonged, with the Peak Settlement Interval (PSI; deﬁned as the interval beginning on the day the ﬁrst 20% settled until the day 80% had settled) requiring 8 days. Settling behavior was synchronized by the Low Salinity treatment, with the PSI reduced to 5 days. The Flux treatment negatively affected settling behavior with the PSI increased to 10 days. By 61 dah, average ﬁsh size was increased by the Low Salinity treatment (19.3 ± 0.5 mm), but not the Flux treatment (17.2 ± 0.4 mm), compared to the control (17.6 ± 0.5 mm). Developmental stage at 61 dah was signiﬁcantly increased in the Low Salinity treatment (3.2 ± 0.1) in comparison to the Flux (2.9 ± 0.1), but not the control (3.1 ± 0.1). However, the Low Salinity treatment reduced variance in development. To conﬁrm the positive effects of the Low Salinity treatment, a second experiment was performed. A single salinity drop (30-20 ppt) at 37 dah (Low Salinity2) was compared to a control (continuous 30 ppt). In this experiment, the Low Salinity2 treatment did not synchronize settling. The PSI for the Low Salinity2 treatment was 14 days while the control was 13 days. Additionally, by 58 dah, average ﬁsh length (16.8 ± 0.2 mm) and developmental stage (2.9 ± 0.1) in the Low Salinity2 treatment was not signiﬁcantly different than the control (16.1 ±0.2 mm; 2.8 ± 0.1). Variance in both length and developmental stage at 58 dah in the Low Salinity2 treatment was not signiﬁcantly reduced compared to the control. Percent survival was unaffected by treatment in both experiments. In aquaculture, the effective synchronization of settling behavior and growth through environmental manipulations may reduce the labor costs associated with size grading. A ﬂuctuating salinity regime is not effective in this regard. A single drop in rearing salinity may result in synchronization of settlement and development and an increase in size. Future work will consider combining a single salinity drop (to 20 ppt) treatment with our previously reported thyroid hormone manipulation treatment (Gavlik et al., 2002). ___________________________________________________ *This work was supported by Rhode Island Sea Grant, under NOAA Grant No NA16RG1057.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-15Session III 1:10 p.m. Active Sulfate Secretion by the Intestine of Winter Flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus* Ryan M. Pelis1 and J. Larry Renfro2 1Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory Salisbury Cove, ME 04672 2University of Connecticut Department of Physiology and Neurobiology Storrs, CT 06269 Marine teleosts are hypoosmotic to their surrounding environment and must continuously drink seawater to avoid dehydration. It is widely accepted that water uptake across the marine teleost intestine is driven by active absorption of monovalent ions (Na + and Cl-). However, intestinal transport of divalent ions (SO42-, Mg2+, and Ca2+) has been less intensively studied. In this study, SO42- transport by winter ﬂounder ( Pseuodopleuronectes americanus ) intestine was characterized in Ussing chambers. Under short- circuited conditions and 1 mM SO42- on both sides, net active SO42- secretion (blood-to-lumen) occurred (7.42 ± 0.63 nmoles x cm-2 x hr-1). Treatment with NaCN (10 mM) or ouabain (0.1 mM) inhibited net secretion indicating dependence on metabolism and the plasma membrane Na+ gradient. Luminal treatment with the anion exchange inhibitor 4, 4’-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2-2’-disulfonic acid (DIDS, 0.2 mM) also inhibited net secretion. Removal of Cl - alone, and Cl- and HCO3- together from the luminal bath solution reduced net SO42- secretion. Removal of HCO3- alone stimulated net secretion. Sulfate uptake into foregut brush-border membrane vesicles was stimulated by a trans-Cl- gradient (in>out), and unaffected by a trans- HCO3- gradient (in>out). Short-circuiting with K+, in=out, and valinomycin had no effect on Cl--stimulated SO42- uptake suggesting electroneutral exchange. These data indicate that the winter ﬂounder intestine actively secretes SO42- by exchanging for luminal Cl-. This process may function in water absorption and in the maintenance of plasma SO42- homeostasis. ___________________________________________________ *Supported by NSF.

Fogarty1, Karen Bolles2, Cheryl G. Milliken3, and Rich W. Langton4 1National Marine Fisheries Service Northeast Fisheries Science Center Woods Hole Laboratory Woods Hole, MA 02543 2Marine Research Institute, Skulagata, 121 Reykjavik, Iceland 3Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, Pocasset, MA 02559 4Buccoo Reef Trust, TLH Ofﬁce Building, Scarborough Tobago, West Indies The Georges Bank ﬁsh community has undergone drastic changes over the past several decades, including dramatic declines in the abundance of key ﬂatﬁsh species. Many of these declines have been attributed to intensive ﬁshing pressure. Flatﬁsh are both directly susceptible to ﬁshing gears and indirectly susceptible to the impact of those gears on the ocean bottom. Thus, Georges Bank ﬂatﬁshes play multiple roles as populations highlight the need to understand the role of these ﬁsh as predators, competitors, and prey. We present estimates of relative abundance for major ﬂatﬁshes from research surveys, which demonstrate that even with a recent recovering trend for a few species due to area closures, most ﬂatﬁshes are far from their levels of historical abundance. Because ﬂatﬁshes serve as a major energy pathway for conversion of benthic production into a form suitable for consumption by higher predators and humans, we then examined the diet of nine major ﬂatﬁshes from this ecosystem including primarily polychaete- crustacean feeding or piscivorous species, with one echinoderm specialist. From this information, we assess the magnitude of predation by ﬂatﬁsh on other components of the food web. Additionally, we evaluate the degree of competition among the ﬂatﬁshes and between the ﬂatﬁshes and other ﬁsh species via diet overlap, spatial overlap, interaction coefﬁcient estimates, and cross-correlation of population abundances. Skates are the primary competitor of ﬂatﬁshes in this ecosystem and have the potential to competitively depress some ﬂatﬁsh populations. Finally, we explore the implications of ﬂatﬁsh trophic ecology with respect to different ﬂatﬁsh population recoveries and how the Georges Bank ecosystem may function in the future.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-17Session III 1:50 p.m. Tidal Rhythms in Winter Flounder Beth Phelan National Marine Fisheries Service Northeast Fisheries Science Center James J. Howard Marine Sciences Laboratory Highlands, NJ 07732 Knowledge of endogenous rhythms provides important life history information that helps us understand the dynamic nature of habitat selection. Activity rhythms of winter ﬂounder under controlled condition in the laboratory were observed and compared with the distribution pattern of winter ﬂounder at high and low tides in the ﬁeld. In the laboratory, all sizes of winter ﬂounder tested (20-69 mm TL) exhibited high activity levels following high tide. Winter ﬂounder in the ﬁeld were more abundant across certain depths that shifted with the tide. It is hypothesized that winter ﬂounder movement patterns allow them to take advantage of feeding opportunities and to avoid predation.

H-18 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Session III 2:10 p.m. Winter Flounder Mortality on an Estuarine Nursery Ground: A Preliminary Analysis of Coarse and Fine Scale Habitat Patterns John P. Manderson1, Jeff Pessutti1, Patricia Shaheen1, and Francis Juanes2 1National Marine Fisheries Service Northeast Fisheries Science Center James J. Howard Marine Sciences Laboratory Highlands, NJ 07732 2University of Massachusetts Department of Natural Resources Conservation Amherst, MA 01003 In the Navesink River/Sandy Hook Bay estuarine system, New Jersey winter ﬂounder larvae are known to settle throughout the estuary but spatial settlement patterns are rapidly modiﬁed by postsettlement mortality and/or emigration. In this study, we performed chronological tethering experiments and trammel net surveys at both coarse and ﬁne spatial scales to test the hypothesis that predation mortality was responsible for the alteration of the settlement pattern. Coarse scale experiments showed that survivorship for tethered ﬂounder (20-40 mm standard length) during the settlement period (late April - mid May) was variable but generally high throughout the estuary. However, as the season progressed, survival declined in the Navesink River and was lower in the region than in Sandy Hook Bay. Patterns of predator abundance and diets from trammel net collections suggest that summer ﬂounder, searobins, and blue crabs were probably responsible for ﬂounder mortality. Fine scale experiments performed in the Navesink River during the post-settlement period (June -July) to examine habitat effects showed that the survivorship of juveniles (40-60 mm SL) was signiﬁcantly higher in shallow water (<50 cm) than in adjacent deep habitats (>150 cm) that lacked structural complexity and were less than 30 m apart. Summer ﬂounder appeared to be important predators in the deeper water river habitats. Our preliminary analyses of coarse scale patterns suggest that predation pressure on juvenile winter ﬂounder may be higher upstream in the river during the post-settlement period. However, analysis of ﬁne scale habitat differences show that shallow water habitats including those that lack structural complexity may serve as critical refugia reducing predator encounter rates in geographic regions where predators and prey overlap.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-19Session IV 3:00 p.m. Use of Video to Assess Juvenile Winter Flounder Densities and Habitats Lesa Meng1, Giancarlo Cicchetti1, and Steve Raciti2 1U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Atlantic Ecology Division Narragansett, RI 02882 2Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 We used a digital video camera mounted to a 1-m beam trawl together with an attached continuous recording YSI sonde and a GPS unit to quantify juvenile winter ﬂounder densities and ﬁsh habitat in Narragansett Bay, RI. The YSI sonde measured temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, depth, turbidity, and chlorophyll a. We hypothesized that human-induced habitat alteration would correlate with a decrease in juvenile winter ﬂounder densities. We sampled true-random points derived from digitization of the entire shoreline of the West Passage and the Providence River. At each random point, the camera/beam trawl/YSI unit was deployed at the water’s edge, then towed out perpendicular to shore for 50-100 m, depending on the amount of macroalgae present. We sampled 80 transects from June-July 2002 and captured 603 ﬁsh representing 23 species. Winter ﬂounder made up 60% of the catch, followed by grubby at 22%. Contrary to our expectations, juvenile winter ﬂounder densities were greater at sites with more anthropogenic inﬂuence. Densities were highest at the head of the bay, near the city of Providence and in other semi-enclosed areas with high chlorophyll a values. When random locations were broken down into eight habitat types (beach, marsh, cobble beach, rip-rap, rock, industrial, marina and macroalgae), densities were highest near rip-rap, industrial areas, and marinas. These areas tended to be near the head of the bay or near harbors with high levels of nutrients and chlorophyll a.

H-20 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Session IV 3:20 p.m. The Genetic Stock Structure of Larval and Juvenile Winter Flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus ) in Connecticut Waters of Eastern Long Island Sound and Estimations of Larval Entrainment Joseph F. Crivello1, Donald J. Danila2, Ernesto Lorda2, Milan Keser2, and Edward F. Roseman2 1University of Connecticut Departments of Physiology and Neurobiology and Marine Sciences Storrs, CT 06269 2Dominion Nuclear Connecticut, Inc. Millstone Environmental Laboratory Waterford, CT 06385 The winter ﬂounder ( Pseudopleuronectes americanus ) is one of a number of coastal American ﬂatﬁsh that face intense ﬁshery pressure and thus has been the focus of management efforts. This species has experienced dramatic declines in abundance over the past three decades with concomitant decreases in commercial and recreational ﬁshing landings. The genetic stock structure of winter ﬂounder larvae in Long Island Sound has not been previously characterized. Stage 1 (yolk-sac) and 2 (pre-ﬂexion) larvae were collected from several locations in Long Island Sound known to be nursery areas for winter ﬂounder in the spring of 2001. The genetic variations among larvae were characterized through the use of 6 microsatellite loci that had been previously reported to be highly polymorphic and heterozygous in winter ﬂounder. The gene frequency differences were used to characterize population structure. Substantial genetic differences were seen among the putative source populations. These genetic differences appeared to be geographically based and provide evidence of genetically distinct spawning populations that appear to be temporally stable. These differences were used to characterize the most likely sources of winter ﬂounder larvae entrained at the Millstone Power Station as well as settled juvenile winter ﬂounder collected in the Niantic River. Samples were classiﬁed to the most likely geographical source population through use of a neural net learning algorithm. A validation of these classiﬁcation results was conducted using a re-sampling scheme based on a bootstrap methodology that led to estimations of the 95% and 99% conﬁdence intervals. These results are discussed in the context of winter ﬂounder management issues.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-21Session IV 3:40 p.m. Formation of Year-class Strength of the Niantic River, CT Winter Flounder Stock -When and Where Variation Occurs and Suggestions on How and Why Donald J. Danila and Edward F. Roseman Dominion Nuclear Connecticut, Inc. Millstone Environmental Laboratory Waterford, CT 06385 Formation of year-class strength in most of the marine ﬁshes largely occurs during the larval and early juvenile stages, yet these phases of life history are often the least understood. Long-term ecological studies of winter ﬂounder conducted at Millstone Power Station in Waterford, CT since the early 1980s have focused on the nearby Niantic River spawning stock and have afforded the means for examining changes in abundance at sequential developmental stages during early life history. Variable annual rates of mortality in early life history can result in large differences in abundance and, hence, in year-class strength at time of recruitment to the spawning stock. Changes in survival and abundance can often vary annually, indicating that complex processes affect recruitment and that these processes may also be different from year to year. From our studies, annual abundance data are available on the adult spawning stock and female egg production during the winter-spring spawning season, larvae of four developmental stages in the Niantic River and Bay during spring, settled age-0 juveniles in the river (and for 5 years in the bay) in summer, and older (ages-0 and 1) juveniles that disperse throughout our study area in fall and winter. We describe these data and note where critical changes in abundance and mortality have occurred during certain periods of early life history. Although our sampling has been relatively consistent for about two decades, allowing good annual comparisons to be made, we have only limited information on processes likely affecting mortality and abundance. Thus, mechanisms that affect survival and recruitment are largely limited to inferences made using results from studies completed elsewhere. However, our considerable information on winter ﬂounder in conjunction with other data gathered during our studies and elsewhere enables us to suggest potential processes that affect the formation of winter ﬂounder year-class strength in southeastern Connecticut.

H-22 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Session V 9:00 a.m. The Smallmouth Flounder, Etropus microstomus , in Narragansett Bay: Looks Like They are Here to Stay Grace Klein-MacPhee1, Aimee Keller1, Dennis Erkan2, and Michael Scherer3 1University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography Narragansett, RI 02882 2Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Division of Fish and Wildlife Marine Fisheries Coastal Fisheries Laboratory Fort Wetherill Rd, Jamestown, RI 02835 3Marine Research Inc. Falmouth, MA 02540 The smallmouth ﬂounder is a small ﬂatﬁsh found in near shore waters and estuaries ranging from Cape Cod to Cape Hatteras. The center of distribution appears to be the Chesapeake Bight, where they are one of the most numerous ﬂatﬁsh species collected in the ichthyoplankton. The eggs and larvae are fairly common off southern New England and Cape Cod, but were rare in Narragansett and Mount Hope Bay. Impingement data from the Brayton Point Power Plant in Mount Hope Bay, Massachusetts shows an increasing upward trend in smallmouth ﬂounder numbers since 1985. Previous ichthyoplankton surveys in Narragansett Bay collected few smallmouth ﬂounder, but a recent survey begun in June 2000 collected relatively large numbers of eggs and larvae. Sampling conducted in 1972-1973 showed no smallmouth ﬂounder eggs and few larvae, but the eggs were not described until 1980. In 1990, no eggs and few larvae were collected. In the 2000 ichthoplankton collection, the eggs comprise 16.5% of the ichthyoplankton and were ranked second in abundance, and the larvae comprised 11%, also second in abundance over the summer and fall seasons. In 2001 and 2002, the smallmouth ﬂounder continues to be a presence, the temporal occurrence is May-October and it is present at all stations in Narragansett Bay.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-23Session V 9:20 a.m. Review of the Ecology of Winter Flounder in Narragansett and Mt. Hope Bays: Why the Decline? Rodney A. Rountree, Brian Rothschild, Lou Goodman, Wendell Brown, Yalin Fan, and Liuzhi Zhao University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, School for Marine Science and Technology New Bedford, MA 02744 Winter ﬂounder abundances have experienced dramatic declines throughout the greater Narragansett Bay estuarine system, including within Mt. Hope Bay and the Sakonnet River. In Mt. Hope Bay in particular, the decline of winter founder has been suggested to be more severe than in other regions and is often attributed to the impact of the Bryton Point Power Plant. The major reason for this assertion is that the decline in Mt. Hope Bay was coincident with a large increase in the power plants cooling water intake and efﬂuent in 1984. We have examined time trends in the abundance of winter ﬂounder and other species from 11 different areas within the Narragansett Bay system based on trawl data collected by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Protection from 1979-2001. Most areas exhibit decline patterns similar to that of Mt. Hope Bay. Mt. Hope Bay declines are not signiﬁcantly greater than other comparable areas, and in fact are less than declines in Greenwich Bay and the Sakonnet River. A further examination of the spatial-temporal patterns in the greater Narragansett Bay reveal that shallow semi-enclosed areas have exhibited the greatest declines and that declines are stronger for juvenile size classes than for adults. These patterns suggest an overall shrinkage of winter ﬂounder’s distribution in the bay. We also examined spatial temporal patterns in the ﬁsh assemblage and ﬁnd that the Narragansett Bay ﬁsh community has undergone a dramatic shift from benthic to pelagic species. This pattern is strongest in the shallow embayments (Greenwich Bay, Sakonnet River, Mt. Hope Bay, Wickford Harbor and upper Narragansett Bay), and weakest in the deep central bay and adjacent Rhode Island Sound areas. These patterns are consistent with community structure changes associated with eutrophication. We suggest that changes in the abundance of winter ﬂounder and ﬁsh species assemblages in Mt. Hope Bay and greater Narragansett Bay over the last 25 years is symptomatic of widespread eutrophication.

H-24 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Session V 9:40 a.m. Sand Shrimp, Crangon septemspinosa , Predation on Juvenile Winter Flounder: Effect of Temperature on Predator Functional Response and Foraging Behavior David L. Taylor University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography Narragansett, RI 02882 Predator-prey dynamics between the sand shrimp, Crangon septemspinosa, and juvenile winter ﬂounder were examined in laboratory experiments to assess the joint effects of varying prey density and temperature on shrimp foraging behavior and mortality of ﬂounder. The functional response of shrimp to six densities of ﬂounder was determined at two temperatures (10 and 16 °C). Moreover, the behavioral mechanisms underlying the shrimp’s functional response (encounters, attacks, captures, and handling time) were quantiﬁed with visual observations and compared to the foraging parameters predicted by continuous-time functional response models. Shrimp consumption rates increased signiﬁcantly with increasing ﬂounder density, irrespective of water temperature. At low ﬂounder densities, however, signiﬁcantly more ﬂounder were consumed at 16 °C then at 10 °C. Analysis of proportional mortality of ﬂounder across prey density revealed a positively density-dependent (sigmoidal) type-III functional response at 10 °C, and an inversely density-dependent (hyperbolic) type-II functional response at 16 °C. Based on model parameter estimates and visual observations of predator foraging behavior, differences in functional responses were attributed to increased shrimp activity (and encounters) at higher ﬂounder densities and temperature. These ﬁndings indicate that shrimp are capable of driving young-of-the-year ﬂounder populations to local extinction during warm water conditions.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-25Session V 10:00 a.m. Can the Predator Pit Hypothesis Explain the Retarded Recovery of Southern New England Winter Flounder Stocks? Saul B. Saila1 and Ernesto Lorda2 1University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography Narragansett, RI 02882 2Dominion Nuclear Connecticut, Inc. Millstone Environmental Laboratory Waterford, CT 06385 A plausible regulatory mechanism, based on predation of early life history stages of the winter ﬂounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus , was developed utilizing a reproduction curve with three equilibrium points. This type of reproduction curve was ﬁrst suggested by Walters (1986), but apparently has not been tested with empirical data to date. We ﬁtted a ﬁve-parameter curve to the relationship between spawning stock size and recruitment to Age 1 which contained three equilibria and which explained more than 80 percent of the variability in the data from the Niantic River, Connecticut. This type of relation can arise when a predator follows a sigmoid functional response in their consumption rates of early life history stages (larvae). If the predator population remains ﬁxed over time, the prey stock may display a stable equilibrium at two stock sizes (S 1 and Sh). The stock size between these two stock sizes (Su) is an unstable level from which the stock will collapse to a lower value or grow towards the high equilibrium value (S h). Following the initial work of Taylor (this conference), the sand shrimp, Crangon septemspinosus , is implicated as a major predator of winter ﬂounder at early life history stages. Using a segmented regression technique, we demonstrate that there is some coherence between the decline of the winter ﬂounder stocks and the relative abundance of predators. We conclude that this work suggests that the predator pit region of the reproduction curve may account for the delayed recovery of southern New England winter ﬂounder stocks.

H-26 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Session VI 10:40 a.m. Winter Flounder Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) Conservation Recommendations Michael Ludwig National Marine Fisheries Service Habitat Conservation Division, Milford, CT 06460 Throughout history, statutory laws have been enacted that unexpectedly create conﬂicts between government agency objectives. Over the last half-century, the conﬂicts between mandates that favor water resource development and environmental protection of those same waters have become evermore contentious. The focusing of legal intent to the point where they can occur, now, within a single agency has facilitated these mission conﬂicts. The passage of supplemental legislation in furtherance of either mandate has narrowed the focus and sharpened the conﬂict with the result that agencies are compelled to act against each other. The conﬂicts between the three resource agencies (US Fish & Wildlife Service [FWS], the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration / National Marine Fisheries Service [NMFS], the US Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) are legendary. Today, as we move into the twenty-ﬁrst century, the conﬂict between improving Port infrastructure by providing adequate access and the need to protect public trust resources living within the same waters has become a national concern. The conﬂict is embodied in time-of-year restrictions on dredging and disposal of sediment. Resolution of the matter is problematic because the objectives cannot be reconciled in mutual mandates or economic frameworks. For example, invocation of a seasonal window to protect aquatic resources may preclude a single, continuous dredging of a desired access channel. Valuation of the dredging and cost delays is possible, but valuing aquatic resource impacts is not an equally well-grounded practice. Because winter ﬂounder are unique in their spawning and early life stage characteristics, they tend to engender agency conﬂict and special note in EFH Conservation Recommendations. Through a series of serendipitous and focused investigations NMFS has come to be the source of much of the controversy. Species sensitivity, spawning concentration identiﬁcation, and early life stage movements are the issues that have come to be the basis for negotiating resource protective objectives under the EFH program. Local knowledge of these matters is vital as are the advances made in dredging and our understanding of the impacts associated with it. Much of this interplay has taken place in the waters off the New England coastline. Today, NMFS routinely invokes seasonal constraints on any activities that might diminish winter ﬂounder EFH from January to June.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-27Session VI 11:00 a.m. Genetic Stock Identiﬁcation and Mass-balance Modeling Determine Contribution of Niantic River Winter Flounder Larvae to Power Plant Entrainment Edward F. Roseman1, Donald J. Danila1, Ernesto Lorda1, and Joseph Crivello2 1Dominion Nuclear Connecticut, Inc. Millstone Environmental Laboratory Waterford, CT 06385 2University of Connecticut Departments of Physiology and Neurobiology and Marine Sciences Storrs, CT 06269 Catch-per-unit-effort of winter ﬂounder in assessment trawl surveys conducted in the Niantic River, CT has declined since the early 1980’s. While the causes of this decline are speculative, the magnitude of the impact of entrainment by Millstone Power Station (MPS) on the Niantic River stock depends upon how many larvae originated from the Niantic River. Hydrodynamic modeling and tidal current drogue studies conducted in the 1970s and 1990s showed that much of the water entering MPS comes from Long Island Sound. Other winter ﬂounder stocks are known to spawn east and west of the Niantic River and tidal studies indicated that winter ﬂounder larvae from those sites entered Niantic Bay from Long Island Sound. In our study, mass-balance calculations were used to investigate whether the number of larvae entering Niantic Bay from the Niantic River could sustain the number of larvae observed in the bay during the period from 1984 through 2001. Further, we estimated the number of entrained winter ﬂounder larvae originating from the Niantic River and compared these results with estimates derived from genetic stock analysis performed in 2001. The lowest percent entrainment attributed to the Niantic River winter ﬂounder stock was observed in 1997, with 12.3% of 9.3 million larvae entrained originating from the Niantic River. The highest percent entrainment attributed to the Niantic River stock occurred in 1996, when 58.8% of the 30.4 million entrained larvae were determined to be of Niantic River origin. In 2001, mass-balance calculations and genetic stock analysis provided similar results, determining that 21.4% and 22%, respectfully, of the 80.7 million larvae entrained were of Niantic River origin. Both methods showed that peak fractional entrainment of Niantic River larvae occurred early in the spring. Together, these studies provide a validated characterization of the sources of winter ﬂounder larvae entrained at MPS.

Nothing is known regarding the abundance, biology, and production rates of these ﬁsh or their afﬁliation to witch ﬂounder in shallower shelf waters. Recent opportunistic sampling at depths ranging from 367-914 meters has provided a limited number of samples for the preliminary estimation of growth and maturation rates. When compared to witch ﬂounder of the shallower regions of the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank, growth rates for deep-water ﬁsh were considerably lower and maturation occurs at a greater age. Differences in otolith morphology and length-weight relationships were also observed. Possible linkages of these deep-water witch ﬂounder to other populations in the Northwest Atlantic are hypothesized.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-29Session VI 11:40 a.m. Culture of Atlantic Halibut ( Hippoglossus hippoglossus ) in Offshore Net Pens W. Huntting Howell, Michael Chambers, and Nathan Rennels University of New Hampshire Department of Zoology Durham, NH 03824 The University of New Hampshire’s Open Ocean Aquaculture Demonstration Project seeks to stimulate the development of commercial aquaculture in New England. Among the ﬁnﬁsh species we have been working with, Atlantic halibut were selected because of their high market value and demand, tolerance to cold water, good growth rates and feed conversion ratios, disease resistance, and reduced availability from the wild ﬁshery. In May of 2001, 2000 juvenile halibut (30 g mean weight) were purchased from R&R Development Ltd. in Digby, Nova Scotia, and transferred to the UNH Coastal Marine Lab in New Castle, NH. Here, the ﬁsh were cultured to 100 g mean weight in a ﬂow through seawater system. In October of 2001, the halibut were transferred to a 600 m 3 Sea Station cage located 14 km offshore in 52 m water depth. The cage was submerged 12 m below the ocean surface for grow-out. Fish have been fed (Shur GainTM halibut diet) once per day at a rate of 3-4% body weight. Fish are being sampled once per month for survival, weight, and total length. Survival has been excellent (>90%), and the current average weight of the ﬁsh is 456g. We expect to harvest them when they reach 1-2 kg, which should occur in the summer of 2003. The only difﬁculty we have encountered has been with fat cell necrosis syndrome (“sunburn”) in some mal-pigmented ﬁsh maintained in a surface cage. Information gained from this initial growout experiment will hopefully further the development of halibut culture in New England.

H-32 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Squamation, Pigmentation, and Asymmetry in Summer Flounder David M. Boynton and Jessica A. Bolker University of New Hampshire Department of Zoology Institute for the Development and Evolution of Wet Animals Durham, NH 03824 Flatﬁshes, such as the summer ﬂounder ( Paralichthys dentatus ), provide unique opportunities to study the development of morphological asymmetry. We have examined left/right differences in squamation and pigmentation throughout early development in P . dentatus , documenting scale development and location in relation to age, size, and overall pigmentation pattern (normal, albino, or ambicolored). General patterns of scale development in P . dentatus resemble those in Japanese ﬂounder ( P . olivaceus ; Seikai, 1980). In both species, scale development progresses from posterior to anterior, and from the center of each side out toward the dorsal and ventral margins, with squamation more advanced on the ocular side than on the blind. In malpigmented summer and Japanese ﬂounder, pigmentation is associated with the degree of ctenoid scale development: dark pigmentation correlates with the presence of ctenii. Kikuchi and Makino (1990) noted that in ambicolored Japanese ﬂounder ( i.e., those with a partially dark blind side), pigmentation and ctenoid scales appear to “wrap” around the dorsal and ventral margins from the ocular to the blind side. We see the same pattern in ambicolored summer ﬂounder. The association of scale type with pigmentation – ctenoid scales in dark areas of skin, and cycloid scales in light areas – appears essentially the same in summer as in Japanese ﬂounder. However, our observations of radii, in all summer ﬂounder scales we have examined, suggest that tentatively identiﬁed “cycloid” scales may actually represent primary (incompletely developed) ctenoid scales. This raises the question of whether there are any true cycloid scales in juveniles of this species.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-33The California Halibut as an Aquaculture Candidate: A Comparison to Other Flatﬁsh Douglas E. Conklin1, Raul H. Piedrahita2, Jean-Benoit Muguet1, German E. Merino2, 3, and Margarita Cervantes-Trujano1, 2 1University of California, Department of Animal Science, Davis, CA 95616 2University of California, Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Davis, CA 95616 3Departamento de Acuicultura, Universidad Catolica del Norte, Coquimbo, Chile Research into the culture of the California halibut, Paralichthys californicus, is comparatively new but has the advantage of building on information gathered for other ﬂatﬁsh aquaculture candidates. This presentation compares what information is available for the California halibut to that for other ﬂatﬁsh species. As with other ﬂatﬁsh, a combination of rotifers followed by enriched brine shrimp nauplii and some formulated feed were initially used for rearing California halibut larvae. The employment of a static green-water type system in the second season of research dramatically increased the numbers of larvae brought through metamorphosis. Substantial improvements in weaning were also made during the second year of the project in which weaning was achieved as early as 42 days, compared to over 100 days in the ﬁrst year. The characteristic morphology and behavior of metamorphosed ﬂatﬁsh offer a number of advantages to culturists. All the ﬂatﬁsh being considered for culture are temperate species but increases in growth rate are noted with limited increases in temperature. A summary of growth rates (Speciﬁc growth rate; SGR, %/day) for a number of ﬂatﬁsh species with notes on culture conditions and feed is presented. Work to date with the various ﬂatﬁsh species suggests, as with other marine species, a high requirement for dietary protein. Although lipid requirements have yet to be deﬁned it is thought they will most easily be satisﬁed through the use of marine lipids. Conversely, meeting these requirements for protein and marine lipids undoubtedly will be expensive. Fortunately, in that these ﬁsh spend much of their time lying motionless on the bottom, food conversion should be particularly attractive. In addition, provision of inputs such as oxygen and removal of wastes should be less of a challenge that for actively swimming species. It appears that culture density of ﬂatﬁsh, as deﬁned by coverage of the tank bottom, can be surprisingly high. Some species have been grown at densities over 100%, which necessitates the ﬁsh stack on top of each other. One other particularly interesting component of ﬂatﬁsh culture is the potential for various ﬂatﬁsh to be cultured in an environment of reduced salinity. This could allow culturists to move away from expensive coastal sites. Information available with regard to growth and survival of various ﬂatﬁsh species under reduced salinity conditions is summarized. While we are still in the process of researching many of the above culture components, work to date suggests that the California halibut has the potential to become one of a number of ﬂatﬁsh species that will be commercially cultured in the future.

H-34 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Initial Evidence of Vertical Migration of Winter Flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus ) in a New Jersey USA Estuary Mary Carla Curran1, Robert J. Chant2, Kenneth W. Able3, and Scott M. Glenn2 1Savannah State University, Marine Science Program Savannah, GA 31404 2Rutgers University, Institute of Marine and Coastal Studies New Brunswick, NJ 08903 3Rutgers University, Marine Field Station Institute of Marine and Coastal Studies Tuckerton, NJ 08087 Our prior research indicated that coves near Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey are settlement areas for winter ﬂounder ( Pseudopleuronectes americanus ), and that estuarine circulation patterns in this ﬂood- dominated system supported the advection of larvae into these coves. The purpose of the present study was to determine the vertical distribution of larvae. We performed both surface and bottom plankton tows (bongo nets) synchronously with repeated Acoustic Doppler Current Proﬁler (ADCP) transects over the study area. Despite tidal currents approaching 2 m/s, our observations indicate that the temporal variability of larval abundances cannot be explained solely on horizontal advection. On average, more larvae (42-489.8/1000m 3) were collected at the bottom than at the surface (0-233.0/1000m3). We always collected larvae at the bottom, but collected no larvae at the surface 31% of the time. These results, in conjunction with results from simultaneous 1-m plankton tows, indicate the importance of behavior in the advection of these larvae into settlement coves. Larvae that migrate to the bottom of the channel during the ebb may avoid being swept out the inlet and instead may move to the surface during the subsequent ﬂood to ﬁnd suitable settlement habitat within the estuary.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-35The Contribution of Southern Flounder and Summer Flounder to the Recreational Fishery of the Southeastern USA Mary Carla Curran and Donna E. McDowell Savannah State University Marine Science Program Savannah, GA 31404 The Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) program of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is a national program designed to estimate marine recreational ﬁnﬁsh total catch, and angler effort and participation. It consists of a voluntary intercept survey of ﬁshermen upon completion of their ﬁshing trip and provides information on species catch and associated lengths and weights. The purpose of the present study is to demonstrate the value of the MRFSS program in providing important data to ﬁsheries biologists despite the relatively small number of ﬁshes collected. Between 1997 and 2001, the combined catch of the summer ﬂounder, Paralichthys dentatus , and the southern ﬂounder, Paralichthys lethostigma, contributed up to 8% of the recreational total catch in North Carolina, 8.1% in South Carolina, 2.9% in Georgia, and 4% in eastern Florida. However, North Carolina was the only state in which summer ﬂounder dominated the ﬂounder catch. The contribution of ﬂounder ranged from a low of 1.3% (GA, 1997) to a high of 8.1% (SC, 2000). In 1998, a 12-inch size restriction was placed on ﬂounder and we investigated the impact of this regulation. Using only data provided by DNR in Georgia for southern ﬂounder, there was a signiﬁcant difference in the ﬁsh sizes collected over the years. In 1997, 42% of the ﬁsh were under 12 inches, but only 10% were undersized in 2001. This encouraging news indicates that recreational ﬁsherman seem to follow guidelines regarding size restrictions.

H-36 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Mortality of YOY Winter Flounder Held on Newark Bay Sediment: Some Unplanned Observations Andrew F. J. Draxler and Kristina M. Salvati National Marine Fisheries Service Northeast Fisheries Science Center James J. Howard Marine Sciences Laboratory Highlands, NJ 07732 Young of the year winter ﬂounder ( Pseudopleuronectes americanus ) from Sandy Hook Bay suffered unexpectedly high mortality (45% in seven days) when held on sediments from a shallow area (0.5 m MLW) of Newark Bay off Bayonne NJ. Fish were randomly allocated to tanks containing either clean sand or Newark Bay sediment for the purpose of generating treatment and control animals to competitive predation experiments. Tanks were well ﬂushed resulting in a maximum dissolved oxygen concentration gradient of less than 6 μ M (0.2 mg/L) from inlet to outlet. Mortality was minimal among controls on clean sand, but in the tank containing Newark Bay sediment some ﬁsh were found dead on top of sediment and many more had died while buried, suggesting the latter had not made an effort to escape the lethal conditions. The shallow depth (3 cm) of sediment employed and the measures taken to preclude hypoxia in the water suggest that constituents of Newark Bay sediment other than biogeochemicals were responsible for the mortality.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-37Abundance, Distribution, and Condition of Hogchokers (Trinectes maculatus ) in the Hudson River Estuary, April – September 2002 Ivan Ferron and Chris Chambers National Marine Fisheries Service Northeast Fisheries Science Center James J. Howard Marine Sciences Laboratory Highlands, NJ 07732 Hogchokers ( Trinectes maculatus ) are an abundant component of estuarine systems in the mid- Atlantic Bight. Despite their abundance, little is known about hogchoker biology and their trophic role in general. This study was undertaken to provide new information on aspects of abundance, movement, growth, and reproduction of hogchokers in the Hudson River estuary. Hogchokers were collected during monthly bottom trawl surveys of the Lower Hudson River estuary during the spring through autumn of 2002. Fish were collected during 5-minute tows of two otter trawl sets at each of 10 stations spanning from lower Manhattan (Battery) to Newburgh, New York. Abundances and location of captured young-of-the-year, older juveniles and adults were recorded. These ﬁsh were processed at the laboratory for body length and weight, gender, and liver and gonad weights. The liver and gonadal weights were used to compute hepatic-somatic and gonadal-somatic indices, respectively, in order to identify spawning time and to deﬁne the role that the liver might play in ﬁsh condition and reproductive effort. Results of this study will be compared with earlier results from the Hudson River and Delaware Bay.

H-38 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Temporal Changes in Behavior of the Blackcheek Tongueﬁsh, Symphurus plagiusa Jody L. Frost and Mary Carla Curran Savannah State University, Marine Science Program Savannah, GA 31404 Blackcheek tongueﬁsh, S. plagiusa , are abundant in shallow coastal waters and have insigniﬁcant value as a sport ﬁsh or for the commercial ﬁshing industry. In order to assess the behavioral patterns of one of the least understood ﬂatﬁshes, observations were performed over a 48-h period in a controlled environment. Individuals were caught via trawl, measured, and randomly placed in separate experimental chambers (84 x 43 x 34 cm) within 36 h of capture. Chambers contained 1 cm of clean graded sand and 10 cm of water (30 oC and 29 ppt at start of experiment). To determine if any diel or tidal rhythmicity existed, ﬁsh were observed in approximate 3-h intervals in correspondence with high, ebb, low, and ﬂood tide. A light with a red ﬁlter was used at night to minimize disturbance. Diel activity was quantiﬁed by noting the percent of the tongueﬁsh body covered by sediment. That, in conjunction with data regarding whether individuals changed orientation or changed location, was utilized to determine activity patterns. Preliminary results suggest that blackcheek tongueﬁsh were more active at night as indicated by less sediment coverage and the fact that ﬁsh changed location frequently. Future studies will focus on whether interaction between tidal stage and light level affects tongueﬁsh movement patterns.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-39Site Fidelity Patterns of Sub-legal Summer Flounder in Virginia Waters from Angler-assisted Tagging Program Data, 2000-2002 Jon A. Lucy1 and Claude M. Bain, III2 1Virginia Sea Grant Marine Advisory Program Virginia Institute of Marine Science College of William and Mary Gloucester Pt., VA 23062 2Virginia Saltwater Fishing Tournament Virginia Marine Resources Commission Virginia Beach, VA 23451 Summer ﬂounder, Paralychthys dentatus , ranks among the top ﬁnﬁsh landed in both Virginia’s commercial and recreational ﬁsheries. Under the Summer Flounder Fishery Management Plan, incremental increases of recreational ﬁshery minimum size limits in 2002 to 394 mm TL (V A’s coastal ﬁshery) and 444 mm TL (V A’s Chesapeake Bay ﬁshery), coupled with angler bag limits and 1-2 week mid-summer ﬁshery closures, are contributing to rebuilding of the stock. Requiring anglers to release greater proportions of their catches also provided an opportunity to learn more about the distribution and habitat use patterns of 1-3 year old ﬂounder through the Virginia Game Fish Tagging Program (VGFTP). Beginning in 2000 the VGFTP has tagged over 10,800 juvenile ﬂounder (through July 2002; ﬁsh typically 279-381 mm TL). Approximately 900 recaptures have been reported (8 % return rate). Fish are tagged in the caudal peduncle musculature with a Hallprint T-bar tag (anchor-10-mm long; sheath 65-mm long), a tag having approximately100% retention and producing no signiﬁcant tagging mortality (from 3-10 day cage trials with tagged ﬁsh). Most tagging, and subsequent recaptures, occurred at ﬁshing piers, bridge-tunnel complexes, and jetties. At several locations in 2001, 7-15 multiple recaptures (2-5 recaptures of the same tagged ﬁsh) provided unique data showing that some ﬁsh remained in the vicinity of certain structure sites over signiﬁcant periods of time, i.e., May through July/August and September-November. For example, a ﬁsh was recaptured on three separate occasions at the same pier between June and August (serial periods at large of 32/44/and 67 days); similarly, a ﬁsh recaptured ﬁve times at the same pier demonstrated site ﬁdelity over serial periods of 12/13/50/58/and 74 days. At another pier a tagged ﬁsh was recaptured three times at the site during September-November (serial periods of 2/19/and 64 days). Recaptures of ﬁsh tagged during one year and recaptured the next year also demonstrate some occurrences of year-to-year site ﬁdelity, both for sites in lower Chesapeake Bay as well as sites around ocean inlets. Short and long distance movements of ﬂounder have also been demonstrated. Recaptures of ﬂounder tagged at the Chesapeake Bay mouth have occurred from off Cape May (NJ), Long Island Sound (NY), North Carolina, and South Carolina beaches, a general pattern observed in earlier VIMS studies (1987-89 and 1995-96).

H-40 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Embryonic and Larval Staging of Summer Flounder, Paralichthys dentatus * Gabriela M. Martinez and Jessica A. Bolker University of New Hampshire Department of Zoology Institute for the Development and Evolution of Wet Animals Durham, NH 03824 Summer ﬂounder, Paralichthys dentatus , is an increasingly important aquaculture species in the U.S. Like most other marine ﬁshes, however, its early development is poorly known, mainly due to the historical difﬁculty of obtaining pelagic embryonic and larval stages. The cooperation of a commercial hatchery has enabled us to prepare a detailed staging table for embryonic and larval development using large numbers of embryos of known ages reared under controlled conditions. Our staging scheme is designed to facilitate rapid assessment of developmental stage based on readily visible landmark features, while providing more detailed descriptions of the morphological differentiation of the jaw apparatus and digestive system. We divide development into two main periods, pre-hatching and post-hatching, each of which is further subdivided into discrete morphological stages. Pre-hatching stages (fertilization to hatching) are based loosely on Shardo’s (1995) staging table for Alosa sapidissima ; post-hatching stages (hatching to metamorphosis) are aligned with the staging table for Japanese ﬂounder ( Paralichthys olivaceus ; Minami, 1982; Fukuhara, 1986). The appearance and increasing complexity of discrete morphological features provides a more reliable and less variable measure of development than do simple scalar measures such as length, width or age. This staging scheme should therefore facilitate accurate assessments of developmental stage, which are important both for a wide range of applied studies (for example on larval nutrition), and for basic descriptive and experimental research in this species. ___________________________________________________ *Supported by a grant from the Hubbard Marine Research Initiation and Infrastructure Program to JAB.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-41Seasonal Changes in Blood Chemistry of the Yellowtail Flounder, Limanda ferruginea Renee Mercaldo-Allen, Margaret A. Dawson, Diane Kapareiko, and Catherine A. Kuropat National Marine Fisheries Service Northeast Fisheries Science Center Milford Laboratory, Milford, CT 06460 Seasonal changes in blood chemistry and hematology were observed in yellowtail ﬂounder, Limanda ferruginea , collected from the Northwest Atlantic. Variations in blood parameters appear to be regulated by seasonally-induced physiological and/or environmental factors. Plama osmolalities during the winter, spring and summer seasons were signiﬁcantly greater than in the fall. Sodium concentrations peaked during the winter and declined during spring and fall. Potassium was highest in the summer and lowest during the winter. Calcium was signiﬁcantly higher in fall than spring. Hematocrit was highest in the spring and lowest during the fall. Hemoglobin values were elevated during the winter and spring months and declined during the fall. This baseline collection of blood data may be useful in monitoring the health and condition of yellowtail ﬂounder in nature or under aquaculture conditions.

H-42 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Winter Flounder Stock Enhancement Ben Morgan1 and Michael D. Scherer2 1Llennoco, Inc. Chatham, MA 02633 2Marine Research, Inc. Falmouth, MA 02540 The decline of traditional ground ﬁsheries gives urgency to aiding the crisis by augmenting indigenous populations with hatchery-reared ﬁsh. Winter ﬂounder ( Pleuronectes americanus ) may be an excellent candidate for stock enhancement. From 1997 to the present, Llennoco, Inc. has been successfully spawning adult winter ﬂounder, growing out juveniles and tagging winter ﬂounder for stock enhancement. From 2000 to the present, Marine Research, Inc. has successfully transported, released and recaptured those hatchery-reared ﬁsh. Issues have been addressed and obstacles overcome in the process, particularly in the areas of maintaining broodstock, life support systems, food supply and distribution, monitoring systems, transportation methods, tagging, release and recapture. The hatchery methods utilized by Llennoco, Inc. have proven that it is economically and biologically feasible to produce millions of juvenile winter ﬂounder at a reasonable cost. The procedures developed by Marine Research, Inc. have shown that the hatchery-reared winter ﬂounder do survive following release in Plymouth and Duxbury Harbors. Recaptured individuals obtained by beach seine as much as 95 days post-release showed good growth rates and cage studies suggested that survival rates may be equal between tagged hatchery-reared ﬁsh and naturally occurring ﬁsh. Stomach content analyses showed that the diets of released hatchery-reared ﬁsh and wild ﬁsh were identical. As a result of these efforts, it appears that winter ﬂounder may be used for large-scale enhancement program.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-43Winter Flounder ( Pseudopleuronectes americanus ) Spawning Areas in New Haven Harbor Jose J. Pereira, Ronald Goldberg, and Paul Clark National Marine Fisheries Service Northeast Fisheries Science Center Milford Laboratory, Milford, CT 06460 As part of a previous study in 1994, 24 gravid female winter ﬂounder were ﬁtted with acoustic transmitters and released in New Haven Harbor, CT prior to the spawning season. The transmitters sent out a unique numerical signal so that individual ﬁsh could be identiﬁed. We visited the harbor weekly during spawning season and systematically searched the harbor for tagged ﬁsh using a directional hydrophone. Areas where ﬁsh were found were thought to be potential spawning areas. Fish were frequently located in Morris Cove on the eastern side of the harbor and around the east breakwater. Using a benthic sled, we then sampled these areas in an effort to collect fertilized winter ﬂounder eggs and to conﬁrm the presence of spawning activity at the site. Since only a few winter ﬂounder eggs were collected in 1994, the same six sampling sites were sampled more intensively in 1997. Triplicate tows were conducted at each site approximately biweekly from February to the beginning of April. In 1999, four sites in the shallower areas of Morris Cove were sampled using the same protocol as for the six sites sampled in 1997. In total, over 1400 eggs were collected, 115 of which were winter ﬂounder eggs. The greatest number of winter ﬂounder eggs was collected in mid-March in both years. The observed distribution of winter ﬂounder eggs indicates that the northern end of Morris Cove and the area adjacent to it and east of the main channel are spawning areas for winter ﬂounder.

H-44 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002The Feeding Behavior of Atlantic Halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus Gwynne Schnaittacher and David Berlinsky University of New Hampshire Department of Zoology Durham, NH 03824 Atlantic halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus , is currently being explored as an aquaculture candidate in coastal waters of northern New England. To gain a better understanding of the feeding requirements of this species, the following experiments were conducted. The ﬁrst experiment examined the effect of feeding frequency on growth, feed consumption and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Juvenile ﬁsh (20g; 20/tank) were reared at 13ºC in 140 l tanks in a closed recirculating system (n=three replicates/treatment) over an 84-day period. The ﬁsh were fed one, three and ﬁves times daily over a 12-hour period under constant lighting. A signiﬁcant difference in growth was observed between ﬁsh fed one and ﬁve times daily (p< 0.05). Fish fed once daily consumed signiﬁcantly less feed during this study (731.7g) than those fed three or ﬁve times daily (856.3g and 888.7g, respectively). There was no signiﬁcant difference in feed conversion ratio (FCR) among treatment groups. A second experiment was conducted to determine if Atlantic halibut exhibit an increase in swimming activity prior to a scheduled feeding (Feeding Anticipatory Activity; FAA). The activity of the ﬁsh (n=10/group), entrained to one feeding per day, was monitored by video for 72-h periods. Video recordings of ﬁsh movement were digitized and converted to histograms for statistical analysis. Preliminary analysis did not conﬁrm the existence of FAA under these experimental conditions. Additional feeding experiments are currently in progress.

Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002 H-45Histological and Biochemical Comparison of Skin Development in Normal and Malpigmented Summer Flounder* Amy Van Cise, Tanya F. Hakala, and Jessica A. Bolker University of New Hampshire Department of Zoology Institute for the Development and Evolution of Wet Animals Durham, NH 03824 We have applied two complementary techniques to document skin and pigmentation development in summer ﬂounder: parafﬁn histology, which shows both general skin structure and the speciﬁc location of melanophores, and a biochemical (DOPA) assay that reveals melanophores at early stages of their differentiation. In newly-hatched larvae (stage A; Martinez and Bolker, 2002), the skin is not yet divided into distinct dermal and epidermal layers; this morphological distinction begins to appear at stage C, and is well developed by the onset of metamorphosis (stage F). No early melanophores are detectable by the DOPA assay at stage A, but scattered cells on both ocular and blind sides show a positive DOPA reaction by stage E (late premetamorphosis); this pattern continues through stage H (late metamorphosis). No DOPA-reactive cells are detectable at later stages. In metamorphosed larvae 50 days after hatching, a layer of melanin is present between the dermal and epidermal layers of ocular-side skin, but absent on the blind side. Scales and scale pockets, which extend deeply into the dermis, begin to develop by 75 days after hatching; melanin is localized mainly at the base of the epidermis on the ocular side. In juveniles (>60 mm), dermal melanophores gradually replace epidermal melanin as the primary basis of dark pigmentation on the ocular side, though some extracellular melanin remains in the epidermis. Malpigmented juveniles display the same skin structure and melanin distribution as normal individuals at the histological level; however, albino ﬁsh show typical blind-side morphology in ocular-side skin, and ambicolored ﬁsh have ocular-type skin and pigmentation on both sides of the body. ___________________________________________________ *Supported by UNH-AES Hatch Grant 399 and USDA NRI 99-35208-8586 to JAB.

H-46 Flatﬁsh Biology Conference 2002Skeletal Anomalies in Offshore Species of Flatﬁsh, American Plaice: A Comparison with Winter Flounder John Ziskowski National Marine Fisheries Service Northeast Fisheries Science Center Milford Laboratory, Milford, CT 06460 American plaice are a good choice as a sentinel species for habitat monitoring in the Gulf of Maine and Massachusetts Bay. They are widely distributed in deep water, their population is relatively stable, and they are susceptible to axial skeletal deformities which are readily imaged through X-ray analysis. Since 1992, plaice have been regularly collected on NEFSC groundﬁsh cruises and brought to the Milford Laboratory for X-ray analysis where nine types of deformities have been documented: fusion of individual centra, complexed- vertebrae which have incompletely separated during embryogenesis, accessory processes, deformed centra, reduced centra, spinal curvature, reduced processes, and hyper-ossiﬁcation. X-ray analysis of a sample of 66 plaice collected in Massachusetts Bay near the Boston Efﬂuent Outfall in spring 2002 revealed that 11 of 66 ﬁsh (16.6%) had vertebral deformities; the most common were fusion and complexed-vertebrae, which affected 7 of 11 ﬁsh. Eight of the 11 deformed plaice had evidence of hyper-ossiﬁcation. Prevalence of deformities in the 2002 sample was compared with a similar sample collected during the fall of 1994 from Massachusetts Bay. It was also compared with axial skeletal deformities found on winter ﬂounder from Boston Harbor and Georges Bank, collected during the period 1989-1995.
