The sponsor has provided evidence from two completed clinical studies in support of the efficacy and safety of Ex elon® for the proposed new indication. These are:  Study 2311, which was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-arm in design  Study 2311E1, the open-label uncontrolled extension to Study 2311 In addition, the sponsor has performed a non-interventional study (Study 2314) of the validity of a number of assessment scales in the Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (and vascular dementia); parti al results for this study have been submitted in this application. The data for these studies as they pertain to the efficacy and safety of Exelon® in this population are summarized below, as are the results of the non- interventional validation study listed above. Efficacy The results of a single randomized, double- blind, placebo-cont rolled study (also referred to as the EXPRESS Study) of the efficacy of rivastigmine in the proposed entity of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease (also referred to interchangeably as Parkinson’s Dis ease Dementia) have been submitted in this application. The main features of this study were as follows  This was a randomized (2:1 [Exelon®:Placebo]), double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel-arm study  The key inclusion criteria for the study were as follows

Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 Cog (difference in mean change from baseline score at endpoint: 2.90; p < 001) and ADCS-CGIC (difference in mean score between treatment groups at endpoint: 0.5; p = 0.007). Note that an Agency statistical reviewer has judged the distribution of ADAS-Cog data not to be normal and therefore in violation of the assumptions of the analysis of covariance model proposed; however, even with the use of a non-parametric model, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, the Exelon® group showed a statistically significant superiority over placebo on this measure  Nominally statistically significant differences were seen between the treatment groups on all secondary efficacy variables at Week 24 in the same dataset as that used for the primary efficacy analysis  Analyses of the primary efficacy parameters using other datasets (intent-to-treat last-observation-carried-forward, and observed cases) yielded similar results. Safety Study 2311 This study has already been summarized abov e. Salient safety findings for this study were as follows.  The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and tremor was appreciably higher in the rivastigmine group than in the placebo group; a similar adverse event profile was seen in the key controlled clinical tria ls of Exelon® in Alzheimer’s Disease  Several treatment-emergent adverse events that may have represented a worsening in the motor manifestations of Parkinson’s Disease, and tremor in particular, were more frequent in those treated with Exelon® than in those treated with placebo. However, changes in UPDRS total and individual motor scores, probably a more objective measure of change in the motor manifestations of Parkinson’s Disease than the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, showed no meaningful difference between treatment groups. Study 2311E1 This was a 24-week open-label uncontro lled extension to Study 2311 intended primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Exelon® in the study population. Patients given the option of enrolling in this study had either completed the double-blind treatment phas e of Study 2311 or discontinued early during that study, but returned for all the remaining scheduled efficacy assessments without significant protocol vi olations. Regardless of their previous treatment assignment, patients enrolled in th e extension study were all re-titrated to a flexible dose of Exelon® that ranged from 1.5 mg BID to 6.0 mg BID, based on tolerability. 433 patients enrolled in Study 2311 were eligible to enroll in Study 2311E1, of whom 334 patients actually consented to participate in, and 273 patients, completed the latter study.

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 The adverse event profile of Exelon® in Study 2311 was broadly similar to that seen in Study 2311E1. Non-Interventional Vali dation Study (Study 2314) This 4-week cross-sectional study wa s intended to evaluate the validity and reliability of several measures of cognition , activities of daily living, executive function and behavior in patients with Parkinson’s Disease Dementia and vascular dementia, and to compare the per formance of the same measures in those conditions with their performance in Alzheimer’s Disease. This submission contains an interim report that only per tains to Parkinson’s Disease Dementia. The interim report indicates that 55 pati ents with Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (diagnosed using the DSM-IV criteria) and 58 patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (diagnosed using the NINCDS- ADRDA criteria) were enr olled in the study; patients with each diagnosis were fu rther grouped into mild and moderate categories based on Mini-Mental Status Examination scores of 18 to 24 and 10 to 17, respectively, at st udy entry. The efficacy inst ruments evaluated were the ADAS-Cog, Global Deterioration Scale, ADCS-ADL, D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Test, Ten-Point Clock Test, Trailmaking Tests A and B, Neuropsychiatry Inventory, including Neuropsychiatry In ventory-Distress, and Cognitive Drug Research Computerized Assessment System tests for the assessment of attention. Each enrolled patient was to be evaluated using these measures at baseline and Week 4; a ll but 2 patients, both in the Parkinson’s Disease Dementia group, complet ed their evaluations. The results of this study have been inte rpreted as demonstrating the following:  That the ADAS-Cog score can differentiate between dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease of mild and moderate severities, as can the scores for several of the other instruments evaluated in this study  That the ADAS-Cog and several other efficacy measures had test-retest reliability in dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease  That the ADAS-Cog scores correlated with those of several other efficacy instruments in dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease, whether the latter measures assessed cognition or other domains  A factor analysis that compared populations with Parkinson’s Disease Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease on ADAS-Cog sub-item scores had indicated that the sub-items grouped differently in each population, suggesting that the cognitive and behavioral profiles in these populations might differ Conclusions Deferred, pending discussion of this appl ication at a scheduled meeting of the Peripheral and Central Nervous Systems Drugs Advisory Committee

Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 2 DSM-IV Criteria For Deme ntia Due To Parkinson’s Disease 1 Dementia Due To Parkinson’s Disease The essential feature of Dementia Due To Parkinson’s Disease is the presence of dementia that is judged to be of direct pathophysiological consequence of Parkinson’s dise ase. Parkinson’s disease is a slowly progressive neurological condition, characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Dementia has been reported to occur in approximately 20%-60% of individuals with Parkinson’s disease and is more likely to be present in older individuals or in those with more severe or advanc ed disease. The dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease is characterized by cognitive and moto r slowing, executive dysfunction and impairment in memory retrieval. Declining cognitive performance in individuals with Parkinson’s disease is frequently exacerbated by depression. Findings on physical examination include the characteristic abnormal motor signs of resting tremor, evidence of slowness and poverty of movement (such as micrographia), or muscular rigidity and loss of associated movements. At autopsy, neuronal loss and Lewy bodies are evident in the substantia ni gra. There are a number of syndromes that manifest with dementia, Parkinsonian movement disorders, and additional neurological features (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy, olivopontocerebellar degeneration, and Vascular Dementia). Some individuals with Parkinson’s disease and dementia are found at autopsy to have coexisting neuropathology indicative of Alzheimer’s disease or of diffuse Lewy body disease. Efficacy Outcome Measur es And Selected Additional Instruments Used In Efficacy Study These instruments are outlined below: 1 Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (ADAS- Cog) This is a validated instrument consisti ng of the following 11 items: Word Recall Task, Naming Fingers and Objects, Orientation Questions, Constructional Praxis Task, Following Commands, Ideational Pr axis Task, Word Recognition Task, Rating of Spoken Language, Rating of Language Comprehension, Rating of Word Finding Difficulty and Rating of Ability to Recall Test Instructions. The total scores range from 0-70 with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. 2 Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Clinician’s Global Impression Of Change (ADCS-CGIC) This instrument provides for a rating of overall (global) change from baseline by an independent clinician experienced in the assessment of patients with dementia. The term “independent” implies that the rater is not to be involved in any additional manner in the evaluation and/ or treatment of patients enrolled in this study Assessments will be performed at baseli ne and at subsequent visits. It is recommended that the baseline interview be conducted by 2 independent raters, one designated as the primary rater and t he other as a backup. Post-baseline ratings are to be conducted solely by the pr imary rater or, in his/her absence, by the back-up rater.

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 At baseline both raters will have access to all of the patients’ available records and evaluations. At all subsequent visits, t he rater is to rely (for baseline data) solely upon information obtained during t he baseline assessment of the patient and caregiver by that rater (including written notes and, if available, the baseline interview audiotape or videotape). At post-baseline visits, data obtained directly from the patient may be supplemented by that obtained from the caregiver. The rater will not have access to other safety or efficacy data, including all previous post-baseline ADCS-CGIC ratings by either rater. A standard 7-point categorical rating scale and its dichotomized version will both be used for rating and are further described below: • The 7-point categorical scale is as follows: Change Rating Marked improvement 1 Moderate improvement 2 Minimal improvement 3 No change 4 Minimal worsening 5 Moderate worsening 6 Marked worsening 7 • The dichotomized version of the 7-point categorical scale is derived as follows Rating On 7-Point Scale Rating On Dichotomized Scale 1, 2, or 3 1 4, 5, 6, or 7 2 The format for assessment is semi-structured wit h a guideline provided for assessing the global impression of change based on ratings of change for the following individual domains: cognition, behavior, and function. A semi-structured format for assessing the severity of disease at baseline has also been used, again with a guideline provided for assessing the global impression of severity based on ratings of change for the following individual domains: cognition, behavior, and function. 3 Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Activities Of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL) This is a rating scale used to assess basic and instrumental activities of daily living. 23 items are rated by the invest igator using information supplied by the caregiver. The maximum total score is 78. Higher scores indica te better function. 4 Cognitive Drug Research Com puterized Assessment System This is a computer-based system for asse ssing cognitive function. A series of tasks is used to assess each of several specific functions as indicated in the

A series of digits is presented in t he center of the screen at the rate of 80 per minute and the patient is required to press t he “YES” button every time the digit in the series matches the target digit Choice Reaction Time Either the word “NO” or the wo rd “YES” is presented on the monitor and the patient is instructed to press the corresponding button as quickly as possible 5 Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System (D-KEFS) Test Battery This test battery assesses verbal and non- verbal executive functions. 9 tests are included in this battery; each test is intended to be used as either a stand-alone instrument or in conjunction with other tests in the same battery. The tests are as follows: Trail Making Test, Verbal Fluency Test, Design Fluency Test, Color- Word Interference Test, Sorting Test (fo rmerly called the California Card Sorting Test), Twenty Questions Test, Word Cont ext Test, Tower Test, and Proverb Test (formerly called the Calif ornia Proverb Test). Only the Verbal Fluency Test from this battery was eventually used as a uniform outcome measure for this study; only one cond ition of this test, letter fluency, was used; here the patient was asked to generate as many words as possible for 3 different letters of the alpha bet (“F,” “A,” and “S,”) with 60 seconds being allowed for each alphabet tested. 2 other tests, the Sorting Test and the Color-Word

The main outcome variable for each of these measures is listed below: Test Main Outcome Variable D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Test Number of correct responses D-KEFS Sorting Test Sort recognition description score D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test Completion time adjusted for errors 6 Mini-Mental Status Examination This is a validated multi-item instrument that examines orient ation, registration, attention, calculation, recall, visuos patial abilities and language. The maximum score is 30, with higher scores indi cating better cognitive function. 7 Neuropsychiatry Inventory This is a validated instrument that assesses the following 12 domains (subscales): delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphor ia, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behavior, sleep/night-time behavior, and appetite/eating changes . Each domain is ra ted according to its frequency (score ranging from 1 to 4) and seve rity (score ranging from 1 to 3); rating is based on interviewing a caregiver; if a symptom subsumed by a particular domain is absent, it will receive a rating of 0. For eac h domain, the score is the product of frequency and severity, with a maximum score of 12. The maximum total score for the 12 domains (the sum of the subscale scores) is 144 with a higher score indicating greater behavioral abnormality. An earlier version of the Neuropsychiat ry Inventory (Neuropsychiatry Inventory- 10), consisting of the first 10 items above, and with a maximum total score of 100 has also been used. 7.1 Neuropsychiatry Inventory – Distress For each of the 12 items on t he Neuropsychiatry Inventor y, caregiver distress is rated on a 5-point scale from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater distress. 8 Ten-Point Clock Test This test is intended to m easure executive functioning and visuospatial skills. The subject is asked to insert the numbers on the face of the clock and when that task is completed to insert the hands of t he clock so as to indi cate a time of ten minutes past eleven o’clock. The maximu m score on this task is 10, with lower scores indicating greater degrees of impairment

Any statis tical tests performed were to be exploratory • The change from baseline on the UP DRS score was to be analyzed using an analysis of covariance model 1.8.9 Sample Size Rationale Sample size estimates were perfo rmed using the two primary efficacy parameters the ADAS-Cog and the ADCS-CGIC, and is further summarized below 1.8.9.1 Sample Size Estimate Based On ADAS-Cog Estimates of standard deviation from t he intent-to-treat analysis of 6-month change from baseline ADAS-Cog data in clinical trials of Exelon® in Alzheimer’s Disease range from 6 to 7 points To ensure adequate power in case of a higher variability in 6-month change from baseline ADAS-Cog scores in those with Parkinson’s Disease as compared with those with Alzheimer’s Disease, a standard deviation of 7.5 points was assumed for this sample size estimate Using a two-sided test with a signific ance level of 0.05, and a pooled standard deviation of 7.5 points, a total sample size of 531 patients (354 on Exelon® and 177 on placebo) is required to detect a differ ence of at least 2.25 points in the ADAS-Cog change from baseline score between Exelon® and placebo with a power of 90%. 1.8.9.2 Sample Size Estimate Based On ADCS-CGIC Assumptions regarding the variability and treatment differences for the ADCS- CGIC are based on data available for t he CIBIC-Plus from completed Exelon® studies in Alzheimer’s Disease; the ADCS -CGIC and CIBIC-Plus are very similar instruments. To ensure adequate power in case of a higher variability in ADCS-CGIC scores in those with Parkinson’s Disease as compared with those with Alzheimer’s Disease, a standard deviation of 1.3 points was assumed for this sample size estimate Using a two-sided test with a signific ance level of 0.05, and a pooled standard deviation of 1.3 points, a total sample size of 525 patients (350 on Exelon® and 175 on placebo) is required to detect a diff erence of at least 0.40 points on the intent-to-treat analysis in the ADCS-C GIC score at Month 6 between Exelon® and placebo with a power of 90%.

A total of 68 centers participated in the study. 2.1 Patient Disposition A total of 650 patients were screened, of whom 541 were randomized, 362 to the Exelon® group and 179 to the placebo. As the above sponsor table indicates, a total of 410 patients (263 [72.7%] who received Exelon®, and 147 [82.1%] who rece ived placebo, completed the study). As the table above also indicates, the ma jority of discontinuations were due to adverse events: 17.1% of patients in the Exelon® group and 7.8% of patients in the placebo group discontinued on account of adverse events. 2.2 Protocol Deviations Protocol violations are summarized in the following table, which I have copied from the submission.

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 The table indicates that prot ocol violations were sli ghtly more frequent in the Exelon® group than in the placebo group. The most common protocol violation was an increase in dose or the new introduction of a psychotropic or dopaminergic medication; this category of violation was about equal in incidence between the treatment groups. 2.3 Groupings For Analysis The groupings for analysis are summarized in the following sponsor table. ITT: Intent-to-treat LOCF: Last-observation-carried-forward Note that similar proportions of those in the Exelon® and placebo groups are in the intent-to-treat plus retrieved dr opout groups used for the primary efficacy analysis. 2.4 Demographic And Other Baseline Characteristics As the sponsor table below indicates, baseline characteristics for age, gender, and race were comparable between treatment groups. The table pertains to the randomized/safety population

As might be expected from the discontinuation ra tes in each treatment group alluded to before, the mean duration of exposure was slightly lower in the Exelon® group than in the placebo group. The average daily Exelon® dos e per treatment interval is in the next table, which I have copied from the submission. T he average daily Exelon® dose for the entire study (± standard deviation ) is 6.3 mg (± 2.3 mg). 2.6 Concomitant (And Prior) Medication Non-central nervous system related concom itant medications, taken both prior to and after the start of the study, were us ed by 80.7% of pati ents in the Exelon® group and 79.3% of patients in the plac ebo group. The most frequently reported medication was aspirin (16.3% of Exelon®-treated patie nts and 19.6% of placebo-treated patients). Central nervous system-related concomit ant medication taken within 4 weeks prior to start of the study were used by 100% of those in the Exelon® group and 4% of those in the placebo group as might have been expected for a

As the sponsor-supplied table below indicates, the mean change from baseline score for this small subset improved slightly in the Exelon® group and deteriorated slightly in the placebo group, with the difference being nomi nally statistically significant. 2.7.2.7 Mini-Mental Status Examination In the intent-to-treat plus retrieved dropouts population, mean Mini-Mental Status Examination scores increased by 0.8 points in the Exelon® group and decreased by 0.2 points in the placebo, at Week 24, with the difference being nominally statistically significant. Similar result s were seen with the other two analysis populations. 2.7.3 Overall Efficacy Response An overall responder was defined as a pat ient with a combination of the following o An improvement in ADAS-Cog of at least 4 points o ADCS-CGIC category of 1 to 4 o ADCS-ADL change ≥ 0 points The categorical analysis of the percentage of overall responders showed a nominally statistically significant treatment difference favoring Exelon® over placebo at Week 24 for the intent-to-treat-last- observation-carried-forward population only (20% of pati ents in the Exelon® group and 13% of patients in the placebo group were considered responders in this dataset). 2.7.4 Pharmacogenetic Analyses 302 out of 541 randomized patients consented to pharmacogenetic sampling. The results of these analyses ar e to be reported separately. 2.7.5 Biomarker Analyses 356 and 324 patients consent to biom arker serum and urine sampling, respectively. The results of these analyses are to be reported separately.

The following table, copied fr om the submission, summarizes the incidence of the most common adverse events (those with an in cidence of at least 5% in either treatment group) in this study, in descending order of frequency. As the table above indicates, the most common of the adverse events, all of which were more frequent in the Exelon® group than in the placebo group, were nausea, vomiting, tremor, diarrhea, and anorexia. The incidence of dizziness was also substantially greater in the Ex elon® group than in the placebo group. The next table, also copied from the s ubmission, indicates the overall incidence of adverse events during each (4-week) treatment period.

The incidence of such events by system organ cla ss is in the following table. I have read the listings for all individual se rious adverse events. It is hard to link the individual events that occurred in patients treated with Ex elon® to the drug.

Individual adverse events leading to discontinuation that occurred in at least 2 Exelon®-treated patient s are in the following table which I have created from one supplied by the sponsor. Exelon® (n = 362) Placebo (n = 179) Adverse Events N % N % Nausea 13 3.6 1 0.6 Vomiting 7 1.9 1 0.6 Diarrhea 4 1.1 2 1.1 Asthenia 2 0.6 0 0.0 Abasia 2 0.6 0 0.0 Dehydration 2 0.6 1 0.6 Tremor 6 1.7 0 0.0 Parkinson’s Disease 3 0.8 0 0.0 Dizziness 2 0.6 0 0.0 Headache 2 0.6 0 0.0 Parkinsonism 2 0.6 0 0.0 Balance disorder 2 0.6 0 0.0 Hallucination 4 1.1 2 1.1 Confusional state 3 0.8 1 0.6 Hypotension 2 0.6 0 0.0 I have read the listings for all individual adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation. With the exception of events such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which could be a consequence of the cholinomimetic effects of Exelon®, it is hard to link the individual events that occurred in patients treated with Exelon® to the drug. All other events appeared to be consistent with intercurrent illnesses common in the elderly (and in the study population) and their complications. 2.8.3 Other Significant Adverse Events Adverse event terms that might be cons idered to possibly represent a worsening of Parkinson’s Disease were pre-specified in the study protocol . The incidence of all such events was higher in the Exel on® group (27.3%) than in the placebo group (15.6%). The incidence of individual adverse ev ents is summarized in the following table. [A number of additional event terms did not occur at all].

The sponsor has drawn att ention to the following:  The mean QT c interval remained unchanged in the placebo group over the course of the study, but decreased slightly in the Exelon® group at Week 24  A slight increase in mean RR interval was seen in the Exelon® group, but the change was not felt to be statistically significant  Newly occurring clinically significant electrocardiogram abnormalities were seen in 1.4% of patients in the Exelon® group and 1.1% of patients in the placebo group. The new abnormalities seen in the Exelon® group were artificial pacemaker rhythm, right bundle branch block, inferior myocardial infarction, and T wave inversion 2.8.7 UPDRS Part III Scores The UPDRS motor scores were used as a means of assessing changes in the motor manifestations of Parkinson’s Disease during the st udy. The mean change from baseline scores at Weeks 16 and 24 are summarized in the following table, which I have copied from the submission. The changes in each treatment group at each timepoint were similar and were not considered clinically significant. T he differences in change score were not even nominally statistically significant. The sponsor also points out that statistically significant treatment differences were not seen for any of the individual UPDRS Part III item scores. The mean change from baseline for the tremor score at Week 24 was 0.1 ± 2.6 for the Exelon® group and 0.0 ± 2.1 in the placebo group. 3 Sponsor’s Conclusions In this trial, which was conducted in dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease, the efficacy of Exelon® in a dos e of 3 to 12 mg/day for 24 weeks was significantly superior to that of plac ebo on a measure of cognition (which was assessed by the ADAS-Cog) and on a measur e of the clinical global rating of change (ADCS-CGIC). The primary objecti ve of the study was therefore achieved

The safety profile of Exelon® in this study was consistent with published data for Exelon® administered to patients with Al zheimer’s Disease. While the incidence of adverse events associated with a wo rsening of Parkinson’s Disease was higher in the Exelon® group than in t he placebo group, the UPDRS Part III (motor) ratings did not reveal any clinica lly or statistically relevant difference between treatment groups for either the tota l score or any of the individual item scores. Changes in laboratory tests and electrocardiograms were considered clinically insignificant. 4 Study Abstract Emre M, Aarsland D, Albanese A, Byrne EJ, Deu schl G, De Deyn PP, Durif F, Kulisevsky J, van Laar T, Lees A, Poewe W, Robillard A, Rosa MM, Wolters E, Quar g P, Tekin S, Lane R. Rivastigmine for dementia associated with Park inson's disease. N Engl J Med. 2004;351:2509-18 BACKGROUND: Cholinergic deficits are prominent in patients who have dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. We investigated the effects of the dual cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine in such patients. METHODS: Patients in whom mild-to-moderate dementia developed at least 2 years after they received a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 3 to 12 mg of rivastigmine per day for 24 weeks. Primary efficacy va riables were the scores for the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study- Clinician's Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). Secondary clinical outcomes were the scores for the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living, the 10-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the Mini-Mental State Examination, Cognitiv e Drug Research power of attention tests, the Verbal Fluency test, and the Ten Point Clock-Drawing test. RESULTS: A total of 541 patients were enrolled, and 410 completed the study. The outcomes were better among patients treated with rivastigmine than among those who received placebo; however, the differences between these two groups were moderate and similar to those reported in trials of rivastigmine for Alzheimer's disease. Rivastigmine-treated patients had a mean improvement of 2.1 points in the score for the 70-point ADAS-cog, from a baseline score of 23.8, as compared with a 0.7-point worsening in the placebo group, from a baseline score of 24.3 (P<0.001). Clinically meaningful improvements in the scores for the ADCS-CGIC were observed in 19.8 percent of patients in the rivastigmine group and 14.5 percent of those in the placebo group, and clinically meaningful worsening was observed in 13.0 percent and 23.1 percent, respectively (mean score at 24 weeks, 3.8 and 4.3, respectively; P=0.007). Significantly better outcomes were seen with rivastigmine with respect to all se condary efficacy variab les. The most frequent adverse events were nausea (affecting 29.0 percent of patients in the rivastigmine group and 11.2 percent of those in the placebo group, P<0.001), vomiting (1 6.6 and 1.7 percent, P<0.001), and tremor (10.2 and 3.9 percent, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this placebo-controlled study, ri vastigmine was associated with moderate improvements in dementia associated with Parkinson's disease but also with higher rates of nausea, vomiting, and tremor.

Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 5 Additional Observations And Comments By Agency Statistical Reviewer About Study 2311 The Agency Biometrics Reviewer for th is submission, Dr Joanne Zhang, has made the following main observations, and drawn the overall conclusions outlined below regarding the effi cacy results of this study 5.1 Observations • Dr Zhang has independently perform ed the protocol-s pecified primary efficacy analyses and has obtained results that agree with those obtained by the sponsor. However she has the following concerns about these analyses  An assumption underlying the use of an analysis of covariance (used in this instance for the primary efficacy analysis of the ADAS-Cog) is that the data be normally distributed. Dr Zhang tested the residuals for the analysis of covariance model used fo r the ADAS-Cog analysis with the Wilk-Shapiro test; the hypothesis of normality of the residuals was rejected (p-values of 0.0072 for Week 16, and < 0.0072 for Week 24). Dr Zhang therefore used a non-parametric method, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, for the analysis of the ADAS-Cog and demonstrated statistically significant differences favoring Exelon® over placebo at both Weeks 16 and 24 (p < 0.005 at both timepoints)  Another assumption underlying the use of an analysis of covariance model to test for differences between the drug and placebo groups is that of a constant regression relationship between the 2 treatment groups; if that assumption is violated it is indicative of an interaction between the treatment groups and independent variable (i.e., the baseline value) and this interaction renders difficult the interpretation of the final treatment effect due to the drug. Dr Zhang tested the heterogeneity of the slopes for the 2 treatment groups for the ADAS-Cog at Weeks 16 and 24 in the intent-to-treat plus retrieved dropouts population; while the slopes at Week 16 were similar, those at Week 24 were statistically significantly different, as indicated by the table below. Therefore, if the analysis of covariance model is relied on to predict the treatment effect due to the drug, the drug will be underestimated at low baseline values and overestimated at high baseline values. The results of the sponsor’s analysis of covariance applied to the ADAS-Cog change from baseline data at Week 24 therefore need to be interpreted with caution Timepoint Estimate Standard Error P-values for the heterogeneity of slopes Slope for Exelon® Week 16 0.216 0.037 Slope for placebo Week 16 0.215 0.051 0.982 Slope for Exelon® Week 24 0.270 0.041 Slope for placebo Week 24 0.120 0.057 0.034

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06  When the percentage of those improving on the ADCS-CGIC at Weeks 16 and 24 in the Exelon® and placebo groups was compared by country (Austria, Norway, and Portugal were combined as the sample size for each was very small), the Exelon® group performed better than the placebo group for most countries whereas the placebo group performed better than the Exelon® group for the remaining countries • Dr Zhang also repeated the prim ary efficacy analyses on subgroups defined by gender. Some of her findings are reproduced below  The number of male and female patients in each treatment group was as follows Treatment Group Exelon® N Placebo N Women 128 62 Men 234 117  Her subgroup analyses for the intent-to-treat plus retrieved dropouts populations on the ADAS-Cog change from baseline score at Week 24 are below Subgroup Exelon® Mean change (SD) Placebo Mean change (SD) p-value Women 1.9 (8.4) -0.9 (8.0) 0.027 Men 2.2 (8.1) -0.7 (7.2) 0.001  Her subgroup analyses for the intent-to-treat plus retrieved dropouts populations on the ADCS-CGIC score at Week 24 are below Women Men Exelon® Placebo Exelon® Placebo N 116 57 213 108 Mean ± SD 3.9 ± 1.5 4.3 ± 1.4 3.8 ± 1.4 4.3 ± 1.5 Markedly improved (%) 2 2 6 3 Moderately improved (%) 19 14 14 11 Minimally improved (%) 19 11 22 18 Unchanged (%) 28 30 24 27 Minimally worse (%) 14 21 24 19 Moderately worse (%) 15 19 8 15 Markedly worse (%) 3 4 2 8 p-value 0.350 0.045 • She has noted that the sponsor has used the intent -to-treat plus retrieved dropouts population for the primary effi cacy analysis, whereas the Agency usually recommends that the intent-to-treat last-observation-carried- forward population be us ed for that purpose. She does, however, also note that when the same analysis was repeated for the intent-to-treat last-observation-carried-forward populati on, the results were similar.

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 5.2 Conclusions Dr Zhang has concluded that the data provided support the efficacy of Exelon® in Parkinson’s Disease Dementia, based on the prospectively-specified statistical analysis plan; several sensitivity anal yses support this conclusion. She does, however, note that a gender-based subgroup analysis suggests that this benefit may not extend to women. 6 Reviewer’s Comments 6.1 Efficacy Of Exelon® This study does indicate that Exelon® in a dose of 3 to 12 mg/day did have efficacy in the entire study population, bas ed on prospectively-specified criteria. Although a statistically significant treatment effect was not seen in women alone on the gender-based subgroup analysis for the ADCS-CGIC per formed by the Agency Biometrics Reviewer, the effect size s (and variance) in that subgroup for the mean change from baseline to W eek 24 in ADAS-Cog score and mean ADCS-CGIC score were similar to thos e seen in men, while fewer women than men were enrolled in the study. The implications of the results of this st udy in the context of the new claim (i.e., “treatment of mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease”) sought by the sponsor in this Supplemental Application are discussed later in the review. 6.2 Safety Of Exelon® The safety data for this study indicate that the adverse event profile of Exelon® in the study population was largely similar to that seen in clinical trials with Alzheimer’s Disease, in that there was a distinctly higher frequency of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia in thos e exposed to Exelon® than in those exposed to placebo. Of special relevance to a population with Parkinson’s Disease, was the observation that tremor (which was not further characterized) was recorded as a treatment-emergent adverse event in about 10% of those received Exelon® and 4% of those who received placebo in this st udy (in the controlled clinical trials of Exelon® that were conducted prior to its approval for Alzheimer’s Disease, tremor was seen in about 4% of those who received Exelon® and 1% of those who received placebo). Several other adver se events that may conceivably have been linked to a worsening in Parkinson’ s Disease were also more frequent in those treated with Exelon® than in those treated with placebo, but their incidence in the Exelon®-treated group was lower than that of tremor. However, changes in UPDRS total motor scores, probably a more objective measure of change in the motor manifestations of Parkinson’s Disease than the incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events, showed no meaningful difference between treatment groups.

As noted above, 17.1% of patients enrolled in this study experienced a serious adverse event, and 15.1% of patients enroll ed experienced an adverse event that warranted treatment discontinuation. The most frequent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were as follows, based on treatment assignment in the earlier double-blind study.

These changes were small. 2.8 Electrocardiograms No electrocardiograms were performed during this study. 2.9 UPDRS Part III Scores Patients enrolled in the open-label extension study worsened by a mean (± standard deviation) of 1.8 point s (± 9.6 points) on the to tal UPDRS Part III score. Individual tremor score worsened by a m ean (± standard deviation) of 0.1 points (± 2.3 points). 3 Sponsor’s Conclusions Regarding Safety In patients treated with Ex elon® or placebo in Study 2311, the safety and tolerability of Exelon® in a dose of 3 to 12 mg/day in Study 2311E1 remained favorable, with no new unexpected adver se events reported and no clinically significant worsening of the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease. The tolerability profile of profile of Exelon® did not change over the 24-week open-label extension study. 4 Reviewer’s Comments I agree with the sponsor’s conclusions

Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 2.3 Primary Analysis Results The sponsor table below is intended to illustrate the ability of the mean ADAS- Cog score at baseline to differentiate between mild and moderate Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (and Alzheimer’s Dis ease), based on a t-test and supported by an analysis of variance with severity group and center as fixed effects. The sponsor points out that the mean ADAS-Cog score at baseline shows a distinct separation between mild and moderate patients in both the Parkinson’s Disease Dementia and Alzheimer’s Dis ease groups, with a similar variance associated with the mean in each dementia type and severity. The difference in mean ADAS-Cog score between the mild and moderate groups was statistically significant for each dementia type. The size of the mean difference between Mi ni-Mental Status Examination strata was also examined using a Cohen’s effect size computation. Using that computation, effect sizes of 0.2, 0. 5, and 0.8 are generally considered small, medium, and large, respectively. Cohen’s effect size for the mean difference between disease severities by dementia ty pe, as determined by the sponsor, is in the following table; while this effect si ze was larger for the Alzheimer’s Disease group, it remained large for the group with Parkinson’s Disease Dementia as well. These results also suggest that t he ADAS-Cog is a scale that can produce a good separation between Mini-Ment al Status Examination strata in the patients studied.

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 The test-retest reliability of the ADAS- Cog in this population was evaluated by determining the correlation coefficient between the ADAS-Cog value at baseline and that at Week 4 for each dementia ty pe and severity; the results are in the following table contained in the submission, which indicates, according to the sponsor, that the correlation coefficient s for the ADAS-Cog at baseline and Week 4 were strongly positive regardless of dementia type and severity; the sponsor further states that although the confidence intervals for each correlation coefficient were wide, even their lowe r limits showed a positive correlation. 2.4 Secondary Analyses 2.4.1 Ability Of Dementia-Rating Sc ales And Tests Other Than The ADAS- Cog To Differentiate Between Alzhei mer’s Disease Of Mild And Moderate Severity (Assessment Of Criterion-Related Validity) The ability of dementia rating scales and tests other than the ADAS-Cog to differentiate between mild and moderate severity Parkinson’s Disease Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease were evaluated as with the ADAS-Cog by comparing the mean values obtained for each severity category at baseline and at Week 4, using a t-test. The results are in the following table, which indicate that for both types of dementia, the separation between mild and moderate severities was nominally statistically significant fo r the ADCS-ADL, Ten-Point Clock Test, Trailmaking Test A, and D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Test.

Test-retest reliability by dementia ty pe and Mini-Mental Status Examination stratum is summarized in the following table, taken from the submission; reliability was determined, as with the ADAS-Cog by calculating correlation coefficients based on the baseline and Week 4 scores .

The sponsor points out that statistically significant differences between the 2 populations were not apparent except for the ADCS-ADL score.

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 The sponsor has performed a factor anal ysis of the ADAS-C og sub-item scores at baseline for the Parkinson’s Dis ease Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease populations, as indicated in the following table, taken from the submission. The sponsor has observed that the sub-items group differ ently in each population, which may indicate a different profile of cognitive impairment. The sponsor does acknowledge that the sample sizes were small for these analyses. 2.4.3 Convergent And Divergent Construct Validity Of The ADAS-Cog In Patients With Alzheimer’s Disease And With Parkinson’s Disease Dementia The degree of association between the ADAS-Cog and other scales was explored by performing a correlation test between the ADAS-Cog scores and those of each of the other scales at base line. The sponsor considers the results, summarized in the table below, to indicate at least a moderate correlation of the ADAS-Cog with all assessments other than the Neuropsychiatry Inventory and

Correlation was best between the ADAS- Cog and Mini-Mental Status Examination, in both populations. 3 Sponsor’s Conclusions The following is a summary of the sponsor’s conclusions:  In patients with Parkinson’s Disea se Dementia, grouped into “mild” and “moderate” categories by baseline Mini -Mental Status Examination score, the ADAS-Cog score at baseline showed a statistically significant difference between these categories, thus demonstrating criterion-related validity for the ADAS-Cog, based on severi ty as the criterion. In the same population, a similar criterion-related validity was also demonstrated for the ADCS-ADL, Ten-Point Clock Tes t, Trailmaking Test A, and D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Test  The ADAS-Cog and several other scales demonstrated test-retest reliability when used in patients with Parkinson’s Disease Dementia.  When the ADAS-Cog was correlated with scales that measured similar and different symptom domains, c onvergent and divergent construct validity was demonstrated for the ADAS-Cog in pat ients with Parkinson’s Disease Dementia.  For patients with a similar severity of dementia, as determined by Mini- Mental Status Examination score, total scores achieved on specific dementia rating scales in patients wit h Parkinson’s Disease Dementia were similar to those in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease. However, a factor analysis that compared the 2 populations on AD AS-Cog sub-item scores has indicated that the sub-items group differently in each

Summary Of Earlier Meeting Between Division And Sponsor Regarding This Application. A meeting was held with the sponsor on May 18, 2005, at which the results of Study 2311 (EXPRESS Study) were discussed in outline and on a preliminary basis, in the context of a sponsor proposal to expand the current indication for Exelon® to include “the treatment of mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease.” The following is a summary of the salient views conveyed by the sponsor’s team at that meeting.  The entity of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease (as exemplified by the patients enrolled in the EXPRESS Study) is linked to distinctive neuropathological findings (i.e., widespread Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites), with more recent publications strongly suggesting that the contribution of co-existing Alzheimer’s-type neuropathological changes (e.g., senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) to the dementia are minor  A cholinergic deficiency state is the basis for dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease, just as with Alzheimer’s Disease  The population enrolled in the EXPRESS trial was distinct from that enrolled in the pre-approval clinical trials of rivastigmine in Alzheimer’s Disease (and was actually excluded from those trials)  Although patients enrolled in the EXPRESS trial were not selected based on those neuropsychological deficits that, according to the DSM IV definition of “Dementia Due To Parkinson’s Disease,” (294. 1) are distinctive for that disorder (i.e., “cognitive and motor slowing, executive dysfunction, and impairment in memory retrieval”), selecting patients based on the extent of such deficits is unlikely to help differentiate them from patients with Alzheimer’s Disease  The results of the EXPRESS Study are sufficiently robust for that study alone to be the basis for the expansion of the current claim to include dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease, especially since the mechanism by which rivastigmine may have its effect in that condition and in Alzheimer’s Disease may be the same. The Division’s key concerns about an expansion of the current claim for rivastigmine to include dementia associ ated with Parkinson’s Disease, especially on the basis of the result s of the EXPRESS study alone, were as follows  The criteria used to diagnose dementia when including patients in the EXPRESS Study were no different from those used to enroll patients in the pre-approval

--- Page 67 ---
Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 efficacy studies of rivastigmine in Alzheimer’s Disease; i.e., these patients were not identified on the basis of any purportedly distinctive features of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease. In addition, the clinical course of the placebo arm and the size of the effect seen with rivastigmine in the EXPRESS trial were no different from similar observations in pre-approval efficacy trials of rivastigmine in Alzheimer’s Disease. These observations call into question how distinct the patients in the EXPRESS trial were from those enrolled in the pre-approval Alzheimer’s Disease trials, and whether any effect of rivastigmine on performance that was seen in the former study was mediated through its effects on co-existing Alzheimer’s Disease.  DSM-IV is a standard reference manual containing diagnostic criteria for the entire spectrum of psychiatric and neuropsychiatric disorders, including “Dementia Due To Parkinson’s Disease” (294.1). In the EXPRESS Study, patients with dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease were enrolled based on their having dementia, but without the more distinctive cognitive deficits described in DSM-IV, thus raising the possibility that the appropriate diagnostic criteria for that entity may not have been applied in that study.  The sponsor is currently seeking a claim for the use of rivastigmine in dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease based on a single study (i.e., EXPRESS). While the sponsor considers the results of that study to be robust, the Division has generally required that evidence for the efficacy of a drug in a distinct clinical entity be replicated, and a second study would, therefore, ordinarily be required to address the claim that the sponsor is currently pursuing The Division was of the view that the entity of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease should be discussed at a meeting of the Peripheral and Central Nervous Systems Drugs Adviso ry Committee. The sponsor proposed submitting a Supplemental NDA based on efficacy data from the EXPRESS Study only, with a request for a standard review and the possibility of holding a meeting of the Advisory Committee duri ng the course of that review was discussed. The Division was, very shortly after the m eeting, to discuss internally whether it would be prepared to file a Supplemental NDA for rivastigmine in the treatment of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease, based on efficacy data derived from the EXPRESS Study al one, given the proposed common mechanism of action of rivastigmine in both dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease, and was to inform t he sponsor of its view shortly. On May 24, 2005, the Division informed the s ponsor that it would accept the filing of a Supplemental NDA for Exelon® in t he treatment of demen tia associated with Parkinson’s Disease based on the results of the EXPRESS Study alone and that review of that application would include a discussion with the Peripheral and Central Nervous Systems Drugs Advisory Committee during the 10-month review period.

Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 Sponsor’s Current View Of Dementia Associated With Parkinson’s Disease, And Appr opriateness Of ADAS-Cog And ADCS-ADL In Evaluating Treatment Effects In Dementia Associated With Parkinson’s Disease Separate independent expert reports have been commissioned by the sponsor to address each of these 2 subjects. The c ontents of these repo rts, with which the sponsor appears to concur, are summariz ed below. Note that the sponsor has supplemented the results of the second of the reports below with the conclusions drawn from Study 2314. 1 Dementia Associated With Parkinson’s Disease (Expert Report: Diagnosing Dementia Associated With Parkinson’s Disease And Distinguishing It From Alzheimer’s Disease) The report has been prepared by 3 academic s at the request of the sponsor. These individuals are Professors J. Cummings, M. Emre, and C. W. Olanow. In the report they have provided their opinion in 2 areas • Whether the dementia asso ciated with Parkinson’s Disease is a different disease entity from the dementia a ssociated with Alzheimer’s Disease • Whether practitioners can diffe rentiate the 2 conditions They have concluded that • There is a distinction between dem entia associated with Parkinson’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease • Operational criteria pe rmit the 2 conditions to be readily distinguished • The same operational criteria can be applied by community practitioners to easily differentiate between the 2 conditions The basis for their conclusions, as st ated in the report, is provided under the headings below, which are the same as th ose used by the author s of the report; Please see the text of the report for full details. Note that although many publications are cited in t he report, full citations are provided for only some of those publications; also note that so me publications cited are untraceable through standard search engines. 1.1 Prevalence And Incidence Of Dem entia Associated With Parkinson’s Disease • Based on a published meta-analysis, the prevalence of dementia in patients with Parkinson’s Disease is about 40%. However, since dementia in Parkinson’s Disease is associated with increased mortality, it is likely to be under-represented in cross-sectional studies or in longitudinal studies that do not account for differential mortality

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 • Incidence studies, which are relatively free of survival bias indicate a 4-6 times higher incidence of dementia in patients with Parkinson’s Disease as compared with age-matched controls; since the incidence of dementia in the control population probabl y represents the occurrence of Alzheimer’s Disease and other degener ative and symptomatic dementias in the population, the increased incidence of dem entia in populations with Parkinson’s Disease in all likelihood represents an excess of dementia that is directly attributable to Parkinson’s Disease 1.2 Risk Factors For Dementia A ssociated With Parkinson’s Disease • The most significant risk factors fo r dementia in patients with Parkinson’s Disease are old age, duration of Park inson’s Disease, age at onset of Parkinson’s Disease, akinetic-rigid form of the disease, and the severity of motor symptoms • The presence of subtle involvem ent of executive functions in non- demented Parkinson’s Disease pati ents predicts the emergence of dementia later • Dementia becomes more common with advancing Parkinson’s Disease • Risk factors for dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease differ from those for Alzheimer’s Disease, with t he principal risk factor for the former being the presence of Park inson’s Disease itself • The diagnostic entities of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease and probable Alzheimer’s Disease are mu tually exclusive by definition, since the diagnosis of probable Al zheimer’s Disease (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria)/dementia of the Alzhei mer’s type (American Psychiatric Association criteria) requires the ex clusion of other brain disorders capable of causing a dementia syndrome 1.3 Genetic Distinctions Between Al zheimer’s Disease And Parkinson’s Disease • The majority of cases of both Parkinson’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease occur sporadically. However, genetic mutations have been identified in some Alzheimer’s Diseas e and Parkinson’s Disease patients; the genetic mutations associated with Parkinson’s Disease differ from those associated with Alzheimer’s Disease, and no gene mutation has been identified which causes both. Such genetic defects as have been associated with Alzheimer’s Disease t end to be associated with disorders of amyloid production and metabolism, while some genetic forms of Parkinson’s Disease are associated with mutations and increased deposition of alpha-synuclein

Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 • There is no excess of Alzh eimer’s Disease among probands with Parkinson’s Disease as might be anticipated if the major genetic factors contributing to their etiologies are shared • Specific APOE alleles tend to be associated with Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease, respectively. • The genetic distinctions between Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease are summarized in the table below Genetic Feature Dementia Associated with Parkinson’s Disease Alzheimer’s Disease Causative mutations Alpha-synuclein, PARKIN, UCH-L1, PARK-8, PINK-1, DJ-1 PS1, PS2, APP APOE-4 influence No effect on PDD; increases age-related or AD-type pathology Major risk factor APOE-2 influence Increases PDD Decreases AD AD: Alzheimer’s Disease PDD: dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease 1.4 Neuropathological Distinctions Between Alzheimer’s Disease And Parkinson’s Disease • Stains that are specific and sens itive for detecting Lewy body and neurite pathology in Parkinson’s Disease hav e been helpful in understanding the basis for dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease • Cortical Lewy bodies and the extent of Lewy neurites in the CA2 region of the hippocampus show a strong correla tion with the extent of cognitive impairment • Marked nigrostriatal dopaminergi c neuronal degeneration is a unique pathological feature of dementia associated wit h Parkinson’s Disease. Pathological abnormalities in the locu s ceruleus may also contribute to dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease • In Parkinson’s Disease, there is also a loss of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert and a mark ed cholinergic deficiency, both of which may occur early in the course of that disorder. These changes are most pronounced in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease. The severity of the cholinergic deficiency in dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease is greater than that occurring in Alzheimer’s Disease.

Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 • While the pathological abnormalities c haracteristic of Alzheimer’s Disease (i.e., neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques) are commonly present in patients with dementia asso ciated with Parkinson’ s Disease, they are more commonly present when dementia is advanced, and they do not account for all or even a majority of cases of dement ia associated with Parkinson’s Disease • Differences in the neuropatholog y of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease are summarized in the following table, which I have c opied from the submission Pathological Feature Dementia Associated with Parkinson’s Disease Alzheimer’s Disease Lewy bodies Correlate highly with cognitive impairment Rare Senile plaques Low sensitivity fo r dementia Present in all cases Neurofibrillary tangles Low sensitivity fo r dementia Present in nearly all cases Cholinergic deficit More marked Less marked Dopaminergic deficit Present Absent Noradrenergic deficit Present Present 1.5 Neuroimaging In Dementia A ssociated With Parkinson’s Disease Only limited neuroimaging studies have been done in dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease. Preliminary MRI observations suggest that while atrophy of t he temporal lobes, including the hippocampus and parahippocam pal gyrus, is more severe in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease, severe atrophy of the thalamus and occipital lobes is more characteristic of Parkinson’s Disease. Functional imaging studies (single-phot on emission computerized tomography; positron emission tomography) using r adiolabeled ligands which provide a measure of pre-synaptic dopaminergi c neurons and terminals have revealed significant reductions in striatal uptake or binding of these ligands, as compared with patients who have Alzhei mer’s Disease or controls. 1.6 Neuropsychological Differences Between Dementia Associated With Parkinson’s Disease And Alzheimer’s Disease These differences are summarized in the following table, which I have modified slightly, for the sake of clarity, from one contained in the submission.

Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 Reviewer’s Note: What is actually stated in DSM-IV (see below) is not quite the same as the above 1 Dementia Due To Parkinson’s Disease The essential feature of Dementia Due To Parkinson’s Disease is the presence of dementia that is judged to be of direct pathophysiological consequence of Parkins on’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is a slowly progressive neurological condition, characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Dementia has been reported to occur in approximately 20%-60% of individuals with Parkinson’s disease and is more likely to be present in older individuals or in those with more severe or advanced disease. The dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease is char acterized by cognitive and motor slowing, executive dysfunction and impairment in memory retrieval. Dec lining cognitive performance in individuals with Parkinson’s disease is frequently exacerbated by depr ession. Findings on physical examination include the characteristic abnormal motor signs of resting tremor , evidence of slowness and poverty of movement (such as micrographia), or muscular rigidity and loss of associated movements. At autopsy, neuronal loss and Lewy bodies are evident in the substantia nigra. Ther e are a number of syndromes that manifest with dementia, Parkinsonian movement disorders, and additional neurological features (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy, olivopontocerebellar degeneration, and Vascular Dementia). Some individuals with Parkinson’s disease and dementia are found at autopsy to have coexisting neuropathology indicative of Alzheimer’s disease or of diffuse Lewy body disease. A medical practitioner can apply these criteria easily. 2 Appropriateness Of Using The ADAS-Cog And ADCS-ADL As Outcome Measures In Dementia Associated With Parkinson’s Disease An expert report prepared by Philip D. Ha rvey, PhD, has been provided in this submission. Although this report addre sses both the use of the ADAS-Cog and ADCS-ADL in this condition, it is entitled: “Reliability and Validity of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cogn itive Subscale in Clinical Trials for Dementia Associated with Parkinson’s Disease.” The report was created partly in response to comments made by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products/Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products after review of an earlie r version of the protocol for the non- interventional study 2314. Note that this report, which was comp leted on October 28, 2004, does not cite the results of either Study 2311 or Study 2314, and appears to have been completed without taking these data into cons ideration. It is based on a review of the medical literature (but that review does not include the published results of Study 2311). The contents of this report are brie fly summarized below under the following headings.

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 2.1 ADAS-Cog 2.1.1 ADAS-Cog In Alzheimer’s Disease The author of the report states that t he ADAS-Cog has the following properties when used in Alzheimer’s Disease.  Reliability  Face validity and sensitivity to impairment  Sensitivity to change (criterion validity) The author also points out t hat in efficacy studies in this population, the benefits of active treatment are evaluated in re lation to placebo groups which experience a decline in cognition over the study; in some of these studies, the active treatment group experienced no improvement relative to baseline. In other words, a net benefit relative to plac ebo is assessed rather than an absolute improvement with active treatme nt relative to baseline. 2.1.2 ADAS-Cog In Parkinson’s Disease Dementia The following is a summary of what is stated by the author of this report. 2.1.2.1 Face Validity Of ADAS-Cog Parkinson’s Disease Dementia is characterized by the following  Impaired memory, but of less severi ty than that seen in Alzheimer’s Disease. (The memory deficit seen in Pa rkinson’s Disease Dementia is of the subcortical variety with impaired ra te of learning and free recall, but with preserved delayed recognition memory [the impairments of memory are related to changes in cort ical cholinergic function])  Executive function deficits along with deficits in motor speed and working memory, which in themselves are unlik ely to fully account for the memory deficits seen in this condition. (The author also indicates that cognitive test performance may be influenced by depression, motor symptoms, bradykinesia, and bradyphrenia) While executive dysfunction is not well assessed by the ADAS-Cog, it is a feature of both Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease Dementia. The ADAS-Cog is sufficient to eval uate episodic memory impairment in Parkinson’s Disease Dementia and therefore capt ures critical f eatures of that condition. 2.1.2.2 Temporal Change In ADAS-Cog The course of cognitive decline in Pa rkinson’s Disease Dementia has not been adequately studied; existing published studies have a number of limitations. The

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 few treatment studies in this condit ion prior to Study 2311 suggest that the cognitive change that occurs in Parkins on’s Disease Dementia over time is not as rapid or extensive as that seen over a similar period in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease. 2.1.2.3 Sensitivity To Impairment And To Effects Of Treatment The very limited literature covering the use of the ADAS-Cog in Parkinson’s Disease Dementia suggests that scores on t hat instrument correlate with those on the Mini-Mental Status Examination, suggesting that the ADAS-Cog is sensitive to impairment in that conditi on. The limited literat ure available also suggests that the ADAS-Cog is as sensitiv e to treatment effects in Parkinson’s Disease Dementia as in Alzheimer’s Disease. 2.1.2.4 Criterion Validity: Clinically Relevant Differences Based on the small number of published studies, treatment effects in Parkinson’s Disease Dementia, as measured by the ADAS-Cog, are at least as large as those in Alzheimer’s Disease and, therefore, at least as clinically meaningful. 2.2 ADCS-ADL 2.2.1 ADCS-ADL In Alzheimer’s Disease The author highlights the following properti es of the ADCS-ADL in Alzheimer’s Disease, based on the publis hed literature: • Good test-retest reliability • Convergent validity  Good correlation of individual items on the scale with the level of dementia severity as measured by the Mini-Mental Status Examination  Ability to detect a decline in activities of daily living across levels of dementia severity  Significant correlation with scores on various cognitive measures such as the ADAS-Cog and Mini-Mental Status Examination • Sensitivity to treatment effects in clinical drug trials in Alzheimer’s Disease 2.2.2 ADCS-ADL In Parkinson’s Disease Dementia While there are no published studies of t he use of the ADCS-ADL in Parkinson’s Disease Dementia, the experience in Alzheimer’s Disease supports its use as a “secondary” outcome measure in Parkinson’s Disease Dementia. However, clinical changes in domains in Parkinson’s Disease other than cognition can result in changes in performance on activities of daily living.

Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 Review Of Proposed Labeling Deferred Comments 1 General In this supplemental New Drug Application, the sponsor is seeking the approval of Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) capsules for the treatment of “mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease .” The putative entit y of “mild to moderate dementia associated with Park inson’s Disease” has also been referred to, interchangeably, as “Parkinson’s Dis ease Dementia” in this application. Exelon® is currently approved for marketing in this country, as both capsule and oral solution formulations, for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer’s type. The sponsor has provided evidence from two completed clinical studies in support of the efficacy and safety of Ex elon® for the proposed new indication. These are:  Study 2311, which was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-arm in design  Study 2311E1, the open-label uncontrolled extension to Study 2311 In addition, the sponsor has performed a non-interventional study (Study 2314) of the validity of a number of assessment scales in the Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (and vascular dementia); parti al results for this study have been submitted in this application. 2 Efficacy 2.1 Summary Of Study 2311 The results of a single randomized, double- blind, placebo-cont rolled study (also referred to as the EXPRESS Study) of the efficacy of rivastigmine in the proposed entity of Parkinson’s Disease Dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease has been submitted in th is application. The main features of this study were as follows  This was a randomized (2:1 [Exelon®:Placebo]), double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel-arm study  The key inclusion criteria for the study were as follows

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 Key efficacy results for this study were as follows • 541 patients were randomized, of whom 442 patients completed the study. Their distribution by treatment group was as follows: Treatment Group Exelon® Placebo Number randomized 362 179 Number completed 263 147 • The primary efficacy analysis, using Study Week 24 as the endpoint, revealed statistically significant differences between the treatment groups on the ADAS- Cog (difference in mean change from baseline score at endpoint: 2.90; p < 001) and ADCS-CGIC (difference in mean score between treatment groups at endpoint: 0.5; p = 0.007). Note that an Agency statistical reviewer has judged the distribution of ADAS-Cog data not to be normal and therefore in violation of the assumptions of the analysis of covariance model proposed; however, even with the use of a non-parametric model, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, the Exelon® group showed a statistically significant superiority over placebo on this measure • Nominally statistically significant differences were seen between the treatment groups on all secondary efficacy variables at Week 24 in the same dataset as that used for the primary efficacy analysis • Analyses of the primary efficacy parameters using other datasets (intent-to-treat last-observation-carried-forward, and observed cases) yielded similar results. 2.2 Sponsor’s View Of The Entity Of Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (Dementia Associated With Parkinson’s Disease) The sponsor’s view of the entity of dementia associat ed with Parkinson’s Disease appears to be consistent with an expert repor t included in this submission. The main conclusions of the expert report may be summarized as follows: • Based on epidemiologic, genetic, neuropathological, neuroimaging, and cognitive and non-cognitive clinical data, dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease is an entity distinct from Alzheimer’s Disease. • The severity of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease is better correlated with pathological changes that are distinctive for Parkinson’s Disease such as the presence of cortical Lewy bodies. Although neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques are frequently present in the brains of patients with dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease, the extent of these changes is less pronounced than those that are distinctive for Parkinson’s Disease and less well-correlated with the severity of dementia. The neuropathological changes in the brains of patients with dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease include lesions of cholinergic pathways distinct from those seen in Alzheimer’s Disease. Marked nigrostriatal neuronal degeneration is a unique feature of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease; cell loss in the medial substantia nigra is

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 associated with the presence of dementia. Pathological abnormalities in the locus ceruleus may also contribute to the dementia of Alzheimer’s Disease. • The diagnostic entities of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease are mutually exclusive by definition. The diagnosis of dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease should be based on the presence of all of the following criteria [which the sponsor believes are stipulated in DSM-IV (294.1)] o Presence of Parkinson’s Disease o Presence of dementia syndrome o Evidence of Parkinson’s Disease prior to the onset of dementia o Exclusion of other causes of dementia • Dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease is an entity that be diagnosed by a community medical practitioner 2.3 Implications Of Efficacy Results Of Study 2311 (EXPRESS Study) Study 2311 may be considered “positive” in that it demonstrates the efficacy of Exelon® in the study popul ation based on prospectively-specified criteria for success. The dual efficacy outcome measure paradigm used for demonstrating the efficacy of Exelon® in this study is the same as used to demonstrate the efficacy of drugs approved for the treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease (dementia of the Alzheimer’s type). However, the key regulatory question that needs to be addressed in the context of this application is whethe r the results of Study 2311 establish that Exelon® is effective in the treatme nt of an entity (dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease [Parkins on’s Disease Dementia]) that is sufficiently distinct from mild to mode rate dementia of the Alzheimer’s type [for the treatment of which Exelon® is already approved] to justify a separate regulatory claim . Note that for a drug to be approved for a specific condition the following must generally be true  The condition can be defined without ambiguity using criteria that have wide acceptance, and are both valid and reliable  Appropriate instruments be used for measurement of the clinical effect of the drug on that condition; such instruments must measure what they are intended to under the conditions under which they are actively employed  Clinical trials should be appropriately designed to measure that effect  The effect measured should be clinically meaningful I will address the question (in bolded text) above, and several additional questions under the following headings

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 2.3.1 Is Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease) a distinct entity (i.e ., distinct from Alzheimer’s Disease) and do widely accepted, valid, and reliable criter ia exist for its clinical diagnosis?  While it is widely accepted that there is an increased prevalence of dementia in Parkinson’s Disease, the pathological basis for that dementia has been a matter of cont roversy, in regard to both the specific histopathological abnormalities seen and their location. The medical literature indicates that in patients with Parkinson’s Disease who develop dementia, the neuropathological findings are varied; while a number of the pathological abnormalities seen are cons idered distinctive for that entity (e.g., cortical Lewy bodies and degener ation of the medial substantia nigra) and may correlate best with the severity of dementia, Alzheimer’s- type pathology (such as neurofibrilla ry tangles and amyloid plaques) frequently co-exists, albeit often not to a sufficient degree for a separate pathological diagnosis of Alzheime r’s Disease to be made; pathological lesions attributed to cerebrovascula r disease may also co-exist. The variability in pathological abnormalities described in those studies may, in part, reflect differences in the methods used in each instance. More recently published studies are cons idered by some to indicate that earlier histopathological data may have underestimated the extent to which Lewy bodies were present in the brain (and especially in the neocortex and limbic cortex) of pa tients with Parkinson’s Disease and dementia; these studies were done prio r to the availability of modern immunohistochemical techniques such as stains for ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein. The earlier studies may, t herefore, according to the sponsor and others, have attributed a greater-t han-justified role for Alzheimer’s type pathology in the pathogenesis of dem entia in these patients, while more recent studies suggest that co rtical Lewy bodies may have a greater role in the pathogenesis of dementia, although their extent may not correlate with the severity of dementia (see Braak H et al below) . Thus, recently published data suggest that the pathological substrate underlying the dementia that occurs in Parkinson’s Disease may be more distinctive for that disease than previ ously believed. Note that a recent consensus report (McKeith et al [ 2005]) for a closely-linked disorder, dementia with Lewy bodies (see below ), states that “the relative contributions of Lewy body formation and synuclein pathology, Alzheimer’s Disease-type pathology, neuron loss, or neurochemical deficits as determinants of dementia in Parkinson’s Disease remain unresolved although recent studies suggest that Lewy-related pathology is more strongly associated than Alzheimer’s Disease-type changes. The cholinergic deficit seen in pati ents with Parkinson’s Disease dementia has been linked to the loss of neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert

Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 and to a more marked brain choliner gic deficiency than in Alzheimer’s Disease. • A further question is whether the dementia that occurs in Parkinson’s Disease is clinically distinct or dissimilar from that which occurs in Alzheimer’s Disease, and in other types of primary degenerative dementia, and whether validated criteria exist for the diagnosis of the former. Many publications, including relatively recent articles, state that the cognitive deficits that are seen in t he dementia that occurs in Parkinson’s Disease are distinctive to at least so me degree, with the following higher cortical process being impaired to a greater degree, and, in some instances, qualitatively, as comp ared with patients with Alzheimer’s Disease:  Attention (fluctuations in attention are also seen)  Executive functions  Free recall memory (with preserved recognition memory)  Visuospatial function  Verbal fluency (with other aspects of language function, as well as praxis, being preserved)  Speed of mental processing Behavioral and personality changes are also stated to be more common in Parkinson’s Disease than in Alzheimer’s Disease • Criteria for diagnosing “Dementia Due To Parkinson’s Disease” exist under DSM-IV (294.1). These criteria state that “the essential feature of Dementia Due To Parkinson’s Disease is the presence of dementia that is judged to be of direct pathophysiological consequence of Parkinson’s disease” but do not provide a further indica tion of how that judgment is to be made beyond stating that “dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease” is “characterized by cogni tive and motor slowing, executive dysfunction, and impairment in memory re trieval.” The criter ia are primarily descriptive, and, importantly, do not clearly state how this entity is to be distinguished from other dementias such as Alzheimer’s Disease; they have never been validated against the hist opathological abnormalities that have recently been described as being more distinctive for dementia in Parkinson’s Disease; in fact, these cr iteria are deficient enough in their specifications, or lack thereof, that they are likely to be difficult to apply in a validation study. Note that a just-issued American Academy of Neurology Practice Parameter (see Mi yasaki et al, below) suggests that given the pattern of deficits report ed to seen in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease, the DSM-IV criteria for establishing dementia per se may not be appropriate to use.

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 A recently published relatively large st udy (see Braak H et al below) that correlated cognitive status with neuropathological stage in Parkinson’s Disease, and concluded that the burden of Alzhei mer -type pathological changes was relatively low in such pat ients, did not require that patients with dementia who were included in that study needed to have a specific pattern of cognitive deficits such as that considered by some authors to be distinctive for Parkinson’s Disease (see above). The criteria used were as follows  Clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease  Presence of dementia, without that dementia syndrome needing to have any distinctive features  Evidence of Parkinson’s Disease more than a year prior to the onset of dementia A number of other published studies t hat have reported clinicopathological correlations in demented patients with Parkinson’s Disease have also not required such patients to have a specif ic qualitative pattern of cognitive deficits Thus, there do not appear to be validated diagnostic criteria for Parkinson’s Disease Dementia, let alone criteria that st ipulate that a specific pattern of cognitive deficits must be present. The remaining question is whether the clinical diagnos is of Parkinson’s Disease together with the presence of dementia (but without a specific pattern of cognitive deficits), with the onset of Parkins on’s Disease preceding the onset of dementia by not more than two years and the exclusion of other causes of dementia to the extent clinically possi ble, are together su fficient to define a clinical syndrome that is sufficiently distinct from Alzheimer’s Disease to justify a separate treatment claim. • Note that the recently-issued American Academy of Neurology Practice Parameter (see Miyasaki et al, below ) contains the following statements, among others, in regard to dementia in Parkinson’s Disease (PD)  “The etiology of dementia in PD is unclear”  Cognitive decline in PD is characterized by impaired executive function, visuospatial abnormalities, impair ed memory, and language deficits. An appropriate scale that reliably incorpor ates executive function (e.g., frontal assessment battery and other practical tests of executive function) should be incorporated into a screening test fo r PD dementia. When evaluating new screening tools, the DSM-IV criteria for dementia may not be the most appropriate gold standard for patients with PD. DSM-IV criteria for dementia have not been validated in PD. In PD patients, it may be difficult to assess impairments in domains other than memory.

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 2.3.2 What are the implic ations of the diagnostic criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies for the entity of Pa rkinson’s Disease Dementia? Another entity that combines dementia with features of Parkinson’s Disease is dementia with Lewy bodies for which revised diagnostic criteria have recently been proposed (see McKeith et al [2005] bel ow). In the more recent medical literature, this entity has generally been distinguished from Parkinson’s Disease Dementia by the (arbitrary) “one-year ru le” criterion where the onset of dementia within 12 months of the ons et of parkinsonism is st ated to be consistent with dementia with Lewy bodies whereas if parkinsonism has been present for more than 12 months prior to the onset of dem entia, the condition is considered to represent Parkinson’s Disease Dementia . The neuropathological abnormalities that underlie both conditions are cons idered to be similar with changes considered distinctive for Parkins on’s Disease being combined with other pathology, notably Alzheimer-type changes. W hether these entities are the same disease or separate distinct entities is still a matter of some controversy, although the consensus view appears to be that they are the same neurobiological entity with clinical phenotypes that differ, based so lely on the arbitrary “one-year rule.” Note that the revised criteria for t he diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies include the following “centra l” (required) feature: “Dementia defined as progressive cognitive decline of suffici ent magnitude to inte rfere with normal social or occupational function. Prominent or persistent memory impairment may not necessarily occur in the early stages, but is usually evident with progression. Deficits on tests of attention, executive function, and visuospatial ability may be especially prominent.” The publication that describes these revised diagnostic criteria (McKeith et al [2005]) further states the following: “The cognitive profile of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) co mprises both cortical and subcortical impairments with substantial attentional deficits and prominent executive and visuospatial dysfunction. A “double discrimination” c an help differentiate DLB from Alzheimer disease (AD), with relative preservation of confrontation naming and short and medium term recall as we ll as recognition, and greater impairment on verbal fluency, visual perception and performance tasks.” These cognitive abnormalities are similar to those descr ibed by a number of authors as being distinctive for Parkinson’s Disease Dementia Thus the same (reportedly) distinctive c linical features may be common to both dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkin son’s Disease Dementia, while both entities may also have the same neuropathological basis.

In fa ct, the criteria used to diagnose dementia itself in these patients may have been no different than those used for patients enrolled in the key pr e-approval efficacy trials of Exelon® in Alzheimer’s Disease. Admittedly, the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for the diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s Disease, which were used to enroll patients in the pre-approval efficacy trials of Exelon®, if strictly applied, required the exclusion of pati ents with Parkinson’s Disease. In their essence, the criteria us ed to diagnose dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease in Study 2311 consisted of the following  Presence of Parkinson’s Disease  Presence of dementia syndrome, without that dementia syndrome needing to have any distinctive features specific to Parkinson’s Disease Dementia  Evidence of Parkinson’s Disease prior to, but within 2 years of, the onset of dementia  Exclusion of other causes of dementia While the latter criteria do have face validity for diagnosing dementia in patients with Parkinson’s Disease, they themselves do not appear to have been correlated with neuropathological findings in a formal study (especially one that was prospective) of sufficient size (the recently-published study by Braak et al [see below] might, however, address that objective to some extent)

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 • It is noteworthy that the effects or rivastigmine on the primary efficacy measures in Study 2311 are not very different from those observed for rivastigmine, and, indeed other acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors, on the same measures in the key pre-approval efficacy trials of those drugs in mild to moderate probable Alzheimer’s Disease: in addition, the clinical course of the placebo group in Study 2311 and the placebo groups in the pre-approval efficacy trials of Exel on® in Alzheimer’s Disease were similar, also suggesting that the study populations in each instance may have been similar too (see below): The following were the changes seen in the Exelon® and placebo groups on the ADAS-Cog in a key pre-approval efficacy trial in Alzheimer’s Disease (the figure is taken from the approved product labeling The following were the corresponding changes seen in Study 2311 As noted earlier, in patients with Park inson’s Disease who develop dementia, Alzheimer’s-type pathology (neurofib rillary tangles, amyloid plaques) frequently co-exists, albeit often not to a sufficient degree for a separate pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Dis ease to be made. If a similar mixed pathology underlay the dem entia in patients enrolled in the Study 2311, it is possible (and no evidence to the cont rary has been supplied) that the

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 apparent benefit of rivastigmine in that study was mediated through its effects on co-existing Alzheimer’s-type pathology. It is unlikely that the criteria used to diagnose dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease in Study 2311, could have excluded those with co-exi sting Alzheimer’s-type pathology, despite a stipulation in those criteria that other c auses of dementia should be excluded. These observations raise the question of whether the efficacy of rivastigmine in dementia associated with Parkinso n’s Disease, as seen in the population enrolled in Study 2311, is really distinct from its already-established effects in mild to moderate probable Alzheimer’s Dis ease, and for which rivastigmine is already approved. As explained further below, the overa ll design of this trial was otherwise similar in many ways to the now-st andard study design used to demonstrate the efficacy of drugs intended for the tr eatment of Alzheimer’s Disease, again raising the question of how distinct the e ffects of Exelon® in this study were from those already establis hed in Alzheimer’s Disease. Unless the efficacy of rivastigmine as demonstrated in Study 2311 is judged to be mechanistically dist inct from its established effects in Alzheimer’s Disease, the grant of a s eparate claim for the treatm ent of mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease may not be justified. 2.3.4 Was the populatio n enrolled in Study 2311 otherwise selected appropriately? • Among the exclusion criteria for th is study were the following (I have emphasized elements of these cr iteria in bold underlined font)  Current diagnosis of any primary neurodegenerative disease other than Parkinson’s Disease or any other causes of dementia (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington’s Disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson-plus syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy or olivopontocerebellar degeneration, Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, hypothyroidism or syphilis)  A current diagnosis of probable or possible vascular dementia according to the NINDS-AIREN criteria, i.e., clinical and brain imaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease and a relationship between dementia and cerebrovascular disease (Reviewer’s note: these are criteria for the diagnosis of probable vascular dementia only; the diagnosis of possible vascular dementia does not require the demonstration of a clear relationship between dementia and stroke) • Special diagnostic laboratory test s that were performed at screening and which were intended to help exclude other causes of dementia were serum TSH, folic acid, Vitamin B12 and RPR.

Ranjit B. Mani, MD, HFD-120 Medical Review of 93 NDA 20823 (SE1-016), Exelon® (rivastigmine tartrate) , Novartis 4/18/06 • However, under the protocol for St udy 2311, brain imaging (i.e., computerized tomography or magne tic resonance scanning) was not required prior to entr y into the study. Study Case Report Forms do not document which patients may have had br ain imaging prior to entry into the study, and at the time that this re view was completed, data as to the proportion of study patients who had undergone brain imaging had not yet been made available by the sponsor in response to a request from us. The following observations may be pertinent in this context:  The American Academy of Neurology Practice Parameter for Dementia (see Knopman et al below) recommends the use of a neuroimaging examination (either a non-contrast CT scan or MRI scan) “under most circumstances” at the time of the initial dementia assessment to identify pathology such as brain neoplasms or subdural hematomas, although it is also stated that a third condition, normal pressure hydrocephalus, which might be detected by CT or MRI is very rare  The UK Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson’s Disease list as an exclusion criterion (Step 2) “the presence of cerebral tumor or communicating hydrocephalus on CT scan.” [However, it can hardly be considered standard clinical practice for brain imaging to be performed routinely for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease]  In key efficacy trials of drugs in Alzheimer’s Disease, it is standard practice to perform either a CT scan of the head or MRI at screening, if not performed within the preceding 12 months  A standard neurological examination directed at detecting focal neurological deficits is more difficult to perform in patients with Parkinson’s Disease, and often considerably more difficult • The question may therefore be raised as to how adequately patients enrolled in Study 2311 were evalua ted for “non-degenerative” causes of dementia such as cerebrovascula r lesions, brain tumors, subdural hematomas, and communicating hydrocephalus in the absence of brain imaging. Admittedly, tho se conditions are often associated with additional symptoms and si gns on neurological evaluation, but a standard neurological evaluation can be more difficult than usual to perform in patients with co- existing Parkinson’s Disease so that subtle physical signs may not be detected. 2.3.5 Was the overall design of Study 2311 appropriate and were the primary efficacy measures used suitable for evaluating the efficacy and safety of rivastigmine in mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease? • The paradigm used for designing this st udy is very similar to that used in standard efficacy trials in Alzheimer’s Disease.

Assuming that the condition itself is a distinct ent ity justifying a separate claim, the following might need consideration in dec iding whether the desi gn for that study was appropriate for the proposed indication:  The natural clinical course of Parkinson’s Disease Dementia, for which information is lacking  The nature of the cognitive deficits seen in that entity  Whether the outcome measures, and especially, the ADAS-Cog were appropriate to use in Parkinson’s Disease Dementia. The ADAS-Cog is not, for example, particularly appropriate for evaluating executive function (also note that the just-issued American Academy of Neurology Practice Parameter [see Miyasaki et al, below] also states that in patients with Parkinson’s Disease, it may be difficult to assess impairments in domains other than memory). • The results of non-interventional study (Study 2314) that was intended to validate several assessment scale s used in Study 2311 have been interpreted by the sponsor to demonstrate the following:  That the ADAS-Cog score can differentiate between dementia associated with Parkinson’s Disease of mild and moderate severities, as can the scores several of the secondary efficacy assessment instruments used in this study  That the ADAS-Cog and several secondary efficacy measures had test- retest reliability in this population  That the ADAS-Cog scores correlated with those of several other efficacy instruments, whether those measures assessed cognition or other domains  A factor analysis that compared populations with Parkinson’s Disease Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease on ADAS-Cog sub-item scores had indicated that the sub-items grouped differently in each population, suggesting that the cognitive and behavioral profiles in these populations might differ

It is currently unclear as to whether it is currently possible for a conclusion to be reached that the ADAS-Cog has content validity in this population. The factor analysis referred to above suggest ed that the cognitive profiles in Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease differ. 2.3.6 Could the apparent beneficial effects of Exelon® on cognition and/or global function in Study 2311 have been due to a beneficial effect on the motor manifestations of Parkinson’s Disease rather than on the dementia itself? If there was a beneficial effect of Exelon® on specific motor manifestations of Parkinson’s Disease such as bradykinesia or dysarthria, it is possible that such a benefit may have been reflected in a benef icial effect on the ADAS-Cog and/or ADCS-CGIC, in the absence of a tr ue effect on the dementia itself Such a possibility is unlikel y for the following reasons  There was no overall difference between treatment groups in the mean change from baseline to endpoint in total UPDRS motor scores. Notable differences between treatment groups were not seen for important individual UPDRS item scores  Adverse events that might be considered to represent a worsening in the motor manifestations of Parkinson’s Disease were, in aggregate, more common in those assigned to Exelon® than in those assigned to placebo [Also note that the study procedures included a number of precautions to minimize the effects of the motor manifestations of Parkinson’s Disease on the efficacy assessments]. 2.3.7 Do the results of Study 2311 wa rrant replication for a claim for the treatment of dementia associated wit h Parkinson’s Disease to be granted? All drugs approved by this Agency so fa r for the treatment of dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (Alzheimer’s Disease) have been approved based on the demonstration of the desired treatment effect in at least 2 adequate and well- controlled trials; the same has applied to the approval of drugs for other discrete clinical entities. This Division’s view so far is that the same principle must apply to other types of dementia, unless they are variants or grades of severity of Alzheimer’s Disease not subsum ed under the current claim. Therefore, if dementia asso ciated with Parkinson’s Disease is indeed a form of dementia that is distinct from Alzheimer’ s Disease, it would be appropriate to require that the results of Study 2311 be replicated.

Salient safety findings for this study were as follows.  The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and tremor was appreciably higher in the rivastigmine group than in the placebo group; a similar adverse event profile was seen in the key controlled clinical tria ls of Exelon® in Alzheimer’s Disease  Several treatment-emergent adverse events that may have represented a worsening in the motor manifestations of Parkinson’s Disease, tremor in particular, were more frequent in those treated with Exelon® than in those treated with placebo. However, changes in UPDRS total motor scores, probably a more objective measure of change in the motor manifestations of Parkinson’s Disease than the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, showed no meaningful difference between treatment groups. 3.2 Study 2311E1 This was an 24-week open-label uncontrolle d extension to Study 2311 intended primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Exelon® in the study

Patients given the option of enrolling in this study had either completed the double-blind treatment phas e of Study 2311 or discontinued early during that study, but returned for all the remaining scheduled efficacy assessments without significant protocol vi olations. Regardless of their previous treatment assignment, patients enrolled in th e extension study were all re-titrated to a flexible dose of Exelon® that ranged from 1.5 mg BID to 6.0 mg BID, based on tolerability. 433 patients enrolled in Study 2311 were eligible to enroll in Study 2311E1 of whom 334 actually consented to parti cipate and 273 completed the study. The adverse event profile of Exelon® in St udy 2311 was broadly similar to that seen in Study 2311E1 Conclusions Deferred, pending discussion of this appl ication at a scheduled meeting of the Peripheral and Central Nervous Systems Drugs Advisory Committee Recommendation Deferred, pending discussion of this appl ication at a scheduled meeting of the Peripheral and Central Nervous Systems Drugs Advisory Committee Ranjit B.
