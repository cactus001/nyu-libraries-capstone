Include the investment’s specific contribution to mission delivery or agency management support functions and identify key customers, stakeholders, and other beneficiaries. The Modernize and Innovate the Delivery of Agricultural Systems (MIDAS) program will transform Farm Service Agency's (FSA) delivery of Farm Program benefits, on behalf of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), into a 21st century business model. This project will provide capability to meet the increasing demand for customer self-service and eliminate FSA's reliance on aging technology. This project will reduce the risk of hardware failure by replacing the farm program applications residing on the outdated AS400/S36 computing platform with an integrated COTS solution, SAP. This project will reengineer business processes to be common and centralize data assets to support farm programs, eliminate program specific duplication of functionality and non-integrated, distributed data that exists between farm program software applications. It will accomplish increased compliance with modern internal control structures and effectively implement improved IT security. MIDAS will install commitment-based accounting practices (e.g., obligations, commitments, outlays, funds control) to upgrade both the program and financial management business practices of the CCC. The project is intended to align with Office of the Chief Financial Officer's (OCFO) Financial Management Modernization Initiative (FMMI) investment. Briefly describe how the investment contributes to the agency target EA and its role in the Enterprise Roadmap. Include a description of how the investment includes or will achieve programmatic or technical innovation. MIDAS is aligned with USDA Target Enterprise Architecture. The USDA EA Division (EAD) is creating an initial Enterprise Roadmap where MIDAS will be explicitly named and highlighted as one of the most important IT investments for USDA. MIDAS can be considered to be well aligned with the USDA Target Enterprise Architecture. MIDAS is aligned with USDA / 11 of Section300 Date of Last Revision: 2013-06-25 Exhibit 300 (2012)

EXHIBIT 300 UII 005-000001870 2010-2015 Strategic Plan. Initiative IV: Leverage USDA Departmental Management to Increase Performance, Efficiency, and Alignment - MIDAS will help to reduce Improper Payments through an integrated solution that will streamline the payment process and reduce human errors. - MIDAS will leverage streamlined operations of FMMI to disburse payments. Initiative V: Optimize Information Technology (IT) Policy and Applications - MIDAS will leverage the latest technology to improve and support program delivery of services, benefits and communication - MIDAS will implement an integrated COTS solution providing a secured and robust delivery platform for Farm Benefit Programs MIDAS is aligned with Farm Service Agency (FSA) 2012-2016 Strategic Plan. Strategic Goal 4: Transform and modernize the Farm Service Agency As stated in FSA Strategic Plan 2012-2016, the FSA is transforming its systems and applications into a set of enterprise services and eliminating legacy systems, servers, and duplicative data environments. Achieving the goal of transforming and modernizing key systems, business processes, and support activities will facilitate mission success and enhance the accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness of service delivery. Objective 4.3: Modernize Program and Service Delivery MIDAS will allow FSA to respond more promptly to customer demands and meet future challenges.
